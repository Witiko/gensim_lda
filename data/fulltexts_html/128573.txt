Abstract
This paper presents our approach and results for the 2017 PAN Author Profiling Shared Task. Language-specific corpora were provided for four langauges: Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Arabic. Each corpus consisted of tweets authored by a number of Twitter users labeled with their gender and the specific variant of their language which was used in the documents (e.g. Brazilian or European Portuguese). The task was to develop a system to infer the same attributes for unseen Twitter users. Our system employs an ensemble of two probabilistic classifiers: a Logistic regression classifier trained on TF-IDF transformed n-grams and a Gaussian Process classifier trained on word embedding clusters derived for an additional, external corpus of tweets.
