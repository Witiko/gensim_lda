Title: Job-related discourse on social media
Authors: Tong Liu, Christopher M. Homan, Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm, Ann Marie White, Megan C. Lytle-Flint, Henry A. Kautz

Abstract: Working adults spend nearly one third of their daily time at their jobs. In this paper, we study job-related social media discourse from a community of users. We use both crowdsourcing and local expertise to train a classifier to detect job-related messages on Twitter. Additionally, we analyze the linguistic differences in a job-related corpus of tweets between individual users vs. commercial accounts. The volumes of job-related tweets from individual users indicate that people use Twitter with distinct monthly, daily, and hourly patterns. We further show that the moods associated with jobs, positive and negative, have unique diurnal rhythms.
