Title: Variations of the Similarity Function of TextRank for Automated Summarization
Authors: Federico Barrios, Federico López, Luis Argerich, Rosa Wachenchauzer
(Submitted on 11 Feb 2016)
Abstract: This article presents new alternatives to the similarity function for the TextRank algorithm for automatic summarization of texts. We describe the generalities of the algorithm and the different functions we propose. Some of these variants achieve a significative improvement using the same metrics and dataset as the original publication.
