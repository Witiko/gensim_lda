Abstract

 
Scaling up the analysis of sensitive or confidential documents frequently stumbles on the limited number of individuals with the necessary clearance to access the documents. The availability of cryptographic protocols compatible with text processing methods can greatly improve this situation allowing for the automated processing of large corpora of confidential documents by ``untrusted'' third-parties. In this paper we propose a protocol which allows for secure outsourcing of text analytics tasks without compromising the confidentiality of documents. The method scales to large corpora, and presents linear time complexity on the size of the corpus.
