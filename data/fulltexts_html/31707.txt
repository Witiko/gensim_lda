Abstract
Social media has become a new channel for both brands and social media users. On social media channels, not only does a brand provide messages to their followers, but also social media users consume, contribute, and create brand related messages. In these social media messages, the brand personality that consumers actually do think and feel is included. In previous brand personality research, surveys have been the primary research methodology, however in this study, text mining in social media was utilized to examine brand personality. More specifically, Twitter messages, including the keywords Apple, Samsung, iPhone, and Galaxy, were collected and examined.
