Abstract
In this work, we create and make available two benchmark data sets for evaluating models of semantic word similarity for Norwegian. While such resources are available for English, they did not exist for Norwegian prior to this project. We also produce large-coverage semantic vectors trained on a selection of various corpora using several popular word embedding frameworks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the created resources for evaluating performance of different word embedding models on the tasks of analogical reasoning and synonym extraction.
