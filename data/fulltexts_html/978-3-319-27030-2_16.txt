Abstract
We propose a plot-based recommendation system, which is based upon an evaluation of similarity between the plot of a video that was watched by a user and a large amount of plots stored in a movie database. Our system is independent from the number of user ratings, thus it is able to propose famous and beloved movies as well as old or unheard movies/programs that are still strongly related to the content of the video the user has watched. The system implements and compares the two Topic Models, Latent Semantic Allocation (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), on a movie database of two hundred thousand plots that has been constructed by integrating different movie databases in a local NoSQL (MongoDB) DBMS. The topic models behaviour has been examined on the basis of standard metrics and user evaluations, performance assessments with 30 users to compare our tool with a commercial system have been conducted.

The system has been developed in collaboration between the database group of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and vfree.tv (http://vfree.tv), a young and innovative German company focused on creating new ways of distributing television content and generating an unprecedented watching experience for the user.
We also want to express our gratitude to Tania Farinella, Matteo Abbruzzo and Olga Kryukova, master students in Computer Engineering and Science at the Department of Engineering “Enzo Ferrari” at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia for their contribution in term of implementation of the first and second version of the system (without and with LDA) and for their support during the evaluation of the system. Particular appreciation goes to Serena Sorrentino that helps us to integrate the LDA models in our system.
