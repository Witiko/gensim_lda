Abstract
The potential of mining tourist information from social multimedia data gives rise to new applications offering much richer impressions of the city. In this paper we propose Scenemash, a system that generates multimodal summaries of multiple alternative routes between locations in a city. To get insight into the geographic areas on the route, we collect a dataset of community-contributed images and their associated annotations from Foursquare and Flickr. We identify images and terms representative of a geographic area by jointly analysing distributions of a large number of semantic concepts detected in the visual content and latent topics extracted from associated text. Scenemash prototype is implemented as an Android app for smartphones and smartwatches.
