Abstract
We propose a novel task, the chronological classification of poems. Houman’s research methodology, which we have adopted here, has provided us with labels for the ghazals that we used as training data in order to train automatic classifiers to classify the rest of the ghazals. To achieve our objective, we have prepared a corpus of Hafez poems in digital form with consistent idiosyncratic linguistic behaviors. Our classification framework uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised methods: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based similarity features.
Keywords
Poetry Chronological classification LDA SVM Similarity Prototype

We would like to thank Mr. Mehran Rahgozar for his invaluable linguistic insights, expert evaluations and remarkable support especially in the preparation of the Hafez Corpus. Our gratitude also goes to Mr. Mehran Raad who helped with evaluating the results.
