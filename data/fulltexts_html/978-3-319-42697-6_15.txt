Abstract
This study attempts to explore and triangulate with different methods the essence, definition, and methods of the grassroots practitioner term growth hacking. In the qualitative first part of our study, we conduct 12 expert informant interviews and a case study. In the quantitative second part of the study, we conduct a quantitative Twitter analysis to gain additional insights on the findings from the qualitative first part. As a result, we differentiate growth hacking from traditional marketing strategies and create a growth hacking process model depicting a sort of consensus of what can be thought to be integral parts of growth hacking.
