Abstract
The paper presents a free and open source toolkit which aim is to quickly deploy web services handling distributed vector models of semantics. It fills in the gap between training such models (many tools are already available for this) and dissemination of the results to general public. Our toolkit, WebVectors, provides all the necessary routines for organizing online access to querying trained models via modern web interface. We also describe two demo installations of the toolkit, featuring several efficient models for English, Russian and Norwegian.
