Abstract
Finding Semantic similarity is an important component in various fields such as information retrieval, question-answering system, machine translation and text summarization. This paper describes two different approaches to find semantic similarity on SemEval 2016 dataset. First method is based on lexical analysis whereas second method is based on distributed semantic approach. Both approaches are trained using feed-forward neural network and layer-recurrent network to predict the similarity score.
Keywords
Similarity Score Semantic Similarity Test Dataset Machine Translation Recurrent Neural Network 
These keywords were added by machine and not by the authors. This process is experimental and the keywords may be updated as the learning algorithm improves.
