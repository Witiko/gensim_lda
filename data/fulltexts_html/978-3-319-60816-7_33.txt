Abstract
There is a growing need for automatic extraction of information and knowledge from the increasing amount of biomedical and clinical data produced, namely in textual form. Natural language processing comes in this direction, helping in tasks such as information extraction and information retrieval. Word sense disambiguation is an important part of this process, being responsible for assigning the proper concept to an ambiguous term.
In this paper, we present results from machine learning and knowledge-based algorithms applied to biomedical word sense disambiguation. For the supervised machine learning algorithms we used word embeddings, calculated from the full MEDLINE literature database, as global features and compare the results to the use of local unigram and bigram features.
For the knowledge-based method we represented the textual definitions of biomedical concepts from the UMLS database as word embedding vectors, and combined this with concept associations derived from the MeSH term co-occurrences.
Both the machine learning and the knowledge-based results indicate that word embeddings are informative and improve the biomedical word disambiguation accuracy. Applied to the reference MSH WSD data set, our knowledge-based approach achieves 85.1% disambiguation accuracy, which is higher than some previously proposed approaches that do not use machine-learning strategies.
