Abstract
This contribution investigates whether companies cluster together according to their field of industry using word embeddings and in particular word2vec models on general news text. We explore to what extent this can be utilised for identifying company-industry affiliations automatically. We present an experiment in which we test seven different classification methods on four different word2vec models trained on a 600-million-word corpus from the Guardian newspaper. For training and testing our classifiers we obtained company-industry assignments from the Dbpedia knowledge base for those companies occurring in both the news corpus and Dbpedia. The majority of the 28 scrutinized classification paradigms displays F1 scores near 80%, with some exceeding this threshold. We found differences across industries, with some industries appearing to be more distinctly defined, while others are less clearly delineated from neighbouring fields. To test the robustness of our approach we conducted a field test, identifying candidate companies absent from Dbpedia with a named-entity recognizer, establishing ground truth on company and industry status manually through web search. We found classifier performance to be less reliable in the field test and of varying quality across industries. with precision at 25 values ranging from 16% to 88%, depending on industry. In summary, the presented approach showed some promise, but also some limitations and may in its current form be only robust enough for semi-automated classification.
