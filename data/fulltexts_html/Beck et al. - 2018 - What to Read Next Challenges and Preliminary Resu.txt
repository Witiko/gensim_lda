Abstract.
The vast amount of
scientific literature poses a challenge
when one is trying to understand a previously unknown topic.
Select-
ing a representative subset of documents that covers most of the desired
content can solve this challenge by presenting the user a small subset of
documents.
We build on existing research on representative subset ex-
traction and apply it in an information retrieval setting. Our document
selection process consists of
three steps:
computation of
the document
representations,
clustering,
and selection of
documents.
We implement
and compare two different document representations, two different clus-
tering algorithms,
and three different selection methods using a cover-
age and a redundancy metric.
We execute our 36 experiments on two
datasets,
with 10 sample queries each,
from different domains.
The re-
sults show that there is no clear favorite and that we need to ask the
question whether coverage and redundancy are sufficient for evaluating
representative subsets.

Introduction
As an early-stage researcher or practitioner, delving into a new, previously un-
known topic usually starts with issuing broad queries to a search engine. The aim
of such an introductory search is to get an overview of the different subtopics,
most fundamental
works in the field,
and the state-of-the-art.
Search engines
return those documents which best match with the user query and present the
results as a ranked list. Such a relevance-based ranking works well for standard
information retrieval (IR) tasks, but it is not suited for finding a complete, repre-
sentative, and comprehensive selection when exploring a new field. Furthermore,
the large number of search results makes it very time-consuming for the user to
identify the desired documents because similarly ranked documents have usually
similar content. Thus, result lists are often highly redundant, especially the top
results (i. e., the first page) that are usually only considered by the user. It is also

difficult to estimate at which position of the ranked list one has read about all
aspects of a topic [3], i. e., got a representative overview, because the breakpoint
differs from one topic to another.
A representative subset can address these challenges. In general, a representa-
tive subset is considered as a selection which covers most of the content, contains
the least possible amount of
redundant information,
and is notably smaller in
size than the original dataset. Zhang et al. [21] proposed such a method for text
documents that uses clustering and a coverage and redundancy based selection to
create a representative subset from a set of documents. We have re-implemented
the work of Zhang et al. and evaluated it on search results created from queries
issued to two datasets of different domains. Based on the results of preliminary
experiments, we decided to investigate the following research questions:
– RQ1: What influence does the choice of a) document representation, b) clus-
tering algorithm, and c) selection method have on the coverage and redun-
dancy scores of the representative subset?
– RQ2:
Are the evaluation metrics,
coverage and redundancy,
sufficient to
evaluate the representativeness of a document set?
The outline of this paper is: In Section 2, we briefly discuss related work fol-
lowed by an introduction of our approach in Section 3. We describe our datasets,
metrics,
and experiment setup in Section 4.
Finally,
we present our results in
Section 5 and discuss them before we conclude.

Related Work
Zhang et al. [21] propose a selection technique which uses an unsupervised text
mining approach to find a representative set of documents from a large corpus.
They first cluster the documents using X-Means, an adaption of K-Means which
can be used without prior specification of the cluster number k, to identify the
different topics in the dataset.
From each cluster,
they extract the documents
which maximize the content coverage and introduce as less redundant content as
possible. The size of the result set is determined by the proportional sizes of the
clusters.
Their framework outperforms a greedy approach,
which directly opti-
mizes for coverage, and a top-n method, which selects the best n documents with
regards to coverage.
The authors conducted a user study with 20 participants
that indicated a preference for their selection approach.
The task of
generating reading lists [7]
is quite similar to selecting repre-
sentative documents.
However,
it aims more to propose subjective and expert-
based reading lists rather than an objective,
representative selection.
Jardine
and Teufel
[8]
proposed an adaptation to the PageRank score,
called Themed-
PageRank (TPR),
which has an LDA-inferred topic dimension and a so-called
age-tapering component to incorporate the time aspect. They compute the TPR
for each document that is returned by an IR system given a specific query. They
rank the documents based on TPR and return the top-20 documents as reading
list.
Their evaluation using expert-created reading lists showed improvements

on previous state-of-the-art models based on PageRank.
A recent approach by
Zhang et al. [20] generates book reading lists for certain topics. They use data ob-
tained from social media to train vector representations for each topic-book pair
using content from social media for relevance, quality, timeliness, and diversity.
We base our experiments on the work by Zhang et al.
[21].
However,
they
compared their selection to methods which optimize for coverage only, but not
for redundancy, which limits the comparability. Furthermore, only X-Means was
considered for clustering and no information is given about the actual
number
of
documents retrieved from the datasets,
which is an important factor when
searching for a small representative document set. Thus, we extend in this paper
on the work of Zhang et al.
and compare different clustering algorithms,
selec-
tion methods,
and document representations while taking inspiration from the
literature.
Please note that we decided to deliberately exclude approaches for result list
re-ranking since they are not well comparable to a representative subset, due to
the unknown breakpoint [3],
as discussed in the introduction.
Furthermore,
we
exclude approaches from the related area of text summarization [13] since they
work on a different granularity level.

Document Selection
Our approach for document selection is based on Zhang et al. [21] and consists
of three steps (see Fig. 1). First, we retrieve the documents that match a certain
query and compute the representations of the documents in the result set. Sec-
ond, we cluster the documents into topics. Third, we select documents from the
clusters to form a representative subset.
Thus,
we extend Zhang by an initial
retrieval
step to address the retrieval
setting.
Below,
we introduce for each of
the three steps the different methods that we compare in our experiments.
3.1
Document Representation
We use two different document representations in our experiments, Bag-of-Words
and Paragraph Vectors.
Bag-of-Words:
The classical
Bag-of-Words (BOW) model
represents each
document as a vector that contains the weighted term counts for every term of
the dataset.
Whissell
et al.
[19]
have investigated the effect of different feature
weighting approaches on the document clustering performance. They concluded
that BM25 outperforms other feature weighting approaches and suggested to use
BM25 for clustering tasks.
Paragraph Vectors:
Paragraph Vectors,
which were introduced by Le and
Mikolov [9],
are dense vector
representations
of
text
fragments
of
arbitrary
length, i. e., paragraphs, or documents, in a significantly lower-dimensional space
than the corpus’
dictionary.
They are generated by neural
networks that are
trained to predict the words surrounding a given word. Those vectors are able to
carry semantic information,
thus making them often superior to BOW models
which ignore word ordering. This process is called doc2vec (D2V).

3.2
Clustering
We use spherical
k-Means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to cluster the docu-
ments into topics. Please note that we do not use X-Means, which was used by
Zhang et al. [21], since it is too slow, as Zhang et al. stated themselves in a more
recent work [22].
Spherical
K-Means: K-Means [11] (KM) is a centroid-based clustering algo-
rithm that iteratively assigns each datapoint to the nearest centroid and then
recomputes the centroids from the assigned points until it converges. For a larger
number of dimensions, when using the Euclidean Distance, the curse of dimen-
sionality leads to uniform distances between data points [1], limiting the appli-
cability.
However,
the distance metric can be exchanged with cosine similarity
without violating the Gaussian distribution assumption underlying K-Means.
This spherical K-Means [5] is more suitable for the application on textual data
and thus is used in our experiments.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [4] is a proba-
bilistic, generative model which identifies hidden topics in a corpus of documents.
The basic idea of LDA is that documents are represented as a mixture of topics
and each topic is identified by a distribution over words. Given a document cor-
pus, LDA infers a model that is likely to have generated that corpus. LDA takes
the term-document count matrix as input and creates a n × k document-topic
matrix W with n documents and k topics.
An entry W
i,j
describes the proba-
bility that topic j is contained in document i. We can use these probabilities to
cluster the documents into topic clusters. To adhere to our goal of clustering the
documents into topics and then selecting representatives per topic,
we decided
to keep it simple and cluster the documents by assigning them to the topic for
which they have the highest probability.

3.3
Selection
We consider two selection strategies and a baseline.
The number of
selected
documents results from the cluster proportions as proposed by Zhang et al. [21].
This means that we select twice as many documents from a cluster if it is twice as
big as another cluster. Thus, the smallest cluster, and the number of documents
selected from it, determines the size of the result set.
Selection by coverage and redundancy: Zhang et al. [21] proposed a coverage
and redundancy based selection (CR).
First,
from each cluster,
the document
that is closest to the centroid is selected since it has the highest coverage inside
the cluster. Subsequently, the documents with the lowest similarity to the previ-
ously selected documents are extracted to minimize redundant content inside the
selected set.
For all
clustering algorithms,
except LDA-based clustering,
cosine
similarity is used to compute the similarity between documents.
In the case of
LDA, the Jensen-Shannon divergence [10] is used because it is more suitable for
probability distributions.
Selection by User Intent :
The Intent Aware selection [2]
(IA) of documents
is based on the relevance of the documents to the query and the probability to
satisfy any of the k topics. It maximizes the marginal utility, which is the sum
over all topics of the product of the retrieval score and the conditional probability
that the so far selected documents failed to represent that topic. The overall goal
is to increase the diversity of topics among the selected documents. The original
Intent Aware method does not use clustering and selects documents based on
their probabilities to satisfy the query and the topics. Thus, theoretically, it can
happen that certain clusters are not considered at all. We address this by taking
at least one document per cluster (topic).
Random Selection:
To evaluate the usefulness of
the previously described
selection strategies, a random selection strategy (R) is introduced as a baseline.
From each cluster, based on their proportions, documents are chosen uniformly
at random into the representative subset.

Datasets
We use two datasets of
scientific publications for our experiments.
We have
sampled ten queries for each dataset from corresponding/suitable thesauri
for
our retrieval setting that return at least 1,000 documents (see Table 1).
ACL Anthology Network :
The ACL Anthology Network [15–17]
dataset is
a collection of research papers of different Association for Computational
Lin-
guistics (ACL) venues. We removed all documents that did not have a full-text,
leading to a dataset consisting of
22,486 English full-text papers.
The query
terms were selected from the ACM CCS
3
since the ACL thesaurus is still under
construction. On average, the queries return 1,500 documents.

Metrics
To ensure comparability, we evaluate our approach using the metrics by Ma et
al. [12] that were used by Zhang et al. [21]. Please note that sim() refers to the
cosine similarity, as it was chosen by Zhang et al [21].
Coverage:
Coverage evaluates how much content of a dataset D is covered
by a subset S:
coverage(S, D) =
1
|D|
X
r∈D
(max
d∈S
(sim(d, r)))
(1)
In the case that all
documents are selected,
the coverage reaches its maximal
value of
1.
The coverage will
be close to zero if
the selected set of
documents
only resembles a minimal fraction of the complete set of documents.
Redundancy:
The redundant information in a subset S is assessed by:
redundancy(S) =

Please note that this computation also considers the size of
the subset,
i. e.,
having a subset of three duplicates and a subset of five duplicates would yield
different scores. We are also aware that the metric has some short comings when
used with cosine similarity. However, for the sake of comparability, we use it as
it was used by Zhang et al. [21].
4.3
Experiment Setup
We indexed each dataset using the full-text of the documents and used BM25
(k1 = 1.2 and b = 0.75) as our scoring function for retrieval
in Elasticsearch
6
.
We retrieved the documents for each query by using exact matching and pre-
processed the resulting document set using Porter stemming [14] and stop-word
removal using NLTK stop-words before computing the document representation
(e. g.,
BoW or Paragraph Vectors).
To address the curse of
dimensionality,
all
terms that appeared in more than 95% of
the documents or in less than two
documents were removed.
We further limited our vocabulary to the remaining
50,000 most popular terms.
We calculated the document representation of the preprocessed documents
using the methods described in Section 3.1. In case of the BoW model, we used
BM25 with the parameters k1 = 20 and b = 1 based on a study of Whissell
et
al.
[19].
For the paragraph vector model,
we used a model
that was trained on
a dump of all English Wikipedia articles from December 2017 using the gensim
library [18].
Under the assumption that the topical
diversity is limited,
we decided to
cluster the documents with k ∈ {5, 10, 25, 50} since the true number of clusters
is unknown.
After clustering,
representative documents were selected from the clusters
using the proposed selection methods.
For the calculation of the selected set S
for the IA selection in combination with LDA, we follow the procedure described
in [6].
In the case of k-Means clustering (for both BOW and D2V),
we take a
different approach as the necessary probability distributions are not provided by
the clustering algorithm. We compute the quality value using the retrieval score,
weighted by the cosine distance of a document to its corresponding cluster center.
For the calculation of the conditional probability, first, the feature vector for the
query is derived from the vocabulary (or pretrained model in case of paragraph
vectors). Then, for each topic, the probability is the cosine distance between the
topic and the query. To compute the similarity between two documents, we use
the cosine similarity except for LDA-based clustering where the Jensen-Shannon
divergence is used.
To allow for
a fair
comparison between the different
document
selection
strategies,
we compute the metrics using the BM25-weighted BoW model
and
cosine similarity (or distance, respectively) even if the clustering was using dif-
ferent feature vectors (e. g., LDA-based clustering).

In total, we ran 36 experiments, each using a different combination of the 2
document representations, 2 clustering algorithms, 4 different values for k, and 3
different selections methods, on 20 different document sets, which were returned
by 10 queries on our two datasets.
We repeated each experiment 5 times and
averaged over all runs.

Results and Discussion
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the average coverage and redundancy values for the differ-
ent experiment configurations on the ACL and PubMed datasets,
respectively.
We analyze the results along the three components of RQ1:
a) document rep-
resentation,
b) clustering,
and c) selection.
To answer RQ1 a),
we look at the
results for K-Means using the bag-of-words model
(KM-BOW) and K-Means
using document embeddings (KM-D2V). On both datasets, for k=5 and k=10,
the coverage has no large difference but for the selection methods IA and R with
document embeddings there is slightly less redundancy. Starting from k=25, se-
lections based on KM-D2V have a higher coverage and a sharper increase in
redundancy. The use of D2V most likely influences the representative subset se-
lection so that for small k, slightly less redundant content is selected. For larger k,
clearly, more content is covered while the increase in redundancy is neglectable.

queries for the different document selection strategies on the PubMed dataset using
k ∈ {5, 10, 15, 20}.
The standard deviation is indicated as a black line on top of each
bar.
To answer RQ1 b), we compare the results of all clustering algorithms. Except
for LDA, the coverage and redundancy results for the strategies increase steadily
with larger k, all achieving their maximum at k=50. For LDA, both scores are
close to 1 when increasing to k=25 and above.
The differences between the
algorithms are more distinct at a larger k.
We compare the coverage and redundancy for the selection methods to answer
RQ1 c). One can see that the CR selection generates lower redundancy scores in
combination with KM-BOW clustering but the effect is diminishing with larger k.
For the other clustering algorithms, one can observe that CR has equal or higher
redundancy scores than the other selection methods.
In terms of coverage,
the
choice of the selection method is less important than the clustering algorithm as
the differences between CR, IA, and R are minimal.
Summarizing our results regarding RQ1, on both datasets, the best perform-
ing configurations,
with respect to coverage,
are those that use D2V or LDA.
However, the selections based on BOW have the lowest redundancy scores.
Regarding RQ2,
we make three observations with respect to coverage and
redundancy. First, the scores for both metrics increase consistently for a larger
number of clusters. This correlates directly with the number of documents due to
the cluster proportion calculation, which defines the number of documents that
are selected. In the case of more heterogeneous cluster sizes, more documents will
be selected from each cluster. With larger k, it is more likely that the documents
are unevenly distributed among the clusters.
One example is the LDA-based
10
T. Beck et al.
selection for k ∈ {25, 50},
which contains most documents and has coverage
scores close to 1. Thus, coverage and redundancy are inflated by selecting most
of the documents rather than being a result of a better selection.
Fig. 4.
Average fractions of
shared documents in the representative document sets,
selected by our nine different document selection strategies on the ACL dataset.
On
the left for k=5 and on the right for k=50.
Second, from the comparison with a random selection method, we observed
an independence of the evaluation metrics from the actual choice of documents.
This raises the question whether the selection methods select similar document
sets. Therefore, we decided to have a closer look at the subsets. Fig. 4 shows the
result of the comparison of the subsets for k=5 and k=50 at the example of ACL,
i. e., the fraction of mutual documents between the selection strategies. We can
see that for small k none of the selections share many similar documents, while
for a larger k strategies with the same document representation and clustering
algorithm (but different selection strategies) start to select similar documents.
However,
these document selections are more alike as more documents are se-
lected in general. This becomes obvious, especially for D2V and LDA, since both
are more susceptible to imbalanced cluster sizes. This limits the generalizability
of
coverage and redundancy to evaluate the representativeness of
a document
subset. Please note, we have omitted the analysis on the PubMed dataset since
the results were similar.
Finally,
in contrast to the original
work of
Zhang et al.
[21],
we observe
for each strategy that the redundancy exceeds the coverage scores.
We have
investigated whether it results from our IR setting and hence a general
higher
similarity of
documents.
However,
we achieved similar results when using an
equal
amount of
documents randomly sampled from the full
dataset.
Further
research needs to be conducted to explain the difference between the results on
our and Zhangs’ datasets.

Conclusion
We have proposed a document selection framework in an information retrieval
context as an extension of the representative subset selection by Zhang et al. [21].
Our analysis reveals that there is no unique representative document set with
regards to the evaluation metrics but instead most strategies achieve comparable
results with different document subsets,
even our random baseline.
This raises
the question whether coverage and redundancy are sufficient to evaluate the
representativeness of a document set. Furthermore, we identified the size of the
result set as problematic. It is often too large for a representative subset due to
the selection based on the cluster proportions. Therefore, as future work, we pro-
pose to enhance the representativeness metric introduced by Ma et al. [12] with
a weighting term which promotes those solutions which select fewer documents
for evaluating representative subsets. Finally, we plan to further investigate the
influence of different dataset characteristics and preprocessing methods on the
overall document selection process.
