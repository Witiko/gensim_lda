I was looking for a method to do something similar. I found two workable solutions.
The best was to use the Publish or Perish software (http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm). It cycles through the pages of a Google Scholar search results list and co
pies the basic information for each result to a results list that can be copied in CSV or Excel format.The other method was to use Zotero (www.zotero.org) as an add-on to Firefox. You can use it to save the results on a single page of a Google Scholar results list (maximum 20 items). The drawback of this is that there doesn't seem to be a way to cycle automatically through the entire results list.… Read more

Funny enough, a simple Google Search provides you with plenty of examples of how to extract Google results into CSV format which can be imported into Excel:

For Excel, in order to use the data, the data should be in an acceptable format with unique identifiers such as a "tab" or "comma" (the file for excel is called *.csv which stands for Comma Seperated Values). You may be able to do it more efficiently if you are good at SQL and with a bit of programing experience, but the easy suggestio
n would be to use MS Word. Copy - Paste the data and sort it in Descending order. You would anyhow have to manually delete the duplicates whether it is Excel or Word.Good luck.… Read more

My problem is that I am conducting Google searches of topics, defined by complex boolean search phrases. Publish or Perish does not handle that, so I am back in square one.

I am not sure if Mendeley can help in downloading list of papers to be further used for bibliometrics and SLRs. Mendeley allows you add one paper at a time, I think.
Giora, have you tried  "All of the words" field and checked "*Title words only"? I think it 
would help you even if you are using boolean search strings.Otherwise, consider replacing phrases with words for example, "information security management" OR "information security awareness" can be replaced by ("information security" AND ("management" OR awareness). Then "All of the words" field can be used.… Read more

Giora,
I can understand as I have been in the same situation as yours. If I have rightly understood, you have to use several variants of search string as the search keyword
s are too many; and you are not sure how to remove duplicates in this regard.If you are able to divide you search string into several smaller set of search strings, you can conduct search for every string separately. Download them into Excel using PoP, merge them and use "Remove duplicate" option in Excel. You will get unique records after that. Kindly be advised, PoP can only search 1000 records at a time and thus if you are going to have more than 1000 records within a particular timeline, you won't be able to see them. An alternative is to divide you searches into smaller timelines, for example. Also, due to repeated PoP queries to Google Scholar's servers, the server may lock you out for certain period of time.If nothing works, think of Web of Science or Scopus, for example. Both them have better "quality coverage" as compared to Google Scholar. Of course, citation scores from these two databases are less than Google Scholar but that will not make any difference if your aim is to conduct a literature review.… Read more

 Thank you. But how can I transfer the Google search results to PoP?

Ali Farooq

You will simply query PoP to execute the search string query. PoP automatically searches Google Scholar and lists the results in PoP which are then downloadable into CSV, TXT, XLS formats. PoP can also search in Microsoft Academic database, in case you are interested.
Daryl has given the link to the PoP's website and there is a very short tutorial on how to use it as well; may take 15-30 minutes to get yourself familiarize with PoP.… Read more

As I said it depends upon you need. If you wish to go through the extracted results using any software such as Mendeley or Refwork (select Results as Bibtex), in case Endnote or RefManager you can export the file in the respective format.
What I usually do is to export results to Excel with header. Once you click this option, the whole list with headers will be copied to the clip board. Now open the Excel sheet and simply "paste" or Ctrl+V. All the data will be copied to Excel sheet. Now you can save this sheet and do further analysis.… Read more

                    1. Google Scholar's Dramatic Coverage Improvement Five Years after Debut
[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This article reports a 2010 empirical study using a 2005 study as a base to compare Google Scholar's coverage of scholarly journals with commercial services. Through random samples of eight databases, the author finds that, as of 2010, Google Scholar covers 98 to 100 percent of scholarly journals from both publicly accessible Web contents and from subscription-based databases that Google Scholar partners with. In 2005 the coverage of the same databases ranged from 30 to 88 percent. The author explores de-duplication of search results by Google Scholar and discusses its impacts on searches and library resources. With the dramatic improvement of Google Scholar, the uniqueness and effectiveness of subscription-based abstracts and indexes have dramatically changed.

                    1. PRAKTIČNE VRIJEDNOSTI IZOKINETIČKE DIJAGNOSTIKE KAO ALATA ZA PREVENCIJU POVREDA U BORILAČKIM SPORTOVIMA
[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: UVOD: Sportska povreda kao pojam označava sve povrede koje su se dogodile za vrijeme tjelesne aktivnosti (takmičenje, trening, rekreacija). Raznovrsnost borilačkih sportova, kao i povreda u svakom pojedinom sportu je velika. Upravo izokinetička dijagnostika predstavlja tehnološki napredan postupak za evaluaciju relevantnih parametara koštano-mišićnog sistema. Izokinetički uređaj omogućava testiranoj osobi razvijanje maksimalne sile tokom cijelog opsega pokreta uz prilagođavanje otpora na bol ili zamor, zbog čega se prilikom mjerenja ne može pojaviti preopterećenje mišića ili zglobnih struktura. Specifičnost borilačkih sportova jeste korištenje mišića agonista u pokretima udaraca i kretanja prema naprijed. Ukoliko se ne vrši stalna kontrola odnosa snage antagonostičkih grupa svakog zgloba vrlo često se dešavaju povrede nedominante sinergijske mišićne strukture. S obzirom da procedure utvrđivanja izokinetičkih potencijala predstavljaju zlatni standard u modernom sportu, cilj ovoga rada je ukazivanje na značaj i vrijednost tog standarda. METODE: Pretraga literature vezane za istraživanje izvršena je na pretraživačima naučnih portala: Google Scholar i Reasearchgate, koje posjeduju mnogo kvalitetnih informacija. REZULTATI: Veliki broj publikacija ukazuje da su povrede nedominantnih mišićnih struktura veoma česte, prekidaju trenažni proces, teško se liječe i ostavljaju fizičke i psihološke posljedice. S obzirom na to da izokinetički dinamometar mjeri mišićne sile, rad i odnose tih sila može se reći da je njegovo korištenje nezaobilazno. Kontinuirano testiranje na izokinetičkom dinamometru vrlo je važno za utvrđivanje trenažnih efekata. Dugotrajni trenažni proces, a posebno u borilačkim sportovima dominantno razvija specifične mišićne grupe.
