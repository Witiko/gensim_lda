Highlights
•
We compare classical distributional semantics models to a new, prediction-based class of models.
•
In evaluation we use psycholinguistically relevant tasks, including a semantic priming megastudy.
•
We find that the new class of model generally provides a better or comparable fit to behavioral data.
•
We release pre-trained semantic spaces for Dutch and English and an open-source interface.
Abstract
Recent developments in distributional semantics (Mikolov, Chen, Corrado, & Dean, 2013; Mikolov, Sutskever, Chen, Corrado, & Dean, 2013) include a new class of prediction-based models that are trained on a text corpus and that measure semantic similarity between words. We discuss the relevance of these models for psycholinguistic theories and compare them to more traditional distributional semantic models. We compare the models’ performances on a large dataset of semantic priming (Hutchison et al., 2013) and on a number of other tasks involving semantic processing and conclude that the prediction-based models usually offer a better fit to behavioral data. Theoretically, we argue that these models bridge the gap between traditional approaches to distributional semantics and psychologically plausible learning principles. As an aid to researchers, we release semantic vectors for English and Dutch for a range of models together with a convenient interface that can be used to extract a great number of semantic similarity measures.
