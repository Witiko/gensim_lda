    • Abstract: Sentiment analysis in nowadays conducted mainly with specialized linguistic resources such as text corpus, sentiment lexicons and thesauruses. But the procedure of such resources creation is very time- and labor-consuming. Therefore the problem of creating the method which allows to detect polarity with minimal efforts and is based on automatically constructed sentiment lexicon is actual and important. The sentiment analysis task is required to be performed at various levels of details depending on the knowledge domain. In the article we discuss the task of aspect term polarity detection. The aspect term polarity detection method is proposed. It differs from the others by the way of automated sentiment lexicon construction based on pointwise mutual information and distributed representations of words. The results of experiments based on the corpus from international workshop SemEval-2014 are given and they show that the proposed method provides an acceptable quality in aspect term polarity detection task.
