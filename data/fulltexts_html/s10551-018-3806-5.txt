Abstract
This study focuses on examining the thematic landscape of the history of scholarly publication in business ethics. We analyze the titles, abstracts, full texts, and citation information of all research papers published in the field’s leading journal, the Journal of Business Ethics, from its inaugural issue in February 1982 until December 2016—a dataset that comprises 6308 articles and 42 million words. Our key method is a computational algorithm known as probabilistic topic modeling, which we use to examine objectively the field’s latent thematic landscape based on the vast volume of scholarly texts. This “big-data” approach allows us not only to provide time-specific snapshots of various research topics, but also to track the dynamic evolution of each topic over time. We further examine the pattern of individual papers’ topic diversity and the influence of individual papers’ topic diversity on their impact over time. We conclude this study with our recommendation for future studies in business ethics research.

Appendices
Appendix 1: Latent Dirichlet Allocation
We chose the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al. 2003) model as our probabilistic topic modeling method. As the first and the most mature topic model, LDA has emerged as a powerful and commonly used technique to reveal thematic information from digital archives (Griffiths and Steyvers 2004). Recently, it has received growing attention in various areas of management research, especially in the study of the historical evolution of ideas. For instance, recent work by Kaplan and Vakili (2015) mined topics in a body of knowledge concerning patents; Wang et al. (2015) employed topic modeling to conduct a historical review of research on consumer behavior; and Chen and Zhao (2015) used topic modeling to study the field of information systems. All of these studies used LDA.
An example will help convey the intuition behind LDA. Figure 7 is the abstract of “Ethical leadership behavior and employee justice perceptions: the mediating role of trust in organizations”—a research paper by Xu et al. (2016). Suppose a dedicated scholar read through every published JBE article and learned all the coherent topics in them. Upon reading the article in Fig. 7, she may identify that three of the topics are addressed here. We highlight these three topics in different colors: blue indicates the topic “ethical leadership”; green indicates the topic “employee ethical behaviors”; and yellow indicates the topic “virtue ethics.” The scholar can also decide the weights Xu et al. put on the three topics in the article. If the three topics are addressed equally in the article, she may annotate (“ethical leadership” = 0.33, “employee ethical behaviors” = 0.33, and “virtue ethics” = 0.34, where all weights must add up to 1.0).

Topics and associated words in a document
The sheer volume of articles makes human understanding, organizing, and annotating of the entire JBE archive a daunting—if not impossible—task. We use LDA to conduct the above analysis automatically. LDA builds upon the intuition that articles often exhibit multiple topics, and these topics are expressed using different words.10 LDA uses a probabilistic model and random variables to express the relationship between documents, topics, and words. The model inference process matches the probabilistic model with the observed JBE archive and provides the outputs we presented in the paper. Next, we introduce the assumptions behind LDA and inference process.
As with all other machine learning models, LDA starts with several statistical assumptions. First, an article is a “bag of words,” meaning that LDA ignores the order of words in an article. The order of the words is, of course, important for readers to understand an article. However, as Blei et al. (2003) have argued, this simplification (i.e., ignoring word order) can result in enhanced computational efficiency while largely preserving the semantic themes in the article. Second, LDA assumes that all articles in the archive share the same set of topics, but the topic proportions differ across articles (from 0 to 100% for any given topic). This assumption is based on the fact that all JBE authors share a body of knowledge, while different authors are experts in various sub-domains. As such, their articles will have different foci. Third, LDA assumes that each topic is manifested in the form of a cluster of topic-related keywords. These topic-related keywords are from fixed vocabulary of the totality of the article archive. Fourth, LDA assumes that the set of words contained in any given article is a combination of topic-related words from a variety of topics. The third and fourth assumptions lead to the generative process of LDA.
LDA is a generative model. The model assumes that the observed JBE articles are generated from a probabilistic process characterized by hidden (latent) random variables. The random variables are hidden from us, but all of the authors know about them. For our purpose, we focus on two sets of hidden random variables. The first is the per-document topic distribution. The parameters of this distribution could tell us, for each article, the likely weights of each topic. The second is the per-topic word distribution, the parameters of which could indicate the most likely words under each topic.11
With the two hidden distributions, LDA assumes that the procedure of writing a JBE article (i.e., generating the bag of words in the article) follows two main steps:
    1. 1.
       The authors pick the weight distribution of the topics for each article according to the per-document topic distribution. For example, 80% about CSR and 20% supply chain-related issues.
        
    2. 2.
       The authors choose the corresponding bag of words according to how words are related to topics (the per-topic word distribution). For example, use the word “social” 20 times, “stakeholder” 10 times, “contract” 5 times, “retailer” 3 times.
        
Given the collection of the JBE articles, which are the observable outcomes of the above generative process, our goal of the analysis is to uncover the per-document topic distribution and the per-topic word distribution. The inference algorithm of LDA reverses the above generative process using hierarchical Bayesian inference (Blei 2012). In other words, the algorithm tries to answer: assuming all the articles are indeed generated according to the above two steps, what are the most plausible document-topic distribution and topic-word distribution that gave rise to the observed JBE articles? The inference process gave us the results presented in the paper, namely (1) which topic(s) are covered in a given article and their proportions, and (2) the representative words for each topic.
Lastly, we describe our implementation details. We first downloaded our data from JSTOR Data for Research (dfr.jstor.org). We used gensism (Rehurek and Sojka 2010), an open-source natural language processing package for Python, for preprocessing and LDA inference. In the preprocessing stage, we used lemmatization to remove the inflectional endings of words. We excluded the most common (top 50), rare (less than 10 occurrences), and stop-words following the convention. The most common words are words that are generic terms such as business, ethic, study, research, while the rare words are usually study specific. Neither can help us learn the pervading themes in the articles. We then identified the most frequent bigrams and trigrams (two- and three-word terms) and concatenated them to words. In the LDA inference stage, gensism implements the online variational Bayes algorithm outlined in Bach et al. (2010). We chose the number of topics K = 18 using the perplexity measure, which is commonly used to evaluate a language model’s performance (Asuncion et al. 2009). In addition, the solution presented agrees with our human judgment in terms of semantic coherence and interpretation.
Appendix 2. Gini Coefficients
To analyze topic diversity, we utilize the way of calculating Gini coefficient—a measure usually used for income inequality (Gini 1909). In our analysis, the Gini coefficient is instead used to measure the inequality of the weight across the multiple topics examined by LDA model in a paper. The value of the Gini coefficient varies between “0” and “1”. The Gini coefficient “0” indicates complete equality, meaning the weight of each topic identified by the LDA model is the same. In this case, the diversity is high because all the topics are discussed with the same amount of scholarly attention (extremely spread). The Gini coefficient “1” indicates complete inequality, meaning that only one topic is discussed or gains all the scholarly attention (extremely concentrated). In this case, the diversity is low. Therefore, there is a negative relationship between the Gini coefficient and diversity. To make our analyses and results more intuitive, we transform Gini coefficient to the value of diversity by multiplying the initial Gini coefficient with “− 1”.
