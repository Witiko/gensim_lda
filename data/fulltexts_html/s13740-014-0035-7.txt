Abstract
We are overwhelmed and overloaded with the data deluge brought by the digital age. Hierarchies are pervasive cognitive patterns that allow us to reorganize data and reduce the dimensionality of the information space to manageable levels (e.g., filesystems and navigational menus). In spite of their widespread adoption, such hierarchies can be improved to cope with the present needs of data sharing and reuse. First, we seldom use mechanisms to evaluate how well they partition the information space. Second, we build static and content-driven hierarchies instead of dynamic and context-driven (i.e., task-driven) ones. Third, we use ad hoc and implicit hierarchization criteria, whereas they should be explicit and shareable. This paper discusses the problems related to the construction of hierarchies, and presents a conceptual framework to turn them into reconfigurable and shareable artifacts. Moreover, it explores how dynamically reconfigurable hierarchies can better cope with the multi-faceted nature of content, illustrating these principles through a tool that validates our proposal.
