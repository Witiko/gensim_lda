Abstract
For centuries, philosophers, policy-makers and urban planners have debated whether aesthetically
pleasing surroundings can improve our wellbeing.
To date,
quantifying how scenic an area is has
proved challenging,
due to the difficulty of
gathering large-scale measurements of
scenicness.
In
this study we ask whether images uploaded to the website Flickr,
combined with crowdsourced
geographic data from OpenStreetMap, can help us estimate how scenic people consider an area to
be.
We validate our findings using crowdsourced data from Scenic-Or-Not,
a website where users
rate the scenicness of
photos from all
around Great
Britain.
We find that
models including
crowdsourced data from Flickr
and OpenStreetMap can generate more accurate estimates of
scenicness
than models
that
consider
only basic census
measurements
such as
population
density or whether an area is urban or rural.
Our results provide evidence that by exploiting
the vast quantity of
data generated on the Internet,
scientists and policy-makers may be able to
develop a better understanding of
people’s subjective experience of
the environment in which
they live.

Introduction
Does living in picturesque areas improve people’s wellbeing? Philosophers,
psychologists,
urban planners and policy-makers have deliberated over this question for years,
but have
been hindered by the lack of data on the beauty of our environment. For many years, it has
been possible to obtain large-scale data sets on objective measures of the environment, such
as distances to parks or coastal
areas,
the proportion of green land cover and population
density. However, such measures do not reveal people’s subjective experience of either built
or natural environments.
While several
studies reveal
a connection between human wellbeing and greenspace (de

and Popham,
2007,
2008;
Sugiyama et
al.,
2010;
van den Berg et
al.,
2010;
White et
al.,
2013),
they also expose counterintuitive results.
For example,
Mitchell
and
Popham (2007)
suggest
that
ill
health
in
low-income
suburban
neighbourhoods
is
positively correlated with greater greenspace.
This surprising result may be due to the fact
that the greenspace was aesthetically displeasing and thus not amenable to physical activity
(Giles-Corti et al., 2005; Kaczynski et al., 2008; Sugiyama et al., 2010).
Traditionally, time consuming and costly large-scale surveys have been the only method
of eliciting information about the scenicness of an area. While more automated methods of
eliciting beauty of the environment using data from Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
are promising (Bishop and Hulse, 1994; Greˆ
t-Regamey et al., 2007; Palmer, 2004; Schirpke
et al., 2013), in the past these analyses have only been carried out on a small scale, possibly
due to a reliance on survey data to validate their ﬁndings.
Today, we have a new source of information on how humans perceive their environment:
the vast quantity of data uploaded to the Internet. Increasingly, this online activity is being
geographically tagged,
which has already lead to a range of fascinating insights into our
interactions with our surrounding environment (Batty,
2013;
Botta et al.,
2015;
Casalegno
et al.,
2013;

2015;

Tenerelli
et al.,
2016;
Vespignani,
2009;
Wood et al.,
2013; Zaltz Austwick et al., 2013). For instance, to investigate whether such data can help us
understand the relationship between aesthetics and human wellbeing, Seresinhe et al. (2015)
consider data from Scenic-Or-Not, a website that crowdsourced ratings of scenicness for 1
km grid squares of Great Britain.
Their analysis of these ratings reveals that residents of
more
scenic
environments
in England report
better
health,
even when taking
core
socioeconomic indicators
of
deprivation,
such as
income,
into account.
They ﬁnd that
such diﬀerences in reports of health can be better explained by the scenicness of the local
environment
than by measurements of
greenspace alone.
These results suggest
that
the
aesthetics
of
the environment
may have greater
practical
consequences
than previously
believed.
The volume of Scenic-Or-Not ratings is considerable:
to date,
over 1.5 million ratings
have been collected for over 200,000 locations in the UK.
However,
if it were possible to
measure scenicness on a global
scale,
what might this reveal
about wellbeing around the
world?
Photographs
uploaded to image sharing websites
such as
Flickr
cover
a much
greater area at
greater density.
Here,
we begin to investigate whether data from Flickr
could be used to estimate scenicness ratings for any location without the requirement of
gathering new Scenic-Or-Not ratings. Geotagged Flickr images have already been shown to
be of
value in identifying people’s preferences for speciﬁc places (Girardin et
al.,
2008;
Gliozzo et al.,
2016;
Tenerelli
et al.,
2016;
Wood et al.,
2013).
We envisage that we might
be able to capture the scenicness of
an area through Flickr data,
as people might
share
more photos of places they ﬁnd to be picturesque, or may reveal the scenicness of an area
through
descriptions
they
add
to
the
shared
image.
We
also
explore
data
from
OpenStreetMap,
an
editable
Wiki
world
map
created
by
thousands
of
volunteers
(Haklay,
2010;
Neis
and
Zipf,
2012),
from people
with
local
knowledge
to
GIS
professionals.
We ask whether images uploaded to Flickr,
combined with crowdsourced
geographic data on OpenStreetMap,
can help us determine which geographic areas people
consider to be scenic.
We build a base model
to estimate how scenic an area is using measures of population
density, number of residents, and urban, suburban or rural categories. We then explore to
568

what extent crowdsourced data from Flickr and OpenStreetMap can help improve our base
model.
We identify which crowdsourced variables can add power to our model
using a
statistical
learning
method.
Finally,
we
investigate
whether
models
including
crowdsourced variables can generate more accurate estimates of scenicness than our base
model comprising measurements of population and area category alone.
Data and methodology
Census and environment data
In our base model, we investigate whether data on population density, number of residents,
and urban, suburban or rural categories can be used to estimate scenicness.
Data on population density and number of residents have been extracted through the
2011 Census for England and Wales (Oﬃce for National
Statistics,
2012)
and Scotland’s
Census 2011 (National
Records of Scotland,
2012).
We conduct our analyses on the level
of Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs), which are deﬁned by the Oﬃce for National
Statistics for statistical
analyses.
LSOAs are geographic areas ranging from 0.018 to 684
square km, containing between 983 and 8,300 residents (1,500 on average).
We use data on urban and rural classiﬁcations of LSOAs (Oﬃce for National Statistics,
2013; Scottish Government, 2012) to explore the role urban, suburban or rural areas might
play in the scenicness of an area. For the purposes of this study, ‘urban’ LSOAs in England
and Wales are deﬁned using the category ‘Urban Major Conurbation’ (Oﬃce for National
Statistics, 2013). The remaining urban categories are deemed suburban. ‘Urban’ LSOAs in
Scotland are deﬁned using the category ‘Large Urban Areas’
and ‘suburban’
LSOAs are
deﬁned using the categories ‘Other Urban Areas’,
‘Accessible Small
Towns’,
and ‘Remote
Small Towns’ (Scottish Government, 2012).
Flickr and OpenStreetMap data
In our extended models,
we include measures derived from all
publicly available Flickr
photographs
uploaded in 2013 that
were geotagged as
being located in Great
Britain.
Data on Flickr images were retrieved from Flickr’s Application Programming Interface
(see
https://www.ﬂickr.com/services/api/ﬂickr.photos.search.html)
throughout
2014.
In
order to ensure that the photographs were taken outdoors,
we exclude images that were
taken in buildings using crowdsourced data from OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap data on
Buildings, Points of Interests and Natural Points of Interest were retrieved from GeoFabrik
(2016, http://www.geofabrik.de/) where data were last updated on 20 July 2016.
From the 3,549,000 Flickr images we have available for our analysis, we identify 427,727
images located inside buildings and exclude them from our analysis. However, it is possible
that the data from OpenStreetMap do not always correctly identify building locations. For
example, Haklay (2010) and Zielstra and Hochmair (2013) observe that the OpenStreetMap
road network data might
not
always be complete.
To gain further insight
into whether
photos
were taken in outdoor
locations,
we therefore test
a random sample of
10,000
images using the Places Convolutional
Neural
Network (CNN)
(Zhou et
al.,
2014).
The
Places CNN has been trained on around 2.5 million images to detect 205 scene categories,
which in turn can be classiﬁed as indoor categories or outdoor categories. The labels of the
top ﬁve predicted place categories can therefore be used to check if the given image has been
taken indoors or outdoors with more than 95% accuracy (Zhou et al.,
2014).
Using this
method, we ﬁnd that 23% of images classiﬁed as being outdoors using the OpenStreetMap
building data are classiﬁed as indoor images using Places CNN.
When we evaluate image
Seresinhe et al.
569
classiﬁcations in urban,
suburban and rural
areas separately,
we ﬁnd more mismatches
between the OpenStreetMap and Places CNN classiﬁcations in urban and suburban areas
than in rural
areas.
In urban areas,
35% of
images classiﬁed as outdoor images using
OpenStreetMap data are classiﬁed as being indoor images using Places CNN. In suburban
areas, the corresponding ﬁgure is 24%, in comparison to 14% in rural areas. We discuss the
potential implications of this classiﬁcation mismatch in ‘Discussion’ section.
Scenic-Or-Not data
We use data from Scenic-Or-Not to determine how accurately our model
using Flickr and
OpenStreetMap data is able to predict scenic areas. Scenic-Or-Not presents users with random
geotagged photographs of Great Britain,
which visitors can rate on an integer scale 1–10,
where 10 indicates ‘very scenic’
and 1 indicates ‘not
scenic’.
Each image,
sourced from
Geograph,
represents a 1 km grid square of
Great
Britain.
The Scenic-Or-Not
data set
comprises 217,000 images covering nearly 95% of the 1 km grid squares of Great Britain.
We retrieved data on scenicness ratings by accessing the Scenic-Or-Not website (http://scenic.
mysociety.org/) on 2 August 2014. The Scenic-Or-Not website uses photographs sourced from
Geograph (http://www.geograph.org.uk/). We only include images in our analysis that have
been rated more than three times. We then aggregate these ratings on the level of LSOA.
Identifying scenic images
When uploading images to Flickr,
photographers commonly choose to include additional
textual
data such as a title,
description and tags (e.g.
‘scenic’,
‘sky’,
‘city’) to describe the
image. We attempt to determine which images could be considered ‘scenic’ by evaluating this
textual
data associated with each Flickr photograph.
We deem a photograph as ‘scenic’
if
there is a mention of ‘scenic’ or a similar word in this textual metadata.
To determine which words we should consider as similar to scenic, we build a word2vec
model
(Radim and Petr,
2010,
Mikolov et al.,
2013). A word2vec model
is a model
that is
constructed by processing a large corpus of text,
in order to build a representation of the
semantic meaning of each word on the basis of the contexts in which it appears.
Here,
we
process the full
Wikipedia corpus,
using the latest data as of 14 July 2016 retrieved from
https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/.
Having constructed this model,
we are able to
query it in order to identify words that have a similar meaning to any word of interest, such
as ‘scenic’. We classify a word as being similar if the similarity between the words is more
than 0.5 according to the constructed word2vec model. We ﬁrst search for words similar to
‘scenic’,
for which three words are returned:
‘picturesque’,
‘scenery’
and ‘hiking’.
We then
search again for these three words to identify further similar words, where the model returns
words such as ‘birdwatching’, ‘landscape’ and ‘unspoilt’. Table 1 lists all the words identiﬁed
by this approach.
In order to identify images that
the textual
information suggests might
be scenic,
we
search the title,
description and tags,
using a regular expression for the word ‘scenic’
(e.g.
\bscenic\b)
and,
separately,
for
the
word ‘scenic’
or
words
similar
to ‘scenic’
(e.g.
\b(scenicWpicturesqueWbirdwatchingWlandscape)\b) The expression ‘\b’
allows us to search for
whole words only. In this process, we count only a single occurrence of ‘scenic’ (or a word
similar to ‘scenic’) even if it has ‘scenic’
(or a word similar to ‘scenic’) mentioned several
times in the metadata. We then have two diﬀerent measures for each image: (1) whether the
textual
data mentions ‘scenic’,
or (2) whether the textual
data mentions ‘scenic’
or a word
similar to ‘scenic’.

Estimating scenic areas
We build a base model
to help us determine how scenic an area is,
using the measures of
population density,
number
of
residents,
and whether
an area is
categorised as
urban,
suburban or rural.
When working with spatial
data,
it
is
reasonable
to assume
that
observations
in
neighbouring areas may be more or less alike simply due to their proximity,
and hence
may exhibit autocorrelation (Bivand et al.,
2013;
Harris et al.,
2005).
We conﬁrm this by
ﬁrst carrying out a Moran’s I test, which measures whether spatial autocorrelation is present
in the data.
Due to the spatial
autocorrelation revealed by this test (as reported in more
detail
below),
it
is not
appropriate to run a simple linear regression analysis,
as spatial
dependencies
would
exist
in the
error
term.
Hence,
we
run
our
analysis
using
a
conditional auto regressive (CAR) model as detailed below.
We then explore to what extent crowdsourced data from Flickr and OpenStreetMap can
help improve our base model. We identify which crowdsourced variables can add power to
our model using a statistical learning method as explained below.

returns
words
such as
‘birdwatching’,
‘landscape’
and ‘unspoilt’.
Table 2 lists all
words we identify with this approach.
Seresinhe et al.

Finally,
we investigate whether models including crowdsourced variables can generate
more accurate estimates of
scenicness than our base model
comprising measurements of
population and area category alone, by comparing the Akaike weights (AICw) of each model.
CAR model
Initially proposed by Besag and colleagues (Besag, 1974; Besag et al., 1991), the CAR model
captures spatial
dependence between neighbours through an adjacency matrix of the areal
units.
The CAR model quantiﬁes the spatial relationship in the data by including a conditional
distribution in the error term e
i
. The conditional distribution of e
i
is thus represented as

Using statistical
learning to identity candidate variables
We use the statistical learning method of cross-validation (Hastie et al., 2009; James et al.,
2013)
to identify
candidate
variables
to use
in our
scenic
estimation models
using
crowdsourced data.
We randomly partition the observations in our data set into a 60/40
split where 60% of the data are used as the training set and 40% of the data are used as the
validation set.
We ensure that
each partitioned data set
has
an equal
split
of
urban,
suburban,
and rural
areas.
We ﬁt
new models on the training data set
including all
the
variables
in our
base
model
(population density,
number
of
residents,
and urban,
suburban or rural categories) plus every combination of all the crowdsourced variables we
have identiﬁed, as listed in Table 2. We then ﬁt these models to estimate responses for the
observations on the validation set. We then compare the resulting validation test error rates,
as measured by Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE). We choose two candidate models for
estimating scenicness by choosing those with the lowest RMSEs.
Akaike weights
In order
to determine which model
best
estimates
scenicness,
we calculate the AICw,
following the method proposed by Wagenmakers and Farrell
(2004),
as the AIC values
themselves
are
challenging
to
interpret
on
their
own.
We
derive
AICws,
by
ﬁrst
identifying the model
with the lowest
AIC.
For each model,
we then calculate an AIC
diﬀerence,
by determining the diﬀerence between the lowest
AIC and the model’s AIC.
We next determine the relative likelihood of each model,
following the method described
in Wagenmakers and Farrell (2004). To calculate the AICws, we normalise these likelihoods,
such that across all models they sum to one. The resulting AICws can be interpreted as the
probability of each model given the data.
Results
A comparison of the quantity of Flickr photographs taken (Figure 1(a)) with a map of scenic
ratings of images from Scenic-Or-Not (Figure 1(b)) indicates that areas with a high density of
572
Environment and Planning B:
Urban Analytics and City Science 45(3)
photos – which tend to be highly populated areas such as London and Manchester – are
rated as being the least scenic. On the other hand, highly scenic areas, such as Scotland, have
a low density of Flickr photographs taken. This indicates that population density may be a
signiﬁcant factor for estimating the scenicness of an area.
This also leads us to suppose that whether an area is urban, suburban or rural may also
play a part in scenic ratings. Furthermore, Scotland, which is rated as highly scenic, is known
for its beautiful
rural
settings.
We therefore explore to what extent urban,
suburban and
rural areas aﬀect scenic ratings.
We build our ﬁrst model to determine how scenic an area is, drawing on these objective
measurements:
population density,
number
of
residents,
and urban,
suburban or
rural
categories.
As
noted in the Methods
section,
spatial
data may exhibit
autocorrelation,
where nearby observations may have similar values,
and thereby violate the assumption
made
in
linear
regression
that
observations
are
independent.
To
test
whether
autocorrelation exists,
we ﬁrst
build a linear regression model.
A Moran’s I test
on the
residuals of the linear regression model conﬁrms that the model exhibits signiﬁcant spatial
autocorrelation in the residuals (Moran’s I ¼ 0.127,
p < 0.001,
N ¼ 15,188).
We therefore
build a CAR model
(as described in ‘Methods’
section) that takes spatial
autocorrelation
into account (Bivand et al., 2013; Harris et al., 2005).
The results of the CAR model
analysis reveal
that low population density is associated
with areas of high scenicness (b ¼ 0.285, p < 0.001, N ¼ 15,188) and the lower the number
of residents in an LSOA, the greater the scenicness (b ¼ 0.0001, p < 0.001, N ¼ 15,188). We

Figure 1.
The relationship between Flickr photographs and ratings of
scenicness from Scenic-Or-Not in
Great Britain.
(a) We create a density plot of
all
Flickr photographs uploaded in 2013,
geotagged as being
taken in Great Britain.
In order to ensure that the photographs have been taken outdoors,
we exclude
images that were taken in buildings.
Buildings are identified using crowdsourced data from OpenStreetMap.
Inspection of
the map indicates that most images are taken in areas of
high population density such as
London and Manchester.
(b) The Scenic-Or-Not data set comprises 217,000 images,
sourced from Geograph,
covering nearly 95% of
the 1 km grid squares of
Great Britain.
We calculate the mean scenic rating of
all
Scenic-or-Not photographs at the level of English Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) and depict these
ratings using quantile breaks. Examination of the two maps indicates that while the major cities have a higher
density of photos, they are also rated as the least scenic. On the other hand, Scotland is rated as highly scenic
while the density of
photos remains low.
This suggests that population density needs to be taken into
account in the analysis.
(c) An individual
photographer may take several
photographs of an area.
While this
may reveal individual preferences, we are primarily interested in the collective perception of scenicness. We
therefore calculate the mean number of Flickr photographers for each LSOA and depict these ratings using
quantile breaks. Visual inspection of these maps reveals that measures of the number of Flickr photographers
per LSOA correspond well
with scenic ratings from Scenic-Or-Not.

Environment and Planning B:
Urban Analytics and City Science 45(3)
also ﬁnd that
urban and suburban areas are associated with reduced scenicness (urban
b ¼ 0.260 p < 0.001, N ¼ 15,188; suburban b ¼ 0.083, p < 0.001, N ¼ 15,188).
We now explore to what extent crowdsourced data from Flickr and OpenStreetMap can
add additional
explanatory power to our base model.
First,
we investigate whether the
quantity of geotagged images uploaded to Flickr may be a proxy for visual
preference of
an area. As we are interested in the perception of outdoor environments rather than indoor
environments,
we also use crowdsourced data from OpenStreetMap to determine where
buildings are located,
and use this data on to exclude Flickr images that have been taken
inside buildings.
We note factors that may aﬀect the quantity of Flickr images besides the scenicness of an
area, and take a number of steps to correct for these issues in our analysis. First of all, we
account for the fact that one photographer may take several photographs of an area. While
this may reveal individual preference for an area, this may not reveal collective preference for
an area. We therefore consider only the quantity of Flickr photographers for each LSOA, as
we are primarily interested in the collective perception of scenicness.
Next, we consider the various reasons for people taking Flickr photographs. For example,
people typically upload photographs to Flickr when they want to share a memory of an
event
or an activity such as a birthday party (Purves et
al.,
2011),
or they might
share
pictures
of
themselves
(commonly known as
‘selﬁes’).
People might
also add valuable
information related to a photograph if
they are motivated to share the image with the
wider public (Nov et al.,
2008).
We therefore attempt to mitigate the potential
biases in
the uploaded Flickr photographs, as well as identify a stronger signal of scenic images by the
following approaches: (1) we attempt to identify travel photographers and (2) we attempt to
identify scenic images.
We hypothesise that
Flickr photographs taken by photographers that travel
are more
likely to reveal scenic preferences. We therefore count the number of LSOAs in which each
Flickr
photographer
has taken photos.
We ﬁnd the mean number
of
LSOAs in which
someone has taken a photograph is eight.
We therefore deem a Flickr photographer a
‘travel photographer’ if they have taken photographs in more than eight LSOAs.
We also attempt
to identify which images are scenic using textual
data people have
added to describe the image,
as explained in more detail
in ‘Methods’
section.
We classify
an image as scenic if
there is a mention of
‘scenic’
or a word similar to ‘scenic’
in this
textual
metadata.
We
then count
the
number
of
images
classiﬁed as
scenic
for
each
LSOA.
We also include the count of images classiﬁed as scenic divided by all
the images
uploaded per LSOA, which gives us the proportion of images classiﬁed as scenic uploaded
per LSOA.
Finally, we correct for a variety of characteristics that may aﬀect the quantity of images
uploaded in each LSOA:
land area,
quantity of points of interest (POI) and quantity of
natural features. As LSOAs vary dramatically in size – between 1 hectare to 67,280 hectares
in our analysis – and people may take more pictures in larger LSOAs, we consider to which
extent hectares aﬀect the number of Flickr photographs taken.
Certain POI,
particularly
tourist attractions,
such as the London Eye,
Big Ben and Edinburgh Castle attract large
numbers of images (Antoniou et al., 2010). This could distort the signal of whether or not the
photographer considers the location scenic. We therefore consider how the quantity of POI
in each LSOA inﬂuence the number of Flickr photographs taken. OpenStreetMap also has
data on how many natural POI exist in each LSOA. As natural POI may be associated with
scenicness,
we also consider how many Flickr images are taken considering how many
natural POI occur in each LSOA.

We can now test whether models that include crowdsourced variables perform better than
a base model that only includes the objective measurements (population density, number of
residents,
and urban,
suburban or
rural
categories).
Table 2 lists
all
the crowdsourced
variables that we test.
Using a statistical learning approach (as speciﬁed in the Methods section), we identify two
candidate models
that
include crowdsourced data:
(1)
A simple Flickr
model
that,
in
addition to the base model,
includes the number of Flickr photographers in each LSOA
divided by the number of
POI in that
LSOA (variable:
photographers.POI);
and (2)
an
extended Flickr model
that,
in addition to the simple Flickr model,
includes the number
of images classiﬁed as scenic per LSOA (variable: photos.scenic.similar).
As in our previous analysis,
we build these two candidate Flickr CAR models.
In the
simple Flickr model,
we ﬁnd that a greater number of Flickr photographers,
adjusted by
POI,
is
signiﬁcantly associated with higher
ratings
of
scenicness
(b ¼ 0.095,
p < 0.001,
N ¼ 15,188).
In the extended Flickr model,
we also ﬁnd that
a greater number of
Flickr
photographers,
adjusted
by
POI,
is
signiﬁcantly
associated
with
higher
ratings
of
scenicness
(b ¼ 0.092,
p < 0.001,
N ¼ 15,188).
In addition,
we
ﬁnd that
the number
of
images with the word ‘scenic’
or a word similar to ‘scenic’
is signiﬁcantly associated with
higher ratings of scenicness (b ¼ 0.001, p < 0.001, N ¼ 15,188).
Finally,
in order to determine whether models including crowdsourced variables can
perform better
than the models
that
only include objective measurements,
we rank all
three models – the base model,
the simple Flickr model,
and the extended Flickr model
–
in terms of their Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. This provides a measure of the
model ﬁt given a set of data. In order to compare the ﬁt of the models to each other, AIC
values are transformed to AICw following the method proposed by Wagenmakers and
Farrell
(2004).
These weights can be interpreted as the probability of
each model
given
the data,
as
described in the ‘Methods’
section.
This
model
comparison indicates
that
models including crowdsourced geographic data from Flickr and OpenStreetMap provide
more accurate estimates of the scenicness of an area than models that only include objective
measurements such as population density and whether an area is urban, suburban or rural
(Table 3).
Using the most probable model, the extended Flickr model, we further investigate how the
ranked estimates of the scenicness of an area compare to the ranked actual measures of the
scenicness
of
an area in diﬀerent
settings
(Figure 2).
We ﬁnd that
our
model
is
most
successful
at
estimating the
scenicness
of
an area in rural
settings
(urban:
s ¼ 0.216,
p < 0.001,
N ¼ 1,060;
suburban:
s ¼ 0.225,
p < 0.001,
N ¼ 2,567;
rural:
s ¼ 0.363,
p < 0.001,
N ¼ 2,449, Kendall’s rank correlation).
Discussion
Our
ﬁndings
suggest
that
crowdsourced
data
from sources
such
as
Flickr
and
OpenStreetMap have the potential
to reveal
information about how people interact with
their environment.
Speciﬁcally,
we ﬁnd that models using crowdsourced data can generate
more accurate estimates of scenicness than models comprising only traditional statistics such
as population density or whether an area is urban or rural. Our results provide evidence that
measures of
images uploaded to Flickr do indeed contain information that
can inform
estimates of how scenic an area is.
However, while the improvement is signiﬁcant, the eﬀect size is not large. As our sample
analysis of 10,000 Flickr images indicated that around 23% of the images deemed as outdoor
images might in fact be indoor images, these might be adding uncertainty to our results.

Regression coefficients for CAR models estimating scenic ratings based on the validation data set (*p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001). The set of observations are randomly partitioned into a 60/40 split, where 60% of the data are used as the
training set and 40% as the validation set.
Each partitioned data set has an equal
split of urban,
suburban and rural
areas.
The analysis is carried out at the level
of Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs).
The simple Flickr model
includes an
additional
variable:
the number of
images taken by unique photographers divided by the number of
points of
interest
(photographers.POI).
The extended Flickr model
includes a further additional
variable:
the number of
images with the
word ‘scenic’
or word similar to ‘scenic’
per LSOA (photos.scenic.similar).
Here,
we present the results of evaluating the
models on the entire data set.
In order to determine which model
offers the best estimation power,
we rank all
three in
terms of their AIC values. In order to compare the fit of the models to each other, AIC values are transformed to Akaike
weights (AICw) following the method proposed by Wagenmakers and Farrell
(2004).
We find that the extended Flickr
model
with the additional
crowdsourced geographic variables has the greatest estimation power.
These results provide
evidence that models including crowdsourced data have greater power to estimate the scenicness of
an area.

Ranked estimated scenic ratings versus ranked actual

Estimated scenic ratings are generated on a test data set using the best Flickr
model. The set of observations is randomly partitioned into a 60/40 split, where 60% of the data are used as
the training set and 40% as the validation set. The models are fit using the training data set, and the best Flickr
model is chosen based on the estimations on the validation data set. Estimated and actual ratings are ranked
and rescaled such that the lowest rank (most scenic area) is given the value 0,
and the highest rank (least
scenic area) is given the value 1. Rescaled ranks are then plotted using a 2D kernel density estimation. Visual
analysis and a statistical
analysis of the correlation between these ranks suggests that our model
generates
better estimates of
the ranking of
scenic ratings in rural
areas than in suburban and urban areas (urban:

We found no evidence in support of our hypothesis that travel photographers would give
us a useful metric of the scenicness of an area. Visual analysis of the photographs uploaded
by the most proliﬁc Flickr travel
photographers reveals that many of them use Flickr for
curated content such as bus and train spotting (an observation also reported by Gliozzo
et al.,
2016).
If the primary motivation of many of the photographers on Flickr is only to
post content on a particular subject, then this would distort the estimate that Flickr data may
provide of the scenicness of an area.
We aim to mitigate this eﬀect by only including images that we identify as being related to
scenicness
through our analysis
of
textual
data associated with each image.
While this
approach improves our results,
the overall
impact
from this approach still
is not
strong
enough to dramatically improve our scenicness estimates.
Finally, we consider why the performance of our analysis is worse in urban and suburban
areas.
Our analysis focuses on images with locations that OpenStreetMap data indicated
have been taken outside buildings. However, we ﬁnd that a neural network trained to extract
information from images of outdoor and indoor environments,
Places CNN (Zhou et al.,
2014),
produces
diﬀerent
classiﬁcations
for
some
of
these
images.
Speciﬁcally,
when
analysing a sample of 10,000 images classiﬁed as outdoor using OpenStreetMap data,
we
ﬁnd that Places CNN classiﬁes 35% of the images taken in urban areas and 24% of the
images taken in suburban areas as indoor images.
In rural
areas,
only 14% of the images
classiﬁed as outdoor images using OpenStreetMap data are classiﬁed as indoor images with
Places CNN.
We suggest that higher building density in urban and suburban areas may
mean that higher location accuracy is required to avoid misclassiﬁcation between indoor and
outdoor locations, such that a greater proportion of misclassiﬁcations is to be expected. This
problem is likely to be exacerbated due to reduced functionality of GPS location technology
in built-up areas. OpenStreetMap data can also suﬀer from lack of positional accuracy and
lack of completeness (Haklay,
2010;
Zielstra and Hochmair,
2013).
Urban and suburban
areas may be more likely to have buildings that have yet to be added to the OpenStreetMap
buildings
data.
Our
OpenStreetMap data on POI
may also contain a great
deal
of
uncertainty,
particularly in urban and suburban areas
where there are likely to be a
greater number of
POI and thus a higher chance of
inaccuracies.
Furthermore,
we note
that
Scenic-Or-Not
ratings are provided on a 1 km grid square basis.
At
the same time
urban and suburban LSOAs
are likely to be smaller
than rural
LSOAs:
rural
LSOAs
range from 2 to 67,280 hectares;
suburban LSOAs range from 4 to 5,362 hectares;
and
urban LSOAs range from 1 to 4,804 hectares. Information on the scenicness of urban and
suburban areas may therefore be lower in quality,
due to a lower number of
scenicness
ratings per LSOA.
Conclusion
We investigate whether the vast quantity of data uploaded to the Internet could help us
identify which areas of Great Britain people consider to be scenic.
We analyse data from
geotagged images uploaded to Flickr,
combined with crowdsourced geographic data from
OpenStreetMap, in order to see if such data can provide improvements of scenic estimations.
We validate our ﬁndings using the website Scenic-Or-Not,
which crowdsources ratings of
scenicness in Great Britain.
We ﬁnd that models including crowdsourced geographic data
from Flickr and OpenStreetMap do provide more accurate estimates of the scenicness of an
area than models using objective geographical data alone, although the improvement is only
modest.
Using a statistical
learning approach,
we identify the following crowdsourced
variables as those that
most
improve estimates of
scenicness:
(1)
the quantity of
unique
578
Environment and Planning B:

Flickr
photographers,
taking into account
the
number
of
POI
(as
obtained through
OpenStreetMap data) in each LSOA and (2) the number of images with the word ‘scenic’
or a word similar to ‘scenic’ per LSOA.
We also ﬁnd that models drawing on data from Flickr and OpenStreetMap produce more
accurate estimates of scenicness in rural neighbourhoods than in urban and suburban areas.
This may be due to the plurality of reasons for which people upload photographs in urban
and suburban neighbourhoods:
for instance,
creating a memory of
an event
such as a
birthday party or a sporting event. Urban and suburban LSOAs are also likely to contain
a greater number of unidentiﬁed indoor images in our analysis as such areas are more likely
to contain buildings that may either be missing from the OpenStreetMap data or for which
the OpenStreetMap data is positionally inaccurate. Similarly, functionality of GPS location
technology used to locate photographs is likely to be reduced in urban and suburban areas.
Finally,
our urban and suburban scenic ratings may be less accurate than those in rural
areas, due to the presence of smaller LSOAs which contain fewer Scenic-Or-Not images in
urban and suburban areas. Further research will need to be conducted in order to mitigate
these factors.
Nonetheless, analysis of crowdsourced data does seem to provide valuable information on
how people perceive their everyday environments. Our results suggest that by exploiting data
gathered from our everyday interactions with the Internet, scientists and policy-makers alike
may be able to develop a better understanding of
people’s subjective experience of
the
environment in which they live.
