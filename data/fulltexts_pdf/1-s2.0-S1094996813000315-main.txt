Abstract
When groups of consumers share information or express their opinions about products and services, their attitudes or behavior sometime align
without centralized coordination, a phenomenon known as herding. Building on pattern-based explanations of herding from the cognitive science
literature, we propose a framework to elucidate herding behavior based on three dimensions: the speed of contagion, i.e., the extent to which the
behavior spreads in a given time, the number of individuals, i.e., the proportion of the whole population expressing the behavior, and the uniformity
of direction, i.e., the extent to which the mass behavior is increasingly uniform with one variant becoming dominant. Based on these dimensions,
we differentiate eight patterns of herding behavior from slowly diffusing, small and disparate groups through to rapidly spreading, massive herds
expressing a convergent behavior.
We explore these herding patterns in an online setting,
measuring their prevalence using over four thousand
streams of data from the online micro-blogging application, Twitter. We ﬁnd that all eight patterns occur in the empirical data set although some
patterns are rare,
particularly those where a convergent
behavior rapidly spreads through the population.
Importantly,
those occurrences that
develop into the pattern we call “stampeding,” i.e., the rapid spread of a dominant opinion expressed by many people, generally follow a consistent
development
path.
The proposed framework can help managers to identify such noteworthy herds in real
time,
and represents a ﬁrst
step in
anticipating this form of group behavior.

Introduction
This paper
explores dynamic patterns of
mass consumer
behavior,
leading to the phenomenon known as “herding.” In
this paper, we will focus in particular on herding behavior via
online media.
A better understanding of online herding is needed if we are
to understand the
link between widespread online opinion
formation and marketing outcomes, such as sales or reactions to
promotion campaigns. Obviously, not all herding in the online
setting is positive for firms,
with a classic example being the
bank run (Gu 2011). In 2008, there was a run on the Icelandic
bank,
Landsbanki,
which had offered high interest
online
savings accounts in the UK and The Netherlands under
the
brand, IceSave. Rumors quickly circulated online that the bank
had run into financial
difficulty and the speed with which
online withdrawals were made prompted the Icelandic govern-
ment to step in to save the nation's banking system.
This paper has two objectives: first, to design a framework to
distinguish between different
patterns
of
herding behavior;
second,
to assess which of these patterns can be witnessed in
practice
using a
large
database
of
online
behavior,
and to
investigate the dynamics of the development of large herds. For
example,
does
a particular
sequence of
patterns
indicate an
impending rush of consumer sentiment or behavior? In short, we
propose a framework to distinguish between different patterns of
mass behavior and identify these patterns using online data.
There is as yet
no accepted way of scientifically assessing
whether
a change in the pattern of
online mass behavior
is
important.
One change may prove to be insignificant whereas
another may lead to a sudden explosion of consumer reactions.

Hype cycles can be assessed by tracking the number of news
items regarding a specific topic,
for example,
but
the resulting
pattern with peaks in news items over time is usually erratic and
hard to diagnose (Jun 2012). Despite the availability of real-time,
online data,
there is a lack of
well-grounded instruments for
modeling changes in mass consumer attitude and behavior.
Besides this scientific motivation,
this study is also clearly
relevant
to managers.
Current
marketing practice is to track
certain characteristics
of
mass
consumer
behavior,
without
combining individual
indicators in a coherent
framework as a
basis for efficient
intervention.
Firms are able to measure the
number
of
page
views
of
a
new campaign,
the
prevailing
sentiment
in an online discussion,
and they can see when a
relevant topic is trending on Twitter. However, it is important to
know which metrics to follow simultaneously, and to be able to
identify different
patterns of
mass behavior
so that
irrelevant
noise can be confidently ignored and time and energy can be
devoted to situations which signify noteworthy developments.
Consumer
complaints
can occasionally lead to considerable
reputational damage, although firms may overreact if they devote
too much attention to every minor complaint. The compliments
of satisfied customers can influence others and lead to a boost in
sales for the company's products, but when and how can a firm
make use of such positive comments? A major task for sales and
communication managers is to monitor, predict and influence this
kind of mass consumer reaction and this paper goes some way to
offering an alternative approach based on patterns of herding
behavior. Once the patterns are understood and can be followed,
further
research can investigate the consequences of
different
marketing actions on how the herd changes from one pattern into
another. Interesting marketing information is provided not just by
the current
herding pattern,
but
also by transitions
between
patterns.
Marketers
are also increasingly adapting promotion
campaigns day-by-day, depending on consumers' reactions. It is
not
uncommon for
a brand campaign to launch two slightly
different versions of a campaign to test which version works best.
By adding data
about
changes
in herding patterns
to this
approach, marketers can not only adapt the campaign based on
individual reactions or click-through rates, but also on effects on
herding transitions.
Campaigns
can then be
seen as
being
successful
if they bring the herd into a more desirable pattern.
Many companies install web teams to track online communica-
tion around their products and services and to intervene when
possible. Our approach of tracking pattern transitions adds to this
strategy by allowing managers to state and track the goal
of
a campaign more precisely.
We return to this
point
in the
discussion,
to examine how our framework of herding patterns
can be applied by marketing managers.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First we relate
this study to relevant literature and describe the basis on which
we build.
We then propose a conceptual
framework of three
dimensions along which changes in mass consumer behavior
are important,
leading to eight
different
herding patterns.
Following that,
we
describe
a
method for
assessing the
prevalence
and dynamics
of
these
patterns
in the
online
setting, using empirical data from Twitter. We conclude with a
discussion of theoretical and managerial implications and we
address
limitations
of
this
study and propose avenues
for
further research.
Related Literature
Herding from a Marketing Perspective
There is a lack of clarity in the literature about what the term
“herding” means from a marketing perspective.
In an early
paper on this subject, Banerjee (1992) shows herding behavior
in a population of
hypothetical
agents
who make choices
between assets based on their own information and also on the
observed behavior of other agents. Following this, Bikhchandani,
Hirshleifer,
and Welch (1998) assess convergent
behavior that
does not
follow principles of traditional
economic models and
postulate that informational cascades, sanctions against defectors,
network externalities, and preference effects combine to produce
herding. These studies do not formally define herding but see it as
a phenomenon through which people tend to converge on similar
behavior,
resulting in a situation with “everyone doing what
everyone else is doing” (Banerjee 1992,
p 798).
However,
this
may be an oversimplified definition as
it
suggests
that
if
a
proportion of a population expresses the same behavior, it cannot
be called a herd. It may be more useful for marketers to define
herding as a process whereby a herd can develop in size and
possibly in other ways too.
Despite the subsequent attention to
herding in the marketing literature,
a formal
definition has not
emerged.
Looking
to
the
cognitive
science
literature,
we
find
a
definition which suits our
purpose of
describing the patterns
and dynamics of herding behavior. Following Rafaat, Chater, and
Frith (2009,
p 420) we see herding as “a form of convergent
social behavior that can be broadly defined as the alignment of
the thoughts or behaviors of individuals in a group (herd) through
local
interaction and without
centralized coordination.” These
authors present an overview of approaches that addresses herding
in humans and they distinguish between two main types of
research. Pattern-based explanations of herding behavior assume
that individuals can be modeled (often mathematically) as simple
decision-making units
and that
the patterns
of
relationships
between people are dominant in forming group behavior (Cucker
and Smale 2007;
Dyer et
al.
2008).
In contrast,
transmission-
based explanations
assume
that
the
complex intra-personal
cognitive mechanisms play a major role in the mental processes
that govern how people receive and process information and then
transfer it to others (Frith and Frith 2006). In this paper we build
on the first
of
these,
pattern-based explanations
of
herding
behavior.
Comparing Herding to Diffusion, Influence and Contagion
During the last
few decades,
marketing scholars have in-
vestigated mass consumer behavior using a number of related
concepts. Besides herding, various studies investigate processes
of diffusion,
influence and contagion and it may therefore aid
the reader to consider the similarities and differences between
these terms so as to understand the potential that herding has for
17
D.J. Langley et al. / Journal of Interactive Marketing 28 (2014) 16–25
predicting influential mass behavior (see Table 1).
Diffusion is
a term stemming from the physical sciences which, when used in
a marketing context,
describes the spread of
a product
or
a
product-related behavior via communication channels through a
social
system (Bass 1969;
Peres,
Muller,
and Mahajan 2010;
Rogers 2003).
The terms diffusion and herding both adopt
a
population-level
view of mass behavior,
although diffusion is
focused on the product or product-related behavior that spreads
through a population and herding is focused on the group itself.
Influence, or social influence, occurs when a person's attitude or
behavior is changed due to what other people say or do (Bonfield
1974).
According to Cialdini
(2008),
influence occurs through
six mechanisms: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social
proof,
authority,
liking,
and scarcity.
Contagion,
or
social
contagion,
is similar
to influence but
adopts the metaphor
of
viral infection such that the focus is on the behavior that makes
use of
people to propagate itself
(Du and Kamakura,
2011;
Langley et al. 2012). Influence and contagion are two processes
with the focus at the individual level.
In contrast to the concepts described above, we take Herding
to
be
the
group
process
through
which
a
population
of
consumers develops whereby behavior
becomes unified,
the
number of people expressing the behavior grows, and changes
spread rapidly through the herd.
Herding in the Online Setting
Although the process of herding is conceptually independent
of the medium in which the herd members interact, in practical
terms
there
are
significant
differences
between
traditional
(offline) herding and herding in the online setting.
According
to Barry and Fulmer (2004),
three important
attributes of the
online setting are social
bandwidth,
interactivity,
and surveil-
lance and we propose that these are relevant to herding as they
change the way that
people interact
and influence each other.
Social bandwidth, which refers to the transmission of socially-
relevant
information via the online medium,
will
affect
the
process of herding by providing social
identity cues through
which individuals can assess their
similarity to others in the
herd.
The types of social
identity cues made available online
may be far more limited than when meeting others face-to-face
but the cues may be highly relevant to the situation at hand, for
example in an online community devoted to a specific topic.
Interactivity may also play a role in herding in the online
setting, as the exchange of information between (potential) herd
members is quite different
to offline interactivity.
Individuals
can interact
with a wide range of
others both real-time and
asynchronously and many-to-many discussions between very
large numbers of people is possible. Surveillance, which refers
to the publicly observable nature of much online information,
may also alter
the way that
herding behavior
develops.
If
a
small,
developing herd makes
its
intentions
visible via an
online
application or
Web site
then many other
potential
members can see what is happening and follow developments,
as onlookers, without the need for the intervention of traditional
media.
Taken together,
these distinctive attributes of
online
social
media represent
a foundation for
a change in herding
dynamics.
Patterns of Herding and its Consequences
Herding has
been shown to occur
in marketing-relevant
behavior, such as product adoption (Hanson and Putler 1996),
financial
investments (Zhang and Liu 2012)
and community
membership (Oh and Jeon 2007). Herding in the online setting
has received research attention in the marketing and broader
management
literature and various studies have concentrated
on the effect
that
the perceived popularity of product
choices
has
on the
likelihood of
herding behavior
occurring.
For
example,
Hanson and Putler (1996) show that consumers who
download public domain and shareware software are highly
influenced by the number of previous downloads of a particular
program.
Herding behavior develops whereby one of a pair of
similar programs quickly becomes the market
leader and this
effect
can be brought
about
by artificially manipulating the
apparent number of downloads, thereby changing the perceived
popularity.
Similarly,
consumers are shown to influence each
other
when
downloading
music
from a
web
application
(Salganik,
Dodds,
and Watts 2006).
By comparing conditions
where
individuals
download songs
after
listening to them
versus
where individuals
also see the download choices
of
others, these authors show that social influence can drive online
herding behavior and they also show that this herding produces
apparently unpredictable outcomes in terms of
which songs

assess
online
herding
with
wedding
service
Web
sites,
specifically focusing on the impact
of popularity information
on niche versus broad-appeal
vendors.
Their findings suggest
that
individuals
in the herd derive quality information from
popularity information: when popularity information for a niche
vendor
is
artificially increased,
it
disproportionally increases
herding.
In another online product choice setting,
Chen,
Wang,
and Xie (2011) investigate two social influence drivers of online
herding on the book seller
Web site,
Amazon.com,
namely
word-of-mouth and observational learning. They find that herding
occurs but that the two drivers have opposite asymmetric effects:
negative
word-of-mouth
is
stronger
than
positive,
whereas
positive observational learning is stronger than negative.
Herding is also shown to occur in online community mem-
bership where different
social
network structures can produce
different
effects.
Oh and Jeon (2007) investigate different
con-
ditions on herding behavior for project membership in two open
source software communities
and they find that
membership
herding is particularly strong in large, scale-free network structures,
such as those found on the Internet.
Recently,
attention has been paid to herding behavior when
bids are made in online auctions. Simonsohn and Ariely (2008)
show that
people bidding for
products on the online auction
Web site eBay often observe others' decisions before deciding
themselves.
They find that
herding comes about
as initial
bids
attracted to low starting price auctions cause other
bidders to
congregate, thereby increasing competition and actually resulting
in higher prices being paid. Herzenstein, Dholakia, and Andrews
(2011) show that on the online lending Web site, Prosper, lenders
also exhibit herding behavior, although unlike on eBay, it appears
to be beneficial to join the herd. Specifically, they find that the
loan auctions that
start
to attract
lenders bring about
herding
whereby more lenders make bids until the loan is fully funded. In
an exploratory analysis they also show that two years on, the loan
auctions which attracted more herding (i.e.
more lending bids,
more quickly)
were more likely to be paid back on time,
indicating that the process of herding may somehow make use of
information regarding the trustworthiness of borrowers.
Zhang
and Liu (2012)
also investigate
lender
herding on Prosper
and disentangle two herding mechanisms:
irrational
(simple
mimicking of other lenders) versus rational (active observational
learning). They find that lenders engage in rational herding while
making various inferences about why other lenders are attracted
to auctions.
Again,
they show that
herding is associated with
fewer
loan defaults,
whereby rational
herding has a stronger
effect on loans subsequently being paid back.
In these studies, herding is measured as many people down-
loading the same song (Salganik,
Dodds,
and Watts 2006),
joining the same open source software project
(Oh and Jeon
2007), or offering loans (e.g. Zhang and Liu 2012). No account
is taken of different patterns of herding, such as different herd
sizes
or
herds
that
grow more
quickly
than
others.
To
understand herding so that a firm is able to react, in real-time,
to the
development
of
a
herd,
we
conclude
that
there
is
insufficient scientific insight into patterns of herding and how
these patterns
develop through time.
Added to this,
extant
literature focuses on herding situations with a binary behavioral
choice,
such as lend/do not
lend,
buy/do not
buy.
In many
situations related to products and brands it
is interesting to
understand how opinions in herds develop;
for
example,
is
there
a
growing consensus
or
is
there
a
fragmentation of
different factions?
It
is too simple to imagine that
there are only two herding
states:
that
a herd either acts as one or the individuals all
act
independently of each other. So far there has been no assessment
of progression in the development of herds, or analysis of various
patterns emerging from different examples of widespread group
behavior. This paper proposes such a set of herding patterns, tests
empirically whether
these patterns actually come about
in an
online setting and investigates the dynamic transitions between
herding patterns.
Patterns of Herding Behavior
Herding as described in the introduction can be succinctly
characterized as mass alignment without central coordination.
We study mass consumer behavior, such as buying a product
or
posting a message online.
The herd consists of
all
con-
sumers showing this behavior. Within this herd there can still
be some variation in the behavior. For instance, if the behavior
is buying music,
the variation is in the different
songs users
buy.
In order to study, model, understand and ultimately influence
herding we now present
a conceptual
framework of patterns of
herding behavior. Inspired by the pattern-based approach described
above from the cognitive science literature (Rafaat,
Chater,
and
Frith 2009),
we propose three dimensions
along which mass
behavior can be described:
1.
Speed of contagion: how fast is the behavior spreading? Do
all consumers start displaying the behavior at once, or does
the behavior slowly diffuse? Using a biological analogy, the
process is slow when a few animals in a herd start moving
and gradually more and more animals also start
moving,
until in the end the whole herd is on the move. The process
is fast
when a herd is frightened by a gunshot
and starts
moving all at once. In the same way a Twitter discussion on
a particular topic can carry on slowly or can explode when
something shocking rapidly spreads.
2.
Number of
individuals:
the proportion of
the whole pop-
ulation expressing the behavior or expressing an opinion on
the topic.
The magnitude is large when a relatively large
number of individuals expresses the behavior and it is small
when only a relatively small number of individuals from the
population does so. In the Twitter example, the magnitude is
large when a relatively large amount of people take part in a
discussion and it is small when only a few people take part
in a discussion.
3.
Uniformity
of
direction:
the
extent
to which the
mass
behavior
is increasingly uniform with one variant
of
the
behavior
becoming increasingly dominant.
For
example,
suppose there are two types of behavior, A and B. The herd
is directed if A is consistently growing at the expense of B.
19
D.J. Langley et al. / Journal of Interactive Marketing 28 (2014) 16–25
At one end of the spectrum (highly directed, or uniform) the
whole herd moves
as
one and at
the other
end (highly
undirected,
or
diverse)
there is apparent
chaos where all
actors move individually. The Twitter discussion can either
lead to a widespread consensus or there can be all kinds of
different opinions.
The eight herding patterns can be described by their position
on the three dimensions, above. In Table 2, examples are given of
how each pattern would come about on the online application,
Twitter. It can be seen that some of the patterns are not what we
would normally consider to be herding, such as when the group
size is small
or when there is no aligned direction.
Intuitively,
people associate herding with the stampede pattern: a large group
moving in the same direction, fast. We argue that it is of critical
importance to understand patterns that lead to classical stampede
herding and to be able to react
in an appropriate and timely
manner. Therefore, we include such ‘non-herding’ patterns in the
herding framework in order to provide a full picture of patterns of
mass behavior
and to help marketers to be able to track the
development of a herd through these ‘low herding’ patterns so
that they are not surprised by a sudden, massive and aligned herd.
In this explorative study we define the following research
questions. Do these herding patterns occur in practice? Is there
a basic pattern that
always
occurs
at
the onset
of
herding
behavior in the online setting? Is there a relationship between
patterns, such as a regular transition of one pattern into another?
In the next paragraphs we describe a method for assessing the
prevalence
and dynamics
of
the
described patterns,
using
empirical
data from the online micro-blogging application,
Twitter.
Empirical Analysis in an Online Setting
In this section we attempt
to find herding patterns in data
from the online social networking and microblogging applica-
tion, Twitter. Released in 2006, Twitter allows users to post and
read small text-based messages of up to 140 characters, called
‘tweets’.
It
has become one of
the most
successful
Internet
applications and as of June 2013 it is ranked 12th as measured
by the Alexa Traffic Rank,
which is a measure of
activity
relative to all Internet sites during the most recent three months,
combining the average daily unique visitors to a site and the
number
of
page views
on the site.
Twitter
is
relevant
for
researchers, marketers and other business domains as it reflects
real
time
consumer
opinion about
firm-related and brand-
related matters (Fischer and Reuber 2011; Jansen et al. 2009).
Added to this,
tweets can have real
effects on marketplace
outcomes (Bollen,
Mao,
and Zeng 2011).
The behavior
we
study is
tweeting using a given hashtag.
Twitter
users
can
include a hashtag in their tweets to signal that they are tweeting
about
a certain topic.
For instance,
they can use the hashtag
#nowplaying if
they are
discussing which music
they are
listening to at
that
moment.
Of
course,
there
can still
be
variation in the subtopics discussed under a hashtag. Hashtags
are
a
natural
way to delimit
herds,
because
people
using
hashtags choose to be part of the community of people tweeting
on a
topic.
Our
data
set
consists
of
“streams”
of
tweets
consisting of all tweets containing a unique hashtag in a certain
period.
We first
define measures
for
the three dimensions,
number of individuals,
speed of contagion,
and uniformity of
direction and analyze how these measures behave on a data set
of 4,622 streams of tweets containing a certain hashtag.
We
classify each time period of each stream into one of the herding
patterns.
We then investigate which patterns,
and transitions
between patterns, arise in the data.
Data Collection
The streams
of
tweets
were collected through Twitter's
public application programming interfaces
(APIs).
For
each
hashtag we downloaded all tweets containing the hashtag that
were available through the Twitter REST API. We defined this
data set as the stream attached to this hashtag. The REST API
can retrieve tweets from the last 6–9 days containing a search
term up to a maximum of 1,400 tweets. Consequently, streams
can have different
durations,
if more than 1,400 tweets were

have chosen the following measures for the three dimensions:
Number of individuals
total number of participants in a stream;
Speed of contagion number of tweets per hour in a stream;
Uniformity of direction the convergence of subtopics in a stream.
For speed of contagion, we follow Asur et al. (2011) and use
the number of tweets per hour as the measure for how fast the
discussion is moving. For magnitude, we take the total number of
people posting tweets with each hashtag as a way of representing
the mass nature of each herd. The number of subtopics within the
tweets using a hashtag says something about
the direction or
convergence of the opinions within the herd, and the way that we
measure direction is more complex as it
is a measure of
the
content
within the tweets.
To do this,
we clustered the tweets
containing the
same
hashtag into subtopics
and calculated
subtopic distribution using a technique called Latent
Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), which is similar to latent class analysis (Blei,
Ng, and Jordan 2003) and has been applied to Twitter (Ramage,
Dumais,
and Liebling 2010;
Weng et
al.
2010).
We used the
implementation of LDA in the Gensim package (Řehůřek and
Sojka 2010).
LDA determines groups of words that frequently
occur together, called subtopics, and the chance that each tweet
belongs to a subtopic. Using these probabilities we can calculate
the distribution of subtopics. We then determined the Kullback
and Leibler (1951) divergence for these subtopics:
D ¼
X
p
i
log
p
i
q
i
 
where p
i
are the probabilities in the distribution per hour and q
i
are the probabilities in the cumulative distribution for all previous
hours.
The Kullback–Leibler divergence is a measure for how
predictable the tweets
in the current
hour
are based on the
previous hours.
The correlations between measures for the three dimensions
are low (.33 between those for number of individuals and speed
of
contagion,
− .21 between those for
number
of
individuals
and uniformity of direction), except for the correlation between
speed of contagion and uniformity of direction (− .81) which is
as expected; generally,
the faster a topic spreads from person-
to-person,
the less directed or less predictable the tweets are.
However, it is the rare events when a mass of people develop a
united opinion that
are
of
particular
interest
to scientists,
managers and policy makers. The frequency of herding patterns
in the data is as shown in Table 3.
All eight of the herding patterns proposed in the conceptual
framework are found to occur in the data set. Slow meandering
is the most
frequent
pattern,
because all
hours in which no
tweets are posted fall under this pattern (33% of all hours in our
data set). Given that our data set excluded streams with fewer
than 200 tweets in eight hours, the true total of this pattern will
be much higher.
However,
most
streams
begin in the Fast
meandering pattern or
even in the
Hot
Brownian pattern,
showing how quickly Twitter streams can develop.
To illustrate the choice of measures we look at one example
stream: all tweets containing the hashtag #beliebershelpbeliebers.
Fans of the teenage idol Justin Bieber use this hashtag to ask each
other
for
help (e.g.,
to find more followers
or
to make a
Bieber-related topic trending).
As described above,
the unifor-
mity of direction dimension measures the distribution of tweets
over
the different
subtopics in the stream.
The subtopics are
determined by LDA,
by clustering tweets based on the words
they have in common. The ten subtopics for this stream are listed
in Table 4. Initially, the first subtopic was most common but there
was a wide diversity of other subtopics in the stream. As the herd
grew,
the uniformity of
direction remained low and the herd
developed from Fast meandering to Hot Brownian. At a certain
point, the second subtopic became very popular and the tweets
converged on this while the other subtopics diminished, resulting
in a uniform direction whereby the stampeding pattern emerged.
For each stream we measured the sequence of herding patterns
in consecutive periods.
The empirical
transition probabilities
between the patterns in such sequences are as shown in Table 5.
It is interesting to notice that for five patterns (Slow and Fast
meandering, Slow converging, Hot Brownian and Marching), the
transition probabilities indicate that it is most likely that the same
pattern will also occur in the next period. One might say that these
patterns are stable over time. The transition probabilities indicate
that
the Slow meandering pattern is the most
stable over time
(with a transition probability to itself of 91.9%). In contrast, three
patterns are inherently unstable (Fast converging, Cold Brownian
and Stampeding) because the transition probabilities indicate that

it is less likely that the same pattern will also occur in the next
period. A Cold Brownian pattern, for example, is most likely to
move into a Marching pattern (47.7%) in the next period. These
three patterns indicate that
the herd is in a state of transition.
Because
our
measure
for
magnitude,
the
total
number
of
participants, can only increase, there can be no transitions from
the group patterns (Cold and Hot Brownian Motion,
Marching
and Stampeding) towards the individual
patterns (Meandering
and Converging).
This is a limitation of the current implemen-
tation.
All
other
transitions
can occur.
Importantly,
streams
usually progress from the individual patterns to the group patterns
via one of the fast individual patterns: Fast meandering or Fast
converging.
Streams can go directly from Fast
converging to
Stampeding. But if they are in Fast meandering they are vastly
more likely to first go through Hot Brownian (see Fig. 2). This
means that
streams that
end up Stampeding typically follow a
standard dynamic: they increase first on the speed of contagion
dimension, then increase on the number of individuals dimension
before
finally becoming more
uniformly directed.
It
is
of
scientific
and
practical
importance
to
further
study
such
progressions so that we are able to reliably predict when a topic
will represent an important mass behavior or opinion.
Discussion
In this
paper,
we take the first
steps
in forming a basic
structured framework for distinguishing between different types
of herding. Different cases of herding have different characteris-
tics; some spread more quickly, some reach more people and in
some a consensus emerges.
Some of these characteristics may
make one herd important for firms or governments whereas others
require less attention. The first objective of this paper is to propose
a framework, based on the pattern-based explanation of herding
from the cognitive science literature,
by which we can identify

different
patterns of mass behavior.
We describe a conceptual
framework whereby eight different patterns can be distinguished
based on three dimensions: the number of individuals expressing
a behavior,
the speed of
contagion with which the behavior
spreads through a population, and whether there is a uniformity of
direction to the behavior.
The eight
resulting herding patterns
cover
a wide variety of
herding types from small,
indistinct
clusters through to rapid, large-scale and united crowds.
Our
second objective
is
to test
the
applicability of
the
framework, by assessing which of these patterns can be witnessed
in practice using a large database of online behavior taken from
the popular
micro-blogging Internet
application,
Twitter.
We
explore different possible metrics for each of the dimensions and
then measure the position of streams of tweets on each dimension.
From this, we are able to identify not only the prevalence of the
eight herding patterns, but also to follow the progression of each
herd as it grows, develops and disperses. It is interesting to note
that in our data, it is relatively rare that herds exhibit both a high
speed,
many tweets per
hour
on a subject,
and a converging
direction. This seems logical but it is precisely these rare events
that may be of particular interest to managers, as it is these herds
that most likely require their attention. The proposed framework
allows for the easy identification of such noteworthy herds.
Implications
Scientifically, the herding framework presented in this paper
may help with theory building for
herding behavior.
Future
theories or models of herding behavior may take the different
herding patterns into account because they help to separate the
important
group opinions from the background noise.
Until
now,
herding theory development
has focused mainly on the
types of social
interactions that
can lead to a herd emerging,
such as
mimicry or
observational
learning (Banerjee 1992;
Note: The two patterns not visible are Slow Meandering (back, lower left) and Fast Meandering 
(back, lower right). The Marching and Stampeding patterns are perhaps the only ‘true’ herding 
patterns in the generally accepted sense of the word, although this framework aids our understanding
of the related patterns which lead to them.

Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch 1998; Chen, Wang, and
Xie 2011).
No attention has
yet
been paid to mechanisms
driving behavioral
alignment
at
different
stages in a herd's
development, and yet it is quite likely that different processes of
social influence drive an initial, small herd, for example in the
fast meandering pattern, than a later, large herd. Our proposed
framework may help researchers to identify phases of
herd
development.
Added to this, our results show that, in the online setting we
study,
there is a dominant
path of
herd development:
most
herds that
become a stampede follow a consistent
transition
path as they first increase on the speed of contagion dimension,
then on the number of individuals dimension and then finally
on the uniformity of
direction dimension.
This
suggests
a
sequence of different
social influence processes,
and it
would
be useful to understand why the transition probabilities shown
in Table 5 and Fig.
2 occur.
For
example,
if
our
results are
shown to be robust,
why do herds that
begin small
and that
initially converge to a uniform direction, almost never develop
into large-scale stampedes? Theories that
can help to explain
the dominant
transition path we find may enrich the herding
patterns framework; perhaps by showing that herds that are not
too uniform tend to be inclusive,
whereby many potential
participants feel
that
their
opinion fits,
allowing the herd to
grow in number before a dominant opinion emerges.
Managerially, this paper provides a structured set of herding
types, which is a necessary step in allowing firms to understand
more clearly on a broad scale what
their consumers think and
what
they are doing.
By following real-time changes in the
herding patterns related to a brand campaign, marketing managers
can adapt the timing of their actions. The transition probabilities
between herding patterns
provide guidance for
this
type of
conclusion that may be investigated further. For instance, if they
want to stimulate a stampede, and they observe an increase in the
number of individuals participating in the discussion, whereby the
transition takes place from Fast
meandering to Hot
Brownian,
then they should focus their efforts on increasing the uniformity of
direction. Indeed, the finding that there is a dominant transition
path between herding patterns has a strong implication:
if this
result is found to be robust across a variety of data sets, then any
organization
that
is
particularly
interested
in
identifying
a
stampede needs to track only emerging herds following this
sequence
(whereby
speed,
then
magnitude,
then
direction
increases),
thereby reducing the need to spend resources fol-
lowing online interaction for a vast number of topics.
And any
organization interested in creating a stampede can take appropri-
ate action to develop the herd along this development path.
Managers can choose their marketing actions based on the
state a herd is in,
and they can intervene before a stampede
emerges.
For instance,
we speculate that it may be difficult to
change the direction of a herd once it has reached the Marching
or
Stampeding patterns,
whereas
a well-placed intervention
could tip the balance in a herd in the Hot
Brownian state.
Similarly,
a herd that is in the Fast meandering pattern (small
and non-uniform direction,
but
diffusing quickly)
may be a
threat in the long term if it expresses negative sentiments to a
brand,
whereas a herd in the Slow converging pattern (small
and slowly spreading, but with a converging direction) is likely
to remain a small herd that will disappear. This can be derived
from the transition probabilities in Table 5.
The subsequent question for managers is how to bring about
a desired shift
in the herding pattern.
This
study does
not
investigate different
intervention strategies although the three
dimensions of the herding framework provide some indication
of
how pattern transitions
can be stimulated.
For
example,
managers
can intervene by generating more attention for
a
brand-related issue (measured by number of individuals),
but
also by more subtle effects like increasing susceptibility by
priming (measured by speed of
contagion),
or
influencing
people who have already joined the herd to accept a particular
viewpoint
related
to
one
of
the
subtopics
(measured
by
uniformity of direction).
Limitations and Further Research
The conceptual
framework shown in Fig.
1 is the first
to
provide a structure for understanding different types of herding
patterns.
However,
this paper
has only begun to investigate
such patterns.
There are alternative versions of our framework
possible and an interesting avenue for further research would be
a comparison of alternative dimensions and alternative patterns.
Some options are exploring patterns like the long tail with some
dominant and many minority camps, growing discord or dissent
in the population, etc.
Obviously,
besides
contagion through the
herd,
external
influences will also play a role in online opinion dynamics, one
example being The New York Times that
publishes a weekly
roundup of trending topics on twitter that
are related to New
York. This exogenous effect is important and has been shown to
be a driver of behavior (Berger and Milkman 2012). However,
our objective is not to explain underlying mechanisms of online
mass behavior
but
to propose a new way of
describing such
behavior,
providing added guidance for the type and timing of
interventions. A potential future model could add to the herding
patterns by including endogenous and exogenous influences on
the transition probabilities.
A limitation of our empirical study is that Twitter is mostly used
for
sharing up-to-the-minute news items,
gossip and opinions
relevant to events of that day.
A next step in our research is to
investigate herding patterns with data from other online applica-
tions,
such as social
networking sites (e.g.
Facebook),
online
discussion forums (e.g. Huffington Post), and content communi-
ties (e.g.
YouTube).
Besides this,
our empirical study made the
assumption that hashtags on Twitter are a good way of identifying
herds. However, some hashtags may be very narrowly defined and
others more broadly defined. It could be that a number of narrowly
defined hashtags actually belongs to a single, undirected, herd. We
assume for this study that
this is not
a significant
problem,
as
people use hashtags for the very purpose of connecting with others
interested in the same topic. The natural process of discussion will
mean
that
dominant
hashtags
will
quickly
appear.
Further
research, including data from other online sources, will determine
the robustness
of
the herding framework and our
suggested
metrics.

The objective of this paper is to identify different forms of
herding, as online mass behavior that becomes aligned is not a
binary phenomenon.
However, once we become better able to
distinguish between herding patterns a highly relevant question
becomes,
What
are the effects
of
the different
patterns
on
marketing indicators, such as sales or stock prices? Investigat-
ing such marketing outcomes to show the relevance of different
herding patterns, or certain dynamic changes between patterns,
is an important area for future research.
We conclude by mentioning a promising field of research that
can
be
applied
to
the
herding
phenomenon:
multi-agent
simulation. The herding patterns discussed in this paper describe
characteristics
of
behavior
at
the population level.
We have
argued that awareness of the population's behavior is useful for
firms or governments in the context of marketing, policy support
and public opinion.
However,
the impact
of
interventions by
these organizations is measured via the behavior of individuals.
Therefore, an important next step in this research is to understand
the mechanisms in individual behavior that result in population
level
herding patterns as emergent
consequences.
Agent-based
modeling (ABM) is a modeling technique that is highly suited to
connect micro level behavior to macro level phenomena.
Online
mass
behavior
that
is
aligned but
not
centrally
coordinated,
which we call
herding,
is an important
phenom-
enon that requires more thorough scientific investigation. This
will
provide those confronted with herding in practice with
instruments to be able to intervene efficiently.
