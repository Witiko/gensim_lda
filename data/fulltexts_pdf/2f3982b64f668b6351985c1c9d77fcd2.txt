Abstract
Background: 
In public health surveillance, measuring how information enters and spreads through online communities may
help us understand geographical variation in decision making associated with poor health outcomes.
Objective: 
Our aim was to evaluate the use of community structure and topic modeling methods as a process for characterizing
the clustering of opinions about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines on Twitter.
Methods: 
The study examined Twitter posts (tweets) collected between October 2013 and October 2015 about HPV vaccines.
We tested Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) models for inferring topics associated with
tweets, and community agglomeration (Louvain) and the encoding of random walks (Infomap) methods to detect community
structure of the users from their social connections. We examined the alignment between community structure and topics using
several common clustering alignment measures and introduced a statistical measure of alignment based on the concentration of
specific topics within a small number of communities. Visualizations of the topics and the alignment between topics and communities
are presented to support the interpretation of the results in context of public health communication and identification of communities
at risk of rejecting the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines.
Results: 
We analyzed 285,417 Twitter posts (tweets) about HPV vaccines from 101,519 users connected by 4,387,524 social
connections. Examining the alignment between the community structure and the topics of tweets, the results indicated that the
Louvain community detection algorithm together with DMM produced consistently higher alignment values and that alignments
were generally higher when the number of topics was lower. After applying the Louvain method and DMM with 30 topics and
grouping semantically similar topics in a hierarchy, we characterized 163,148 (57.16%) tweets as evidence and advocacy, and
6244 (2.19%) tweets describing personal experiences. Among the 4548 users who posted experiential tweets, 3449 users (75.84%)
were found in communities where the majority of tweets were about evidence and advocacy.
Conclusions: 
The use of community detection in concert with topic modeling appears to be a useful way to characterize Twitter
communities for the purpose of opinion surveillance in public health applications. Our approach may help identify online
communities at risk of being influenced by negative opinions about public health interventions such as HPV vaccines.

Introduction
The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was first introduced
to reduce the incidence of HPV and the majority of cervical
cancers [1]. Despite evidence of its safety and efficacy [2-5],
the quality of information about the vaccine on the Web is varied
[6,7], and coverage of the vaccine is low in some countries,
including the United States [8]. For vaccines generally, there is
evidence to suggest that negative information about vaccines
from celebrities, health practitioners, and news media can
increase vaccine hesitancy and refusal [9-11]. Although the
HPV vaccine is still a recent addition to the armament of public
health, it is important to perform surveillance on social media
to understand various opinions about vaccination.
The use of social media information in public health applications
has previously centered on forecasting clinical outcomes that
have traditionally been measured using surveys and registries.
Applications 
of 
data 
mining 
using 
Twitter 
have 
included
influenza surveillance [12-14] and measuring spatial differences
in language or mood [15,16]. Sentiment and language analyses
on Twitter have been used as indicators for the geographical
variation in heart disease mortality [17]. Examples that are
relevant to our research include the use of topic modeling to
extract tobacco-related tweets in the United States [18] and the
surveillance of information about the misunderstanding and
misuse of antibiotics from online media [19]. There is a growing
area of research considering the spread of information, news,
and opinions about vaccines [20-24], and research in this area
focuses on measuring associations between misinformation,
beliefs, and decision making across a range of community health
practices [25].
People interact and form relationships to each other on social
media. With these relationships, communities are formed. The
structure 
of 
online 
communities 
influences—and 
can 
be
influenced by—the information that enters and is diffused
through them. Studies examining the spread of information
through online communities, social media, and news media
have shown that the heterogeneous social structure of the
network and external factors can play a role in how far and fast
new information spreads [26,27]. That competition between
memes and natural attrition may affect how far and fast they
can spread and how quickly they decay [28-30], and that topics
of interest in a community can also influence the formation and
persistence of social structure [31].
Differences in the content of the information posted in online
news and social media influence the variation in opinions and
beliefs in online communities. While the opinions held by
community 
members 
and 
the 
content 
they 
post 
are 
not
equivalent, we assume that the content provides a reasonable
proxy for the opinions that might influence decision making.
Topic modeling methods are appropriate for identifying thematic
structure (topic) within a set of tweets because they can be
applied to an unstructured corpus of documents and there is no
requirement that the topic be defined in advance [32]. The
primary challenge associated with applying topic modeling to
tweets comes from the short length of tweets (140 characters).
Despite this challenge, topic modeling has been used to examine
topics across a range of subjects on Twitter—by pooling tweets
to produce longer documents to analyze [33-35], or applying
extensions or alternatives to existing models that work better
on shorter documents [36-40].
We expected to find that homophily and contagion would lead
to a clustering of opinions in online communities, but to date
there has been little research done to measure this important
information 
for 
vaccines. 
Our 
aim 
was 
to 
evaluate 
the
combination 
of 
community 
structure 
and 
topic 
modeling
methods in measuring the distribution of topics about HPV
vaccines from the tweets posted by users within communities
on Twitter, with the broader goal of evaluating a new process
for characterizing online communities by the public health
information expressed by the community members.
Methods
Study Data
Using repeated searches via the Twitter Search Application
Programming Interface, we collected tweets about HPV vaccines
between October 1, 2013, and October 29, 2015, using the
keywords shown in Table 1. For each tweet labeled as English
language by Twitter, we stored the text of the tweet and the
related metadata. Each time a new user tweeted about HPV
vaccines for the first time in the period, we additionally collected
the lists of users they followed and who followed them. This
information on relationships was used later to construct the
network of users for our analysis. At the conclusion of the data
collection period, there were 302,856 tweets (including retweets)
and 112,944 users. Following the data collection, we removed
users who were suspended, protected, or deleted, which left
101,519 users and 285,417 tweets for the analysis.

We pre-processed the tweets prior to topic modeling. For words
that were hashtags (beginning with “#”) or usernames (beginning
with “@”), we made no further modifications. The remaining
words in the text of the tweet were converted to lowercase, and
we removed stop words, the word “RT” (which represents a
retweet), and any numerical values. We then applied the Porter
stemmer [41]. We excluded URLs (uniform resource locator)
generated 
from 
generic 
URL 
shortening 
services 
(eg,
“http://bit.ly”) and included the domain of any full URLs
identified from the list of expanded URLs. Document size plays
an important role in topic modeling methods [42], so we chose
to assign all of the tweets with fewer than three words to a single
extra topic (1114 tweets), leaving 284,303 tweets.
We ran Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the Dirichlet
Mixture Model (DMM) to infer the topics of the 125,003 unique
tweets that were identified within the set of 284,303 tweets after
pre-processing the text. After inferring the topics using LDA
and DMM, we mapped those topics back onto the full set, so
that each tweet was associated with a single topic.
We constructed the network from the 4,387,524 follower
connections among the 101,519 users using an undirected graph.
A node represents a user, and an edge between two users is
established if one was found to be following the other. The
network included 100,826 (99.32%) users comprising the single
largest connected component, 500 (0.49%) users who formed
smaller 
islands 
disconnected 
from 
the 
largest 
connected
component, and 193 (0.19%) disconnected users with no
connections to the core. Within the largest connected component,
the average number of social connections was 86.98 and the
largest number of connections was 18,635. We measured the
alignment between topics and communities for the users who
were part of the largest connected component. More details on
network construction are provided in Multimedia Appendix 1.
Community Detection
Community detection algorithms aim to find sets of nodes in a
graph that have a greater density of connections within their set
compared to across sets. Traditionally, community detection
algorithms 
produced 
a 
hard 
clustering—where 
each 
node
belongs to only one community [43-47]. Some of the more
recent methods have considered overlapping communities [48].
In this work, we chose two algorithms that assign each node to
a single community, are known to produce reliable results, and
work efficiently in large networks.
The Infomap algorithm was developed to extract community
structure in large complex networks [49]. Using random walks
as a proxy for the way that information flows through a system,
the method first determines the probability of visiting each node
in the network and then characterizes the community and node
structure of the network as a Huffman code. By progressively
modifying the community affiliation, the aim is to compress
the code describing the network to its smallest size. We used
the implementation of Infomap from igraph [50].
The Louvain algorithm is a relatively fast community detection
algorithm to compute and can therefore scale to large networks
[51]. The algorithm is agglomerative—nodes are initialized to
belong to a community of size one and sequentially aggregated
with the neighboring community that produces the greatest gain
in modularity (if a positive gain exists). Communities detected
in this first phase become nodes in a new network with edge
weights determined by the number of connections between the
communities from the first phase. The algorithm therefore
constructs a hierarchical representation of the network and
proceeds until no more modularity gains can be identified. The
final clustering that results from this procedure is used to define
the community structure. We used the code released by the
author of Louvain from MapEquation [52].
Topic Inference
Topic modeling is used to find natural clusters based on the
co-occurrence of words. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) model [53] and the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture
(DMM) model [54]. The LDA model is a standard method for
topic modeling, and the DMM model is a variant especially
developed for short documents such as tweets. When applying
the DMM model, only one topic is assigned to each document,
so we labeled each tweet according to the topic inferred by the
DMM model. For LDA—where a probability topic distribution
is produced for each document—tweets were labeled using the
topic with the largest probability [33,40,55]. We used the
implementation of LDA from gensim [56] and the jLDADMM
implementation of DMM [57]. For both methods, we used
standard settings for each model [39,55] and did not attempt to
optimize 
the 
parameters 
further. 
Details 
of 
the 
formal
specification and notations for the methods are provided in
Multimedia Appendix 1.
Alignment Measures
The aim of measuring the alignment between topics and
communities is to determine if the topics appear more frequently
within some communities relative to all others. Since each tweet
was associated with a single topic, we represented communities
by the distribution of topics in the tweets posted by the users in
that community. We adapted measures of alignment that are
typically used to quantify the quality of an estimated clustering
against an observed clustering to compare between the clustering
methods that use the observed structure (social connections)
and the clustering methods that use the observed content (topics
in tweets). There are several appropriate metrics for assessing
cluster quality in this scenario, including purity, normalized
mutual information (NMI), and the adjusted Rand index (ARI)
[39,58] (see Multimedia Appendix 1 for definitions).
While these typical metrics provide a general measure of the
alignment between community structure and the topics of the
tweets posted by users in those communities, they were not
useful for summarizing how topics may be disproportionately
represented within a small subset of the communities. We
therefore 
additionally 
considered 
a 
measure 
of 
topic
concentration (
TC
). We defined a 
TC
value by the smallest
number of communities required to cover a specified percentage
of the tweets about a given topic, so 
TC
95
is the number of
communities required to cover 95% of the tweets in that topic,
and 
TC
100
is the number of communities that covers every tweet
labeled with that topic. A lower 
TC
95
value therefore implies a

higher 
concentration 
of 
topics 
within 
a 
small 
number 
of
communities.
When 
comparing 
measures 
of 
topic 
concentration 
across
multiple networks to determine alignment, the differences in
the number of tweets associated with each topic can influence
the measures independently of the alignment, so we used
permutation tests to produce a fair comparison. The permutation
tests create a baseline distribution of 
TC
values that may occur
in the absence of any real alignment, which can then be used to
establish the level of alignment relative to the levels of alignment
that could be produced by chance [59]. To do this, we randomly
permuted the topics associated with each tweet such that the
distributions of tweets per topic and tweets per community
remained the same as the observed network. We then compared
the observed 
TC
95
values against the distribution of 
TC
95
values
produced in the permutation tests. Typical permutation tests
report the percentile of a single observed value within the
distribution 
of 
values 
produced 
after 
permutation. 
In 
the
permutation tests we applied, distributions of 
TC
95
values (one
for each topic) were produced rather than single values, so we
used a two-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov test to compare the
distributions. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic varies
between 0 and 1, and a higher test statistic means that the topics
were more concentrated within individual communities than
would be expected if the same number of tweets per topic were
randomly distributed across the communities.
Manual Intrusion Tests
We performed intrusion tests on the topics from the tweets. One
investigator, blinded to the results of the topic modeling, was
presented with sets of five test cases per pairwise combination
of topics. Each test case included the text of five tweets chosen
at random from one topic and one tweet chosen at random from
a different topic. The investigator was tasked with identifying
the tweet that did not belong to the topic. The results of these
intrusion tests indicated how well the topic modeling was able
to capture semantic differences in the tweets. We additionally
used the results of the intrusion tests to construct a hierarchy of
topics 
based 
on 
their 
semantic 
dissimilarity 
by 
applying
multidimensional scaling [60-62]. The method produces a
distance between every pair of topics, which is then used to
merge the closest topics to construct the hierarchy.
Results
Community Detection and Topic Modeling
The two community detection algorithms were applied to the
largest connected component of 100,826 users. Applying the
Louvain algorithm, we identified 38 distinct communities of
sizes between 3 and 21,733 users. The Infomap algorithm
identified 1334 distinct communities, ranging in size from 2 to
18,974 users.
We constructed a series of LDA and DMM models by varying
the number of topics between 5 and 200. From the purity, NMI,
and ARI scores, we found that the alignment between the
community structure and the topics was higher across all
measures for DMM compared to LDA. The highest purity score
(0.495) and the highest ARI scores (0.166) were found when
applying the DMM model with the Louvain algorithm. The
highest NMI score (0.185) was found when applying the DMM
model 
with 
the 
Infomap 
algorithm. 
The 
results 
of 
these
experiments suggest that the DMM topic model may have
produced a more realistic clustering of the tweets by topic.
The 
TC
95
scores were consistently higher when using the DMM
model compared to the LDA model (see Multimedia Appendix
1 for 
detailed 
results). 
In 
combination 
with 
the 
Infomap
algorithm, 
TC
95
scores were highest between 10 and 25 topics,
and in combination with the Louvain algorithm, 
TC
95
scores
were highest between 20 to 30 topics. Considering these results,
we used the DMM model (with 30 topics) and the Louvain
algorithm to demonstrate the characterization of the communities
by topic in what follows.
To illustrate how the topics tend to cluster within communities,
we selected three representative topics and visualized them in
the network constructed from the set of followers among the
100,826 users (Figure 1). The topics include one of the topics
that captured clinical and scientific evidence (Topic 27), the
topic comprising experiential tweets (Topic 0), and one of the
topics describing side effects and harms (Topic 26).
Topic 27 includes words that are common to published studies
about the efficacy of the vaccine such as “prevent,” “protect,”
“study,” “news,” and “research.” Links to news media alongside
other published articles and related media tended to be grouped
within this topic, and the topic is broadly represented throughout
the majority of the core network, including among the users
with 
the 
greatest 
number 
of 
connections 
(typically 
news
organizations 
in 
the 
center, 
and 
news 
organizations,
health-related magazines, and scientific journals to one side).
Topic 0 captures a large number of tweets from users describing
their own experiences with the vaccine, including temporal
words such as “today,” “get,” “got,” and “go.” Tweets including
phrases such as “my arm hurts like a...” were commonly
assigned to this topic, and these users appeared to share fewer
connections with other users posting about HPV vaccines.
In Topic 26, emotive words like “kill,” “victim,” and “death”
are common. Tweets that include links to specific antivaccine
websites were commonly assigned to this topic, and users
posting tweets in Topic 26 appeared to cluster with different
densities in three distinct groups that were separated from the
groups of users posting tweets labeled as Topic 27.

A network of 100,826 users (nodes) who posted tweets about HPV vaccines in the period. The sizes of the nodes are proportional to the
number of social connections they have in this network. Nodes are colored if they posted tweets labeled as Topic 0 (blue), Topic 26 (red), or Topic 27
(green). Node position was determined by a heuristic that attempts to locate connected nodes closer together, partially revealing the community structure.
Topic Grouping
We measured the quality of the topic modeling using the manual
intrusion tests. Overall, the correct intruder was identified in
63.7% of the 4650 tests, which is a clear departure from the
16.7% that would be expected by chance. The hierarchy
constructed 
from 
the 
manual 
intrusion 
tests 
revealed 
the
semantically similar topics (Figure 2). The topic groups were
(1) media debates, (2) politics and policy debates, (3) scandals
and conspiracies, (4) side effects and harms, (5) public health
advocacy, (6) clinical evidence, and (7) experiences. When
measured across the groups of topics, the intrusion test accuracy
was 76% and when measured within the groups of topics, the
intrusion test accuracy was 49%. These results suggest that the
separation among topic groups is clear (high score for intergroup
accuracy and low score for intragroup accuracy).
Using the topics groups, we were then able to characterize the
communities by the distribution of topics among the set of tweets
posted by the users in those communities. Figure 3 details the
topic distributions for three selected communities, notable
because 
they 
illustrate 
the 
concentration 
of 
vaccine
harms/conspiracies, evidence/advocacy, and experiential themes
within different communities. Note also that the number of
tweets per user is highest for users in the community that posts
tweets labeled mostly among the vaccine harms/conspiracies
theme and lowest for users in the community posting mostly
about their experiences with the HPV vaccine.
Across the set of all communities, we found that users posting
about their own experiences with the HPV vaccine belonged to
communities for which the majority of tweets were related to
evidence and advocacy. Of the 4548 users who posted tweets
labeled as experiential, 3449 (75.84%) belonged to communities
for 
which 
the 
majority 
of 
tweets 
were 
related 
to
evidence/advocacy, 674 (14.8%) belonged to communities for
which the majority of tweets were related to harms/conspiracies,
196 (4.3%) belonged to communities for which the majority of
tweets were experiential, and 229 (5.0%) belonged to the group
of users who were not connected to the core of the network.
Figures 4 and 5 detail the distribution of themes within the
communities.

Discussion
Principal Results
In this study, we sought to measure the alignment between the
community structure implicit among the follower network of
Twitter users posting tweets about HPV vaccines and the topics
about which they posted. Given what is already known about
the variable quality of information about HPV vaccines on
Twitter [22,23], we expected to find that some communities
would more often perpetuate negative opinions about HPV
vaccines and that these communities would be distinct from the
communities describing the favorable evidence or advocating
for its uptake. Using a statistical measure quantifying the
strength of the topic concentration, we found that some topics
were 
heavily 
concentrated 
within 
a 
small 
number 
of
communities, which was consistent with our expectations.
Compared to our previous work in this application domain
[22,23], the process described here provides a more nuanced
view of the specific concerns about HPV vaccines expressed
on social media and the ability to identify communities in which
these 
concerns 
were 
the 
predominant 
topics. 
Using 
the
combination of topic modeling and community structure to
characterize communities, we were able to identify communities
in 
which 
specific 
concerns 
about 
safety 
or 
politics 
were
predominant, as well as identify younger Twitter users who
posted experiential tweets and were at risk of greater exposure
to safety concerns than to evidence and advocacy, which may
occur between the first and subsequent doses of the vaccine.
Analysis of 
tweets for 
public health where opinions and
experiences are mixed have been investigated previously for
influenza, where some tweets may help identify influenza
incidence and others represent evidence dissemination or opinion
[21].
Comparison With Prior Work
A growing set of methods has been developed using either
structural information to improve inferences about the content
of a corpus, or the information characterizing the nodes in a
network to improve the analysis of the structure. Those aiming
to understand the content of tweets have used social connections
to improve tweet classification [22,63-65]. These studies have
considered mentions, retweets, and other forms of interaction
that are available on Twitter, but the use of information about
followers generally produced the highest levels of performance.
Other researchers have proposed methods for incorporating
network structure into topic modeling approaches in networks
other than Twitter [66,67]. Conversely, some studies have
considered the use of content associated with nodes in networks
to improve the quality of community detection [68,69]. Among
the studies examining documents and the structure between
them—such as emails [70], co-authorship [71], and Wikipedia
[72]—one study produced topic profiles for communities in a
similar fashion to the way we have done in Figure 3 [73]. The
approach we presented here differs from these studies because
we 
applied 
community 
detection 
and 
topic 
modeling
independently, rather than attempting to leverage the information
available about social connections to improve the quality of the

topic modeling process, or to use content information to improve
community structure or predict new connections.
Limitations
A limitation of this work is that we considered a single
application domain. While the uptake of vaccines is of critical
importance to public health, further testing on other application
domains would be required to determine the generalizability of
assessing topic concentrations as a way of characterizing Twitter
communities. A further limitation in our work is that we did not
consider the temporal dynamics of the topics or the community
structure in any detail. Given that the topics related to HPV
vaccines are likely to produce similar temporal patterns to those
observed by Leskovec et al [30], future work in this area may
benefit from further analysis of the relationship between the
temporal dynamics of the topics and the economy of attention
within communities, which has been explored elsewhere [28,29].
Finally, we considered the follower network as an undirected
network and did not incorporate weights or directionality based
on mutual followers, or the presence of retweets and mentions,
which would have provided a more nuanced representation of
the social connections and may have produced a different
community structure.
Future Directions
Our work here has potential implications for public health
practices. Applying topic modeling and community detection
methods in concert to a corpus of tweets about HPV vaccines,
we found that it was possible to characterize online communities
by the topics that are most heavily concentrated among their
tweets. One way of translating these methods into public health
practice would be to use these methods in combination with
new spatial and demographic estimation methods [74-76], to
produce spatiotemporal indicators that determine where and
when the growth of specific concerns may lead to increased
vaccine hesitancy or refusal. We think that these indicators may
have a future role in helping public health organizations design
interventions and communication strategies that are better
targeted and thus more efficient.
Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated a novel process for characterizing
the concentration of certain opinions in online communities by
independently applying existing community detection and topic
modeling methods, and quantifying the differences in the topic
distributions across communities. Among tweets about HPV
vaccines, we found that there were clear differences in the
distribution of topics across communities defined by the follower
network. In practice, public health organizations may wish to
consider 
identifying 
the 
locations 
and 
demographics 
of
communities 
that 
are 
at 
risk 
of 
exposure 
to 
antivaccine
information in 
order 
to 
intervene 
with 
positive 
messages
targeting the specific concerns identified through topic modeling.
The value of this work in public health includes a more nuanced
representation of the variety of concerns expressed about HPV
vaccines 
online 
and 
some 
practical 
steps 
towards 
the
development of an automated system for the surveillance of
public opinions with the purpose of understanding localized
differences in decision making and health behaviors.
