Abstract.
This demonstration describes the results of the first year of the Eu-
DML project, an initiative building a new multilingual service for searching and
browsing the content of existing European portals of mathematical content.
We
demonstrate the first
versions and proofs of concept
of the EuDML portal,
its
contents’ aggregator, and a toolset for added value.
About EuDML. — EuDML, the European Digital Mathematics Library (
www.eudml.eu
),
is a project that will build a new multilingual service for searching and browsing the con-
tent of existing European mathematical portals [5,1]. It will be based on a rich metadata
repository, aggregating metadata and full text of heterogeneous and multilingual collec-
tions of digitised and born digital content (articles, books, theses, etc.). The service will
merge and augment the information about each document from each collection,
and
also will match documents and references across the entire combined library. Entities
such as authors, bibliographic references and mathematical concepts will be singled out
and linked to matching items in the collections; similar mechanisms will be provided as
public web-services so that end-users or other external services will be able to discover
and link to EuDML items. This way, EuDML will be a new major international player in
the emerging landscape of scientific information discovery services, enabled for reuse
in new added value chains. EuDML is partially funded by the Competitiveness and In-
novation Framework Programme of the European Commission (CIP ICT PSP Digital
Libraries), grant agreement no. 250.503.
The EuDML Service Architecture. — The EuDML system can be summarised by the
use cases represented in Figure 1. The ultimate purpose will be to serve End Users, who
can search and browse anonymously, or can register for personalised services. A set of
Business Workers are intended to maintain the services and content,
while external
business partners contribute their content (bibliographic data and full texts for indexing
and added value services).

the EuDML website.

So far,
there are no access restrictions,
as all the services are
available for anonymous users. This demonstration contains approximately 55,000 doc-
uments, provided by a group of partners (CEDRAM, DML-CZ, DML-E, ELibM, GDZ,
NUMDAM, Portugaliæ Mathematica, and RusDML).

Fig. 1. The EuDML Use Cases
EuDML Content Aggregation. — One
of the first
project’s result was a de-
tailed analysis
of
the existing con-
tent
formats and metadata schemas
used throughout
partnering projects
and content
providers.
Informed by
this study,
a specification for
a Eu-
DML schema, heavily based on NLM
JATS
2
, was written down.
REPOX is a framework to manage
data sets. It comprises multiple chan-
nels to import
data from providers,
services
to transform data between
schemas according to specified rules,
and services to expose the results to
the exterior. REPOX allows to moni-
tor OAI-PMH
3
servers and schedule
data ingests.
Instances of REPOX for EuDML
are
currently
running
at
Instituto
Superior
Técnico (Lisbon)
and Cel-
lule MathDoc (Grenoble).
These in-
stances
aggregate the bibliographic
metadata collected up to now,
converted to EuDML format,
and exploited partially
within the portal.
REPOX is complemented by the EuDML Profile Report,
a service to inspect and
create statistics and metrics on data quality,
including whether the data conforms to
particular standards or patterns. All these can be accessed from the page set-up in the
EuDML website.

The EuDML Enhancer and Association Toolsets. — This demonstration also comprises
tools gathered or produced by EuDML partners as building bricks of enhancer tools,
whose functionality should check, normalize and enhance metadata collected from part-
ners,
including Zentralblatt MATH,
or extracted from the analysis of the full text of
