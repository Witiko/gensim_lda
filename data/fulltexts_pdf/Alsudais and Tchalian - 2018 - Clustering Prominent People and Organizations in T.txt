Abstract
Named entities in text documents are the 
names of people, organization, location or 
other types of objects in the documents that 
exist in the real world. A persisting research 
challenge 
is 
to 
use 
computational 
tech-
niques to identify such entities in text doc-
uments. Once identified, several text min-
ing tools and algorithms can be utilized to 
leverage these discovered named entities 
and improve NLP applications. In this pa-
per, 
a 
method 
that 
clusters 
prominent 
names of people and organizations based 
on their semantic similarity in a text corpus 
is proposed. The method relies on common 
named entity recognition techniques and on 
recent word embeddings models. The se-
mantic similarity scores generated using the 
word embeddings models for the named en-
tities are used to cluster similar entities of 
the people and organizations types. Two hu-
man judges evaluated ten variations of the 
method after it was run on a corpus that 
consists of 4,821 articles on a specific topic. 
The performance of the method was meas-
ured using three quantitative measures. The 
results of these three metrics demonstrate 
that the method is effective in clustering se-
mantically similar named entities.

Introduction 
Researchers and scientists often turn to textual data 
to study social phenomena (Baker, Gabrielatos, and 
Mcenery 2013; Dimaggio, Nag, and Blei 2013; 
Jaworska and Krishnamurthy 2012). Mining those 
data allows researchers to generate insights about 
the grammatical features, linguistic content and so-
cial context of such phenomena (Li and Dash 2010; 
Yuan, Lau, and Xu 2016). Researchers use com-
mon text mining methods such as topic modeling 
and entity extraction to explore text corpora, iden-
tifying patterns and generating insights and also 
confirming and disconfirming hypotheses. Gener-
ating genuine insights through these methods re-
quires the development of novel algorithms but, 
equally, their rigorous application in methods that 
are 
being 
continuously 
developed. 
Therefore, 
novel text mining algorithms that produce specific, 
consistent and relevant results are especially bene-
ficial for many business intelligence systems and 
tools (Liu, Li, and Thomas 2017). 
When examining a text corpus, one preliminary 
step in generating specific, relevant insights is to 
identify prominent entities, such as individuals, or-
ganizations and places mentioned in the corpus. 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) refers to the 
computational task of identifying real-world enti-
ties in text documents. Once identified and tagged, 
named entities may be utilized in information sys-
tems to enhance applications and tools as well as to 
generate useful information. The process of identi-
fying and ranking the most prominent named enti-
ties in a corpus is often used in commercial text 
mining tools, which rely on popular NER algo-
rithms. The need to generate relevant insights in 
text mining methods has substantially raised the 
bar for NER, necessitating additional investiga-
tions into the relatedness and similarity across 
tagged 
entities 
to locate groups 
of 
actors that 
2 
influence and help structure a discourse. While ear-
lier entity recognition methods helped answer sim-
ple questions about the frequency and occurrence 
of entities, newer methods help answer more com-
plex questions about who the actors are (political, 
economic, technical), the consistent patterns of co-
occurrence they exhibit, and their shared interests 
in relation to a topic of interest. 
While generating new analytical possibilities, how-
ever, many novel NER features have suffered from 
questionable rigor and replicability. The novel text 
mining method known as word embeddings prom-
ises to remedy this situation. Word embeddings re-
fers to models that create dense vector representa-
tions for words or phrases in a text corpus by uti-
lizing their immediate syntactic context, defined by 
a window of proximate terms (Alsudais, Tchalian, 
and Hilton 2016). These models have recently 
gained popularity, due in large part to the higher 
analytical bar required of text mining methods. 
Their greater analytical power is in turn due to ad-
vances in computing power that have made the cre-
ation of vectors for large corpora more feasible and 
less time- and compute-intensive. Successful mod-
els for generating vector representations for words 
and 
phrases 
such 
as 
Skip-gram 
and 
CBOW 
(Mikolov et al. 2013), GloVe (Pnnington, Socher, 
and 
Manning 
2014), 
and 
others 
(Levy 
and 
Goldberg 2014; Turian, Ratinov, and Bengio 2010) 
have proven successful in performing various lan-
guage-related analytics tasks. These tasks include 
solving analogies and translating text across natural 
languages with the use of dictionaries. One of the 
most beneficial features of these new word embed-
ding methods captures semantic similarities across 
words and phrases in a corpus. This similarity fea-
ture may be used, for example, to capture and de-
tect the semantic changes in the meaning of partic-
ular 
words 
over 
a 
pre-defined 
period 
of 
time 
(Hamilton, Leskovec, and Jurafsky 2016; Kulkarni 
et al. 2015). This application demonstrates the po-
tential of using the new feature to solve new and 
challenging questions in the text-mining domain. 
The objective of this paper is to resolve one of these 
questions: Is it possible to create an NLP pipeline 
that reliably and consistently clusters named enti-
ties (people and organizations) in a corpus by uti-
lizing their semantic similarity as generated by a 
semantic word embeddings model? 
In this paper, semantic similarities generated by 
Skip-gram and CBOW are employed to cluster the 
most 
prominent 
named 
entities 
in 
a 
corpus. 
Clustering named entities is a recognized approach 
for leveraging tagged entities (Hasegawa, Sekine, 
and Grishman 2004). When clustering named enti-
ties, similar named entities are grouped within the 
same cluster based on their similarity values, which 
are detected using a purpose-built, reliable similar-
ity function. Thus, an underlying metric for captur-
ing the similarities between the entities must be uti-
lized. The method offers a rigorous and reliable al-
ternative to simple clustering methods, offering in-
formation systems researchers a replicable method 
for generating results and insights in various text 
mining and NER applications. 
When training a Skip-gram or CBOW model on a 
topic-specific corpus, one may also discover rela-
tionships between words and entities in the collec-
tion that are otherwise latent and difficult to detect. 
According to Thomas Mikolov, the chief scientist 
behind the two models, the learned word vectors 
are only effective if they are used to accomplish 
other tasks. For example, Mikolov suggests using 
word vectors and K-means clustering to create 
classes for the words in the collection. While that is 
useful and currently achievable using the word2vec 
software, additional modifications and customiza-
tions are required to implement problem-specific 
solutions that build on that idea. Generating addi-
tional insights in a consistent, replicable way from 
the 
relationship 
among 
tagged 
named 
entities 
therefore offers information systems researchers 
numerous benefits, including enhancing Question 
Answering (QA) systems and automating the pop-
ulation process in ontologies (Marrero et al., 2013). 
This paper develops a novel full-scale, reliable and 
replicable method for semantically clustering sim-
ilar named entities, primarily of the “people” and 
“organization” type, based on the similarity scores 
as generated by a Skip-gram or CBOW model. It 
does so by: (1) using NER to locate named entities 
in the text, such as the names of real-world organi-
zations; (2) using semantic similarity vectors as 
captured by a word embedding model; (3) deploy-
ing a reliable algorithm to cluster the entities ac-
cording to the resulting vectors. The preliminary 
empirical findings and quantitative evaluation of 
the method demonstrate that the it is successful in 
clustering and grouping named entities that have 
similar roles in the text or are members of the same 
abstract classes.

Methodology 
In this section, the method proposed to identify 
and cluster named entities in a text corpus is de-
scribed. The method relies on three major compo-
nents: named entity recognition, word embeddings, 
and clustering. Figure 1 demonstrates the three ma-
jor steps in the method and the relevant tasks that 
take place in each step. In the first step, named en-
tities in the corpus are identified and then ranked 
according to the frequency in which they were used 
in the articles of the corpus. In the second step, a 
word embeddings model is applied on the collec-
tion to generate semantic similarity scores across 
the named entities in the corpus. In the final step, a 
clustering operation is performed on a symmetrical 
matrix that consists of top named entities to iden-
tify clusters of similar individuals and organiza-
tions in the corpus. This section describes the three 
steps, the rationale behind each task proposed for 
each step, and the underlying assumptions that 
were made. 
2.1
Named Entity Recognition 
Named entities refers to the names of people and 
organizations that exist in the real world. Named 
Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of processing 
a body of text and classifying segments in the text 
that are named entities. Researchers have been at-
tempting to solve this problem for decades (Nadeau 
and Sekine 2006). Several highly accurate and re-
liable algorithms for capturing named entities cur-
rently exist (Finkel, Grenager, and Manning 2005; 
Mccallum and Li 2003). Recent work in the area 
has focused on increasing the accuracy of named 
entity taggers by leveraging advances in neural net-
works (Chiu and Nichols 2016; Lample et al. 
2016). 
However, 
these 
new 
models 
are 
only 
slightly more effective than their traditional coun-
terparts. Several named entity extraction methods 
target unique types of corpora such as tweets 
(Habib and Van Keulen 2015; Ritter, Clark, and 
Etzioni 2011) and biomedical data (Habibi et al. 
2017; Tang et al. 2015). Additionally, certain meth-
ods are designed for specific languages such as 
Chinese (Lei et al. 2014; Peng and Dredze 2016) 
and Arabic (Althobaiti, Kruschwitz, and Poesio 
2015; Oudah and Shaalan 2016). 
There are multiple categories for named entities 
including the names of people, organizations, loca-
tions, and time units. Since the primary motivation 
of the proposed method is to semantically cluster 
similar people and organizations, named entities of 
other types such as “location” and “time” have 
been discarded. However, other named entity types 
should be considered in future extensions of the 
method. 
In this paper, Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005) 
is used in the first step in the proposed method. 
Stanford NER, which is based on an older mecha-
nism of detecting named entities, is a highly accu-
rate tagger that performs well on text extracted 
from newspaper articles. According to Finkel et al. 
(2005), Stanford NER achieved an F1 score (a 
composite measure employed to determine the ac-
curacy of a classifier) of 86% when trained on the 
CoNLL-2003 named entity dataset (Tjong et al., 
2003). The NER process followed in this paper is 
initiated by tokenizing each article in the collection 
individually, in order to locate the set of sentences 
in the article. Subsequently, the Stanford NER pro-
gram is run on each extracted sentence. 
4 
The next task in this step is entity linking. Entity 
linking is the process of matching different seg-
ments of text that belong to the same real-world en-
tity. For instance, “Barack Obama” and “Barack H. 
Obama” refer to the same person, and an entity 
linking procedure should be able to recognize this 
and match the two variations of the name accord-
ingly. To increase the performance of the proposed 
method, a “soft” entity linking process is per-
formed on tagged names of people at the article-
level. An attempt to match entities is performed by 
taking advantage of the fact that in English, full 
names of individuals are commonly written in their 
entirety the first time they are mentioned in an arti-
cle, whereas subsequently, they are referred to only 
by their last name. The task relies on removing 
middle initials and the word “Mr.” that often pre-
cedes people’s last names from tagged named enti-
ties in these later mentions. Therefore, the proposed 
task of entity linking relies on inspecting whether a 
“last name” in the article has been mentioned ear-
lier as a portion of a full name. Future implementa-
tions of this approach will extend the methodology 
to recognize other titles prefixing a person’s name 
such as “Dr.,” ‘Mrs.,” “Miss,” etc. For organiza-
tional names, no attempts were made to match en-
tities. For example, “SEC” and “Securities and Ex-
change Commission” were captured as separate en-
tities. This is a limitation of the current method that 
will also be explored in future extensions. 
The final task in the named entities recognition 
process involves replacing named entities in each 
article with their full names as captured in the “en-
tity linking” task with their corresponding entity 
type. For example, each occurrence of the names 
“Barack Obama” and “Barack H. Obama” would 
be resolved to “Barack_Obama_PER” in a given 
article. The underscores replace empty spaces so 
that the word embeddings model can recognize the 
name as a single entity and then process it accord-
ingly. The tag “_PER” is used to indicate that the 
named entity is of the “person” type while the tag 
“_ORG” is used to indicate that the named entity is 
of the “organization” type. The types are added to 
the names so that they may be later retrieved using 
a word embeddings model. 
2.2
Word Embeddings 
Word embeddings refers to models that create 
dense vector representations for words or phrases 
in a text corpus by utilizing their immediate syntac-
tic context, defined by a window with proximate 
terms. Word embeddings models (Baroni et al., 
2014), which rely on attempts to “predict” word 
vectors, are better at capturing semantic similarities 
between words as compared to traditional “count-
ing” methods that use either Positive Pointwise 
Mutual Information (PPMI) or Local Mutual Infor-
mation (LMI) to weigh the features in the vectors. 
Researchers have demonstrated how this similarity 
feature available in word embeddings models may 
be employed to accomplish several challenging 
language-related tasks. 
Once all the named entities in the corpus are 
tagged, the next step is to run a word embeddings 
model on the modified corpus. The objective of this 
step is to detect the semantic similarity across 
named entities in the corpus. In this study, two pop-
ular word embeddings models, CBOW and Skip-
gram, are tested and applied on a text corpus. Both 
models are used to investigate whether the perfor-
mance of the proposed method is affected by the 
model that is employed to capture the similarity be-
tween the named entities. The implementation of 
CBOW and Skip-gram in the Python package gen-
sim (Rehurek and Sojka 2010) is used to run the 
models. Running the two models generates word 
vectors for named entities in the collection. These 
vectors and similarity scores are used in the follow-
ing step to cluster the named entities. 
2.3
Clustering Prominent Named Entities 
Clustering is a traditional data mining technique 
that is used to group similar items based on an un-
derlying similarity metric. Clustering may be ap-
plied to different types of data including text. In the 
text mining domain, clustering may be used to 
group text segments such as words, terms, sen-
tences, topics, or documents. The results of clus-
tered text data may be utilized to enhance text min-
ing tasks such as corpus summarization and docu-
ment classification (Aggarwal and Zhai 2012). In 
this paper, clustering is applied on a matrix that 
consists of the top named entities in a collection 
and their similarity values. The purpose of this 
clustering procedure is to discover semantic roles, 
labels, and categories. 
Several clustering algorithms currently exist, 
and for this paper, K-means is used as the clustering 
algorithm. In K-means, objects are portioned into 
different groups where each cluster contains at least 
one item. No items may be placed into more than 
one cluster. The number of clusters ‘K’ must be 
specified prior to initiating the algorithm. Choosing 
5 
the most appropriate K is an ongoing research 
problem. For the proposed method, K is calculated 
by dividing the number of top terms to be clustered 
by the number 10, a common practice when using 
K-means 
clustering. 
Implementing 
a 
different 
method of calculating K or using a clustering algo-
rithm other than K-means such as the silhouette 
method or X-means clustering might produce bet-
ter results. These methods were not employed in 
this study and present opportunities for future re-
search and refinement. 
The final task in the method is to identify and 
cluster the N top named entities in the corpus. To 
accomplish this goal, a symmetrical N x N matrix 
is first constructed. In this matrix, the columns and 
rows consist of all the named entities in the top N 
named entities list. For each entity in the rows sec-
tion, a vector is created. The vector consists of the 
similarity values as generated by the word embed-
dings model between the entity and the correspond-
ing entities in the columns section. The concluding 
step is to then cluster the entities in the rows section 
using K-means clustering. 
The top terms lists are generated by counting the 
number of articles for each named entity in the cor-
pus where the named entity appeared and then se-
lecting the top N named entities. The number of ar-
ticles was used as a unit of measure rather than the 
raw frequency to provide additional rigor and to 
avoid assigning a large weight to named entities 
that appeared many times in the corpus but in only 
a small number of articles. Using a larger corpus is 
recommended, since a larger set of terms is more 
likely to accurately and precisely identify a subset 
of top terms. (See further details in section 2.4.) To 
maintain the automation of the method, qualita-
tively refining and filtering terms in the top terms 
lists was avoided. Thus, terms that are erroneously 
tagged as named entities and appear in the top 
terms list are kept, even though they contribute 
negatively to the results. The rationale behind this 
approach is to refrain from using experts’ opinions 
to modify the lists. The approach allows greater 
replicability of the method by relying exclusively 
on quantitative results, without subjective modifi-
cations by experts, while sacrificing very little in 
accuracy and precision. 
In this paper, five different top named entities 
lists are tested. The lists differ in two core varia-
bles: (1) the number of terms in the list (either 100 
or 200) and (2) the type of named entities in the list. 
Two of the lists contains entities of the “people” 
type, two of the lists contains entities of the “organ-
izations” type, and one list contains entities of both 
the “people” and “organization” types. 
2.4
Data 
The method proposed in this paper was devel-
oped for use on a large text corpus. A large corpus 
is required because word embeddings models per-
form best on large corpora and often fail when ap-
plied on small ones. In this study, a large text cor-
pus on “corporate governance” was used (Alsudais 
and Tchalian 2016). Table 1 includes the sources 
used to build the dataset.

Experiment 
In this section, an experiment to test and evalu-
ate the proposed method is explained. The method 
was tested on the “corporate governance” corpus 
described in the previous section. Five top terms 
lists were investigated. The lists were: (1) top 100 
tagged entities of the “person” type (T100_P); (2) 
top 
200 
tagged 
entities 
of 
the 
“person” 
type 
(T200_P); (3) top 100 tagged entities of the “organ-
ization” type (T100_O); (4) top 200 tagged entities 
of the “organization” type (T200_O); and (5) a 
combined list of the top 100 tagged entities of both 
the “person” and “organization” types (T200_PO). 
Both CBOW and Skip-gram models were used to 
generate vectors for the named entities. The mod-
els’ implementations in the Python package gensim 
(Rehurek and Sojka 2010) were used. For both 
models, the number of dimensions was set to 500 
and the window size was set to 10. For each one of 
the five lists, two N x N matrices were constructed 
with the semantic similarity between the variables 
in the row and column as the values of the cells. 
Therefore, ten matrices were constructed. The val-
ues in the first matrix were derived from the results 
generated using CBOW whereas the values in the 
second were derived from the results generated us-
ing Skip-gram. The purpose of testing these varia-
tions was to investigate whether the changes in the 
models or the type of input would generate im-
proved results.

3.1
Evaluation Metrics 
For quantitative evaluation, three metrics were 
used. These metrics relied on two domain experts 
who manually reviewed the results. These experts 
were asked to complete two tasks: (1) indicate 
whether a logical and semantic role or class might 
be inferred and used to label at least the majority of 
terms for each cluster identified by the method; 
and, if that was the case, (2) indicate for each 
named entity in the cluster whether the entity be-
long to the category identified for the cluster. Ac-
cordingly, three evaluation metrics were used. In 
text mining, these metrics are typically used to 
evaluate topic modeling and clustering algorithms. 
The first metric is a coherence measure that is used 
to evaluate the average coherence of the clusters. 
The second metric is a standard precision measure 
that is employed to quantify how “precise” the 
method is in assigning terms to clusters. The third 
metric is a coherent clusters metric that is used to 
quantify the number of clusters that comprise a 
meaningful class or category and may be tagged 
with a class label. 
3.1.1
Coherence Measure 
The coherence measure is a metric that is com-
monly used when evaluating topic models. Coher-
ence measures have been used in other studies 
(Qiang et al., 2016; Xie & Xing, 2013; Xie et al., 
2015). There are many automated methods for pro-
ducing coherence scores. However, it has been ar-
gued that coherence values based on human judge-
ment are still superior (Röder et al., 2015). Addi-
tionally, many of these automated metrics rely on 
co-occurrence values between two terms at the sen-
tence or article levels. This makes the metrics un-
suitable for use in the proposed method since two 
terms might be accurately placed in the same clus-
ter according to the proposed method even if their 
co-occurrences value was low. The terms would be 
placed in the same cluster since they are semanti-
cally similar because they share similar neighbor-
ing words. An example of this is a cluster labeled 
“corrupt CEOs” where accurately placed terms in 
the cluster would be names of corrupt CEOs who 
may 
have 
similar 
neighboring 
words 
such 
as 
“CEO,” “crooked,” and “corrupt” yet still have low 
values as generated by traditional co-occurrence-
based metrics. 
Human judges are therefore used to evaluate the 
coherence or clusters for purposes of developing 
and testing the method proposed in this paper. The 
coherence of a cluster is calculated based on the ra-
tio of the number of relevant terms in the cluster to 
the total number of terms in the cluster. A judge is 
asked to infer a label for an examined cluster. If a 
label can be found, the judge manually tags irrele-
vant terms in the cluster that do not fit and therefore 
do not belong to the cluster. The overall coherence 
for a method is calculated by averaging the individ-
ual coherence values for the clusters in the set. The 
formula for calculating the coherence value of a 
cluster is: 
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟 
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟 
Similar to the evaluation process in Qiang et al. 
(2016), all terms within a cluster are considered ir-
relevant if the judge is unable to infer a semantic 
label or class for the cluster. 
3.1.2
Precision Measure 
For the precision measure, the values are calcu-
lated by considering the number of True Positive 
(TP) and False Positive (FP) named entities in the 
results previously tagged by the judges. The stand-
ard formula for calculating the precision value is: 
𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃
A TP named entity is defined as a named entity 
that has been accurately placed in a cluster and con-
firmed by a judge. Conversely, a FP named entity 
is an entity that the judge has tagged as an entity 
that has been inaccurately placed in the cluster. 
Similar to the process followed for the coherence 
measure, all entities in a cluster are tagged as false 
positive (Type I error) if the judge is unable to infer 
a semantic label or class for the cluster. 
3.1.3
Coherent Clusters Measure 
The third measure used in this paper is a coher-
ent clusters measure. The purpose of this measure 
is to quantify the number of clusters that are labeled 
as valid by the judges. The formula for calculating 
the coherent clusters measure is the following: 
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑠 "𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒" 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 (𝐾)
The judges were instructed to tag a cluster as ac-
curate if at least the majority of the entities in the 
cluster could be grouped under the same semantic 
class or label. An example of a label for a cluster 
would be “corrupt CEOs” or “companies that faced 
7 
scandals 
in 
the 
past.” 
Since 
the 
previous 
two 
measures were heavily influenced by false positive 
terms, this metric could be used to provide addi-
tional insights on the performance of the method 
and to measure the method’s ability to produce 
strong clusters even when some of the clusters con-
tain several noisy terms. Furthermore, this measure 
might be employed to hint at how the results of the 
method might be interpreted by a domain expert 
who might manually eliminate problematic terms 
that negatively affect otherwise strong clusters.

Results 
In this section, results of running the method on 
the “corporate governance” corpus using the previ-
ously described top named entities lists as well as 
both CBOW and Skip-gram are described. The 
judges were asked to analyze the generated clusters 
using ten variations of the method. The judges were 
given the results of the ten variations without any 
indicators of the underlying model or list used. Se-
lected clusters from the first nine methods are dis-
played in Appendix A. Named entities that judges 
deemed unfit for a discovered cluster are desig-
nated in italics. The first line in each table describes 
the type of top named entities list and word embed-
dings model used. For instance, T100_O and Skip-
gram refer to the list of the top 100 named entities 
of the “organizations” type and to the Skip-gram 
model. The second line in each table includes the 
labels created by the judge for the cluster. The third 
row in each table contains the terms within the clus-
ters. 
While improvements can be made, these results 
demonstrate the method’s ability to detect seman-
tically similar clusters of people and organizations 
in a text corpus. The method was quantitatively 
evaluated based on the three quantitative measures: 
coherence measure, precision measure, and coher-
ent clusters measure. 
The results for the three measures indicate that 
the method was successful in detecting semantic 
categories of similar people and organizations. Un-
der all three measures, one of the judges evaluated 
the method slightly more favorably than the other. 
One possible explanation for this is that one of the 
judges tagged some of the broad clusters as inco-
herent. With respect to the performance of CBOW 
and Skip-gram, averaging the results for all ten var-
iations indicated that the results were more accu-
rate when using Skip-gram. These findings are 
identical to those of previous studies that compared 
the performance of these two methods for various 
language-related tasks (Chen et al., 2015). 
The quantitative results suggest that the method 
performed best when the lists included only people 
or 
only 
organizations.

achieved when the top 100 named entities tagged 
with the “organization” type was processed using 
Skip-gram and then clustered using a K size of 10. 
The coherence and precision measures were 80.8% 
and 80.4%, respectively, and the judges found that 
eight and one half out of the ten clusters were valid. 
The results of the coherence measure indicate that 
the average values for all variations were higher 
than 50%. Table 2 includes the detailed results of 
the coherence measures for the ten variations of the 
method. The results show that the method performs 
slightly higher when Skip-gram was used and that 
the most coherent clusters were identified when 
Skip-gram was employed to cluster the entities in 
the top 100 organizations list. 
The results of the precision measure were simi-
lar to those of the coherence measure, with Skip-
gram averaging a few percentage points higher 
than CBOW. Table 3 shows a complete breakdown 
of the precision values for the ten variations. The 
best overall precision value was attained when 
Skip-gram and the T200_O list were used. The 
lowest value was 58.7% suggesting that the method 
provided useful information even when performing 
at its worst. Several inaccurately tagged named en-
tities that were meaningless and did not represent a 
real-world person or organization, such as “John” 
and “Messes,” negatively affected the performance 
of the precision measure as they were flagged as 
unfit by the judges. 
The third and final measure was the coherent 
clusters measure, which was based on counting the 
number of clusters that the judges deemed as being 
logical and accurately representing a semantic cat-
egory. The results of this measure were the most 
promising. For many of the variations, the judges 
found that 80% of the groups captured by the 
method were valid and coherent. This suggests that 
the method may be produce more accurate results 
and demonstrate greater precision if a domain ex-
pert examines the results and removes unfit terms 
from each cluster. Users of the method can use 
these tradeoffs to help balance automation with er-
ror rates for individual cases.

Discussion and Conclusion 
In this paper, a new method that utilizes existing 
and accepted techniques to cluster named entities 
of the “person” and “organization” types in a topic-
specific corpus based on the semantic similarities 
between the entities as predicted by the CBOW and 
Skip-gram models is introduced. The method was 
tested on a corpus that consists of news articles 
containing the term “corporate governance” pub-
lished in four of the leading newspapers in the 
United States between 1978 and 2004. The results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method when 
evaluated using quantitative metrices. 
Observations with respect to the results of the 
process performed by the two annotators suggest 
that the method effectively captured semantic clus-
ters of named entities. For example, when using 
Skip-gram and the list of top 100 organizations, in-
vestment banks was one of the identified clusters 
(Appendix A). The investment banks cluster in-
cluded banks such as “Morgan Stanley” and “Mer-
rill Lynch”. Another cluster found while using 
Skip-gram and the list of top 100 organizations was 
a narrower cluster that included companies dealing 
with financial crises in the early 2000s and two of 
their auditors. This kind of information might be 
valuable for non-domain experts as it captures in-
formation that is specific to a topic-specific corpus. 
An additional observation was that changing the 
list of top named entities affected the performance 
of the clustering procedure. Using lists of only peo-
ple or only organizations generated more coherent 
results. Furthermore, results indicated that using 
Skip-gram generated more coherent clusters when 
compared to CBOW. The result of the quantitative 
measures agreed with these observations. 
As shown in Appendix A, it was observed that 
some of the clusters were narrow and defined 
9 
whereas others were broader and more abstract. 
Narrow clusters are ones that are unique to the da-
taset and the analyzed corpus. Example of such 
clusters are “corporate governance experts” and 
“companies in crisis in the 1980s.” On the other 
hand, broad clusters are those that represent seman-
tic categories that are more universal such as “uni-
versities” and “financial services firms.” Table 5 
includes a sample of narrow and broad clusters.

While the results are promising, there remain 
several limitations in the method and the paper. 
First, the method was tested and evaluated on a sin-
gle corpus. Thus, testing the method on a different 
dataset might not produce results with higher error 
rates than those attained in this corpus. Addition-
ally, latent issues in the method might be revealed. 
Second, due to the historical context of the corpus 
used in this paper, it was difficult for the two judges 
to fairly evaluate some of the extracted clusters. 
Some of the clusters represented narrow and spe-
cific categories that might be challenging to inter-
pret and label, even for domain experts, suggesting 
that some of the reported results may have fewer 
errors than those reported in the paper. Finally, 
while entity linking techniques were used for enti-
ties of the person type, similar techniques were not 
employed for entities of the organization type. 
Thus, many replicates existed in the top organiza-
tions lists. 
There are also several areas where the method 
employed in this paper may be enhanced in future 
work. First, the techniques used to generate the top 
terms lists may be improved. Currently, the top 
named entities lists are generated by counting the 
number 
of 
articles 
that 
named 
entities 
appear 
within, and then ranking the named entities accord-
ingly. It is possible that the use of more complex 
alternatives that leverage additional information 
pertaining to the entities could significantly im-
prove the results. Second, the current method as-
sumes a fully automated process with no expert in-
tervention. The coherence of the clusters will im-
prove if a domain expert is providing expert feed-
back at various points. This expert feedback may 
occur after generating the top terms lists by having 
the expert flag terms that are inaccurately tagged as 
named entities. Third, since the method was per-
formed on a text corpus with a long duration, run-
ning the method on different time periods in the 
collections might produce different or more in-
formative results. For example, one of the identi-
fied clusters was labeled “companies facing crises 
in the early 2000s.” This category would clearly 
not have been identified if the method was run on 
a period consisting of articles published from 1995 
to 1999. Running the analysis on a different text 
corpus with a narrower or less historically bounded 
context may provide fewer time markers and there-
fore produce different results. Finally, the applica-
tion of the method on time periods in the collection 
might provide additional insights with respect to 
the evolution of semantic
