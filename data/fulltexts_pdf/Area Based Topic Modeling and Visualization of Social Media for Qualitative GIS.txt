Area-Based Topic Modeling and Visualization of
Social Media for Qualitative GIS
Michael E. Martin and Nadine Schuurman
Department of Geography, Simon Fraser University
Qualitative geographic information systems (GIS) has progressed in meaningful
ways since early calls for a
qualitative GIS in the 1990s.
From participatory methods to the invention of the participatory geoweb and
finally to geospatial social media sources, the amount of information available to nonquantitative GIScientists
has grown tremendously. Recently, researchers have advanced qualitative GIS by taking advantage of new data
sources,
like Twitter,
to illustrate the occurrence of
various phenomena in the data set geospatially.
At the
same time, computer scientists in the field of natural language processing have built increasingly sophisticated
methods for digesting and analyzing large text-based data sources. In this article, the authors implement one of
these methods, topic modeling, and create a visualization method to illustrate the results in a visually compara-
tive way, directly onto the map canvas. The method is a step toward making the advances in natural language
processing available to all GIScientists. The article discusses the ways in which geography plays an important
part in understanding the results presented from the model
and visualization,
including issues of
place and
space. Key Words: big data, qualitative GIS, social media analysis, topic model, visualization.

O
ver the past decade, there have been increas-
ing inroads in the quest for a truly qualitative
geographic
information system (GIS;
Jung
2007,
2015;
Zook et al.
2010;
Crooks
et al.
2013;
Ghosh and Guha 2013). Although GIS scholars have
made
progress
toward
creating
such
a
system,
solutions to date have not been successful in reaching
a
widespread audience.
The
dearth of
widespread
integrated qualitative GIS analysis methods and tools
has not been without cause,
however,
as qualitative
data are challenging to express spatially and methods
of
qualitative analysis are difficult to integrate with
traditional GIS software. In this article, we present a
method that supports qualitative geospatial
analysis
and
provides
an
example
for
future
research
initiatives.

Qualitative GIS has been the goal of nonquantita-
tive and critical
scholars
for
its
ability to introduce
human experience to maps (Elwood 2006; Knigge and
Cope 2006; Brown and Knopp 2008). With the advent
of social media, a new and profoundly different source
of information is available to researchers that provides
an opportunity to represent
people using their
own
voice (Elwood,
Goodchild,
and Sui
2013).
Although
other
disciplines
of
science,
in particular
computing
science, continue to make inroads to integrating social
information into geospatial
products
and
services,
geographers have unique perspectives and methods to
contribute. This article is an effort to apply geographic
thinking to new geosocial technology creation and to
introduce a new method for geographers to use—as a
means of
expanding the options for qualitative GIS.
Although calls for a reimagining of
GIS in the late
1990s (Pickles 1995; Harris and Weiner 1998; Harvey
and Chrisman 1998;
Schuurman 2000) into a GIS/2
that
incorporated the voices
of
the people it
repre-
sented has not been possible,
incorporating methods
that use social media is one way to meet this goal.
We posit that emerging natural language processing
(NLP) techniques and qualitative visualizations are an
excellent
avenue for
interrogating qualitative data.
We introduce a method that uses social media data to
visualize topics
present
in the geosocial
landscape.
This
method gives
the user
the ability to integrate
large amounts of
textual
information in social
media
and express the topics contained within a map surface.
This method can be used at any spatial scale using any
textual qualitative data with location metadata.
Literature Review
Qualitative GIS
The
foundations
of
qualitative
GIS inquiry
are
traced
to
the
critical
GIS debates
of
the
1990s
(Schuurman 2000).
These debates
created a fissure
between quantitative
and nonquantitative
scholars
through heated discourse in journals forcing GIS as a
research niche to recognize that maps can be used to
disrupt
or
reify power
relationships
(Harley 1989).
Moreover, there were efforts to demonstrate that GIS
had largely ignored its potential to represent marginal-
ized people (Pickles 1995). As critical GIS as a subdis-
cipline moved forward,
new methods of
representing
people, places, and cultures evolved; indeed, participa-
tory methods led to the field of
Public Participatory
GIS and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)
(Chambers 1994;
Goodchild 2007;
Zook et al.
2010;
Sieber and Johnson 2013),
and critical conversations
that started with a reimagining of GIS for nonqualita-
tive means,
known as
GIS/2,
have led to studies
of
mixed
methods
and
qualitative
GIS
scholarship
(Sieber
2004;
Elwood 2008,
2009;
Halevy,
Norvig,
and Pereira 2009; Yeager and Steiger 2013).
Qualitative GIS has expanded to include multiple
meanings and multiple methodologies (Elwood 2008).
The original calls for GIS to be more than a quantita-
tive tool
(Curry 1994;
Pickles
1995;
Harvey,
Kwan,
and Pavlovskaya 2006;
Kwan and Ding 2008) have
been refined and spatial operations are now understood
as more than purely quantitative. Pavlovskaya (2009)
argued that overlay, a central component of all GIS, is
not a quantitative tool
at all
but rather a process of
qualitative observation. The geographic web (geoweb;
Haklay,
Singleton,
and Parker 2008) refines GIS fur-
ther as a conduit of qualitative GIS, directly integrat-
ing
qualitative information from diverse
groups
of
users.
Qualitative information increasingly accompa-
nies spatial
information in the modern geoweb,
and
with it the challenge has moved from data integration
to data analysis and visualization.
Using qualitative spatial
data—beyond raw data
presentation in Google Maps mashups (Miller 2006;
Crampton 2009)—is a difficult task. Analysis of quali-
tative data in human geography has
been improved
though the use of computer software (Richards 1999;
Bazeley and Jackson 2013),
but researchers continue
to rely on their intellect to review, think, and theorize
about
the
phenomena
they
observe
(Jung
2015;
Woods
et al.
2016).
Qualitative GIS scholars
have
made great strides to bridge the gap between GIS and
qualitative methods,
such as Jung’s (2007) CAQ-GIS
software
for
thematic
qualitative
coding
and code
clouds
(Jung 2015),
Kwan and Ding’s
geo-narrative
approach based on three-dimensional GIS (Kwan and
Ding 2008) that reveals intersecting lived experiences,
and Knigge and Cope’s (2006) grounded visualization
for iterative community participation in map making.
Analyzing
qualitative
information
from social
media
platforms
has
received increasing
attention
from GIS researchers. The interplay and entanglement
between qualitative
and quantitative
methods
are
important concerns,
where analysis of
social
patterns
(Jung 2015;
Shelton,
Poorthuis,
and Zook 2015) and
standard spatial
problems
(Goodchild 2007;
Crooks
et al.
2013;
Sieber
and Johnson 2013)
are studied
using similar
data sets.
Nonquantitative researchers
have increasingly turned to social
media as a source
Area-Based Topic Modeling and Visualization of Social Media
1029
for VGI analysis, focusing on what individuals say and
where they say it. This has led to better understanding
of the role of emotions during elections (Jung 2015),
urban inequality (Shelton, Poorthuis, and Zook 2015),
and how gender imbalances are reproduced in geoweb
applications (Stephens 2013).
Use of social media in social research has not come
without criticism.
Issues of access and representative-
ness
are key challenges
researchers
face.
The Pew
Research Center (Duggan 2015) estimates that only
23 percent of online adults and 20 percent of the gen-
eral public use Twitter.
Twitter appears more popular
with Hispanic and black Americans than white online
persons
(28 percent,
28 percent,
and 20 percent,
respectively) and most popular with younger persons
eighteen to forty-nine years of age. Twitter’s popularity
differs from the other social media by penetration,
as
Facebook commands a user base of
72 percent,
with
Pinterest at 28 percent and Instagram at 24 percent of
online Americans. Gaps in adoption have changed in
the last decade, however, showing that age and gender
gaps are shrinking, whereas the divide between urban
and rural
users and higher and lower income house-
holds remains (Perrin 2015). These reports do indicate
that there are some voices that are significantly less
present in social media postings, and results from using
this or any other method using social media should be
interpreted with this limitation in mind.
A challenge remains
for
geographers
using social
media for analysis to find a way to inductively explore
the ideas,
themes,
and topics present within massively
aggregated information while attempting to stay true to
the intent of those who produced the information. We
know that specific queries organize the results. In essence
the problem is allowing information to emerge from the
data—rather than asking specific questions that poten-
tially shape the answers—and using this information to
encourage further understanding of place.
Lessons from natural language researchers might be
a potential pathway for achieving a means of visualiz-
ing qualitative data rather than querying it.
Natural Language in Geography
Qualitative researchers
face a burden when using
social
media data.
In the age of
big data and social
media, information volumes have increased by several
orders of
magnitude over traditional
qualitative data
analysis. Increased data volumes require new methods,
as it has become impossible to continue reading every
data point (Jung 2015). Regular expressions and search
terms
can make it
easier
to find and identify social
media, but this limits analysis to the data that are specif-
ically searched for, as is the case in Shelton, Poorthuis,
and Zook (2015).
Count metrics gathered using this
type of analysis are useful, but they sacrifice the close-
ness between the researcher and data (Kwan 2016).
To deal with the tension between remaining close to
the meanings hidden in the data and the utility of large
data volumes, NLP was created to understand the mean-
ing of words in text (Allen 2003). The field has received
increasing
attention (Asghar
et al.
2014;
Kim and
Chen 2015;
Steiger,
de Albuquerque,
and Zipf 2015),
with two important branches that greatly increase the
capacity of qualitative data coding:
sentiment analysis
and topic
modeling
(Asghar
et al.
2014;
Ohmura,
Kakusho,
and Okadome 2014).
Sentiment analysis is
used to label
text containing an identifiable emotion
within it, and geographers have used this technique to
identify emotions
expressed in differing geographical
contexts (Robertson,
McLeman,
and Lawrence 2015).
Topic modeling also aims to label text,
but instead of
reading emotions it seeks to determine the topics of con-
versation (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003). In a geographical
context, topic models have been used to find topics at
the level of the city (Bauer et al. 2012) and topics dis-
persed across a landscape (Slingsby et al. 2007) and for
specific topic areas,
such as obesity (Ghosh and Guha
2013; Gore, Diallo, and Padilla 2015).
The topic model
used in this research is based on
the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model proposed
by Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003), cited by nearly 16,000
studies on Google Scholar at the time of writing. Since
its creation, several other models have been created on
top of
LDA,
such as
labeled LDA (L-LDA;
Daniel
et al. 2009). L-LDA seeks to generate names for each
topic that
is
generated by an LDA model.
In this
research, we left the interpretation of topic names for
the map up to readers.
Although topic modeling is
increasingly used for social
media analysis,
two chal-
lenges remain for geographers.
First,
topic models are
complex methods to implement and are sensitive to
parameter
settings.
Standard tools
do not
currently
exist for GIS scholars in either industry or open source
GIS. This inaccessibility has kept topic modeling from
being fully examined by geographers; as a result, a mul-
titude of
issues
such as
modifiable area units,
scale,
edge effects, landscape, and social process that geogra-
phers
are well
positioned to answer
have remained
unexplored
(Kitchin
2013;
Dalton
and
Thatcher
2015).
Second,
topic models
are difficult
to express
cartographically.
Studies
that
have
used

Martin and Schuurman
modeling
across
geographies
have
often presented
results
either
in tabulated form (Wang et al.
2007;
Mei
et al.
2008;
Ghosh and Guha 2013) or
as
dis-
persed clouds of words over general geographies of the
city (Slingsby et al. 2007). Instead, a method that vis-
ualizes the results of
topic modeling cartographically
would be useful so that map readers can easily compare
neighboring areas to one another,
illuminating differ-
ences and similarities over neighborhoods.
Methods
Creating an area-based topic model requires multi-
ple
components
of
varying
complexity.
To better
understand the process
of
creating area-based topic
models
(Figure 1),
we first
review the methodology
used in this study, involving (1) gathering social media
as a textual base for analysis,
(2) analyzing data using
topic models, and (3) visualization of results into GIS-
ready formats. These methodological steps are followed
by an explanation of programmatic specific methods.
Gathering Social Media
Maximizing Data within Rate Limitations
Conducting analysis on external social media data
requires careful
consideration of how to acquire rele-
vant information and store it for analysis. Using Twit-
ter data, researchers can connect to a data stream and
download large
amounts
of
information,
but
it
is
important to consider the exact nature of the data feed
to achieve optimal data flow.
Twitter imposes a rate limitation on the data they pro-
vide. An application using their social media stream can
only call for 1 percent of their global traffic—exceeding
causes of
interruptions to the data flow.
Additionally,
this research project focused explicitly on the 4 percent
of Twitter data containing geospatial locations in latitude
and longitude pairs. For this research project, a geospatial
boundary was placed around the amount of information
requested from the Twitter data stream. This limited the
amount of data requested and kept the database to a man-
ageable size while ensuring a near
100 percent
data
retrieval rate of geospatially referenced posts.
Data Retrieval and Storage
The Twitter data for this study were collected using an
HTTP GET request to the Twitter streaming endpoint
and stored in a PostGreSQL database. In the translation
from the Twitter stream to the database,
the data were
converted from the provided JavaScript object notation
(JSON) format to the POSTGreSQL table format and
included the following variables: name, username, date,
time,
self-reported location,
coordinates
(latitude and
longitude),
and tweet
text.
The table containing the
social media data also had spatial and textual indexes to
increase efficiency of data retrieval.
Topic Modeling
Following data retrieval, this study focused on creat-
ing methods
for
analyzing the social
information in
each post.
The primary method of
analysis used was
LDA,
a form of
topic modeling commonly used in
NLP (Blei,
Ng,
and Jordan 2003).
The use of
topic
models required the development of a Twitter dictio-
nary, determining optimal model parameters, and run-
ning the model within the context of spatial areas.
Corpus and Dictionary
NLP focuses on understanding meanings and attitudes
within a body of text.
The text analyzed could be one
large document or a collection of documents denoted as
a corpus. In this study, we used a corpus of 800 million
tweets, generated over a period of twenty months from
Figure 1.
Methodological process from data gathering to visualization.
Area-Based Topic Modeling and Visualization of Social Media
1031
February 2014 to October 2016 covering North Amer-
ica.
Vancouver neighborhoods accounted for 690,337
posts (Figure 2). From the corpus, a dictionary was cre-
ated that curtails the number of words considered by the
analysis to ensure that output refers to relevant topic
words
instead of
conjunctive and predicate forming
words (e.g., I, it, he, was, after, into, the, and, etc.). Two
rules were used to remove words from the dictionary: (1)
a list of non-topic-related words was formed, called stop
words,
and (2) any word appearing once in the corpus
was ignored.
The remaining words used in the corpus
after applying these two trimming rules became the dic-
tionary used in the LDA topic model.
Running the LDA Model for Spatial Areas
Once a corpus
and dictionary were set,
the LDA
model
was
configured and run.
Running the model
required two parameters, the number of topics and words
per topic, and the number of passes to iterate through the
corpus to look for topic words.
The number of
topics
changed the model results, so it was important to ensure
the number
of
topics
requested from the model
was
appropriate. The number of words per topic did not affect
the generation of topics but was an important consider-
ation for output table design. The number of passes for
the model to iterate over the corpus is an important con-
sideration for the LDA model, as it directly impacted the
predicted probability that any word does exist in a topic
at the cost of the computation time.
Several methods exist to introduce spatial context to
topic models (Yin et al.
2011;
Hong et al.
2012;
Liu
et al. 2015). This study eschews these, instead focusing
on incorporating topic modeling within traditional
GIS environments and well-known areal
units.
This
method creates a new topic model and creates indepen-
dent results for each spatial areal unit in the input land-
scape (Figure 3).
Approaching topic modeling from
this perspective requires a high density of social media
posts (alternatively, larger spatial areas or longer corpus
documents could be used) but ensures that the results
of the model can be compared directly with traditional
data sources,
such as census data or other area-based
data aggregate. Using areas, the results of this method
can be visualized onto geographical space, allowing for
a visual representation of social qualitative data.
Visualization of Topic Models
Producing
topic
model
results
for
spatial
areas,
although useful,
is difficult to understand without the
context
of
a visual
output
in Cartesian space.
This
research presents a method for visually conveying the
output of
the topic models simply,
within its spatial
context.
To do this,
tag clouds (often referred to as
wordles)
have been used.
Although tag clouds
are
Figure 2.
Tweet counts per Vancouver neighborhood.
1032
Martin and Schuurman
typically used with point-based data and word counts,
this
method optimizes
the placement
and sizing of
topic words and families within the areas they repre-
sent.
To convey the relative probability of
specific
words to be in specific topic families, font size has been
used.
To denote the membership of
a word within a
topic,
color has been employed.
Across spatial
areas,
font size was preserved,
so if
the topic model
in one
spatial
area is unable to predict words as strongly as
other areas,
the words in the area might not fill
the
entire space provided.
Color was assigned in order of
best to least predicted topic families,
where the best
predicted families will be the same color across spatial
areas.
Alternatively,
font
could be used to optimize
space filling, and color can be assigned randomly.
Programmatic Implementation
The preceding methodology was implemented using
the Python programming language and a conjunction
of
server
request,
database,
and image manipulation
modules.
Data
from Twitter
were
requested
using
OAUTH 2.0 credentials using programming and the
cURL Python module.
The data,
once received,
were
processed into Python objects using the JSON module
and reformatted into a format specific for storage into a
PostGreSQL database (PostgreSQL n.d.) with PostGIS
extensions (PostGIS n.d.).
Connections to the Post-
GreSQL database were facilitated by the Psycopg2 mod-
ule
(Varrazzo
2010).
The
LDA topic
model
was
implemented using the GENSIM module (

Rehu


rek and
Sojka n.d.),
and the intersection calculation of tweets
per spatial area was completed using an input shapefile
or
PostGIS geometry table and an SQL command.
Completing the intersection command using SQL dra-
matically
increased
performance
of
the
algorithm.
Finally, the visual tag clouds were initially based on the
examples of Rougier (2009) and adapted for this project.
Generation of
output
images
and manipulation of
multidimensional
arrays required pyCairo (pyCairo n.
d.) and NumPy (NumPy n.d.), respectively. The output
images were saved in TIFF format.
Results
Topic Modeling Tool for GIS
The first result of this research project was to create a
visual topic model that other researchers will be able to
use to carry out their own research on any textual data-
base that covers any geographical area. To this end, the
software is available online at http://www.github.com/
mikedotonline/VisualTopicModels.
Researchers
can
download the code therein and find instructions for
running the tool on data of their own. The code con-
sists
of
two modules:
one for
topic
modeling and
another
for
generating visual
representations
of
the
topic models.
The two modules can be used in con-
junction or separately.
Topic Models
The models run for this project generated five topic
families, with five words per topic, for each polygon in
the data set. Each of the twenty-five words generated is
accompanied by a probability score that indicates the
likelihood that each word is an element of the topic.
An example topic for a neighborhood in Vancouver
can be seen in Table 1. This model used fifty iterations,
producing five topic families, and recorded the top five
words. Each topic has been given a name by the authors.
The example used in Table 1 illustrates the topic fami-
lies in the Downtown neighborhood of Vancouver, an
area noted for the presence of the city sports stadium
and pubs as well
as the Downtown-Eastside (DTES).
The presence of
the stadium and the restaurants and
pubs can point to the abundance of landmarks, sports,
and alcohol
reflected in the model.
Additionally,
the

DTES is known for its low socioeconomic status (SES)
indicators (Bell et al. 2007) and high level of pedestrian
injury
(Walker,
Schuurman,
and
Hameed
2014).
Although landmarks are present in many of the neigh-
borhood topic models, alcohol, and specifically watch-
ing
sports
in
alcohol-serving
establishments,
is
prominent
in the
Downtown neighborhood topics.
Although connections between low SES,
injury,
and
alcohol are established (van Oers et al. 1999; Burrows
et al.
2012;
Redonnet
et al.
2012;
Bonevski
et al.
2014),
it is important to understand that the implica-
tions of the results of this topic model warrant further
investigation that is outside the scope of this research.
Image Output
The results displayed in Table 1 demonstrate typi-
cal output from a single neighborhood, but the spatial
topic model was run over the entire geography of Van-
couver, Canada. During this run, the model produced
a similar table of
data for each Vancouver neighbor-
hood (twenty-four neighborhoods),
five topic families
for each (120 families),
and five words in each topic
(600 topic words). Each of these words was then writ-
ten onto the Vancouver landscape,
within its respec-
tive neighborhoods. The final output of this yielded an
8 MB image, 10,000 £ 10,000 pixels in size (Figure 4).
Discussion
Topic modeling and visualization are complex pro-
cedures. When used correctly, these methods have the

ability to provide insight
into the ever
larger
data
stores.
The complexity of topic modeling and visuali-
zation and the decisions
that
are made during their
usage can,
however,
make it
difficult
to understand
what exactly is shown on the map canvas.
Topic modeling has several input parameters,
itera-
tions,
number
of
topics,
dictionary,
corpus,
and stop
words
(Blei,
Ng,
and Jordan 2003).
Adding spatial
dimensions introduces more variables that affect model
outcome. In the results presented here, the topic models
are
formed using
the
social
media
items
collected
within. It is impossible to know at face value, however,
whether the topics reference the issues that persons liv-
ing in the place face or whether the topics are those of a
more transient crowd.
For example,
in the Vancouver
neighborhood including Granville Island (Figure 5),
a
very tourist-heavy area,
the best
predicted topic is
“Granville,” “Island,” and “Brewery,” which is not sur-
prising given the crowds of tourists that flock there on
vacation and the draw of a brewery. Can we draw the
conclusion that social interests of the place are about
breweries,
or is the effect of tourism drowning out the
signal of residents’
interests? Similarly, events that pro-
mote the use of social media can alter the topics that
are posted.
For example,
in the Downtown neighbor-
hood of
the convention center,
we see various words
relating to specific conferences bubbling up.
This,
no
doubt,
can be controlled by integrating temporal con-
trols on topic models, but effective temporal scales and
filters are not necessarily evident before running a topic
model
and viewing the output.
Complicating matters
further, the filters used in one spatial area might not be
appropriate for another.
Computer scientists have cre-
ated
methods
for
checking
if
topics
are
trending
(Bolelli, Ertekin, and Giles 2009; Becker, Naaman, and
Gravano 2011), but this adds additional complexity to
an already difficult process and could hide topics impor-
tant to researchers.
In short,
geographic topic models
require flexibility to deal
with a number of
scenarios,
while still maintaining clarity in their operation.
Geography also plays a role in dividing—or uniting—
populations of users and social media posts present in the
data.
Any area-based approach to modeling data will
introduce edge effects and the consequence of modifiable
area units (Paez and Scott 2005). Complicating this issue
further is the nature of user mobility. Is the content of a
tweet influenced by the location from which the user is
tweeting? This is a central
concern for an area-based
approach, as it entangles the chicken and the egg: Did
the location bring about the tweet, or do people of this
place tweet about that topic in a particular way? These
two positions
are ontologically different
and make a
qualitative analysis of location much more difficult.
Area units, as they unite and divide, beg this ques-
tion:
Are
they
the
most
relevant
(Dalton
and
Thatcher 2015)? Neighborhoods and census divisions
logically appear as the most salient places to start,
as
they are laid out both quantifiably and culturally to be
homogenously distinct (Morphet 1993). Computer sci-
ence has attempted to challenge area-based methods,
such as using Voronoi
polygons (Hecht et al.
2011),
but frequency of topic words per unit area is frequently
used (Hao et al. 2010; Ghosh and Guha 2013). Using
choropleth maps to show the varied data of qualitative

ration of topics by color and relative probability scores by size of word. (Color figure available online.)
Area-Based Topic Modeling and Visualization of Social Media

information,
however,
hides the richness of
the lan-
guage used in each topic.
Areal units also have the effect of hiding the distribu-
tion of tweets inside them. In this case study, the num-
ber of tweets per area varied from 2,610 to 191,415. A
lower number of tweets per area will result in less reli-
able topic prediction.
This makes area unit selection
important
for
two reasons.
First,
readers
of
the map
need to be made aware of the discrepancy between the
highest tweet count areas and the lowest. Adding back-
ground shading to indicate the relative tweets was con-
sidered for this method, but it was ultimately not used,
as the resulting images became too complex. The sec-
ond issue concerning tweet counts and areal units is to
ensure that the correct scale is used.
When the areal
unit was smaller than the neighborhood level, the effect
of data density was magnified as some areas had too little
data to be adequate predictors of topics. When the area
units were much larger than neighborhoods,
the topic
model suffered from becoming too generic, offering lit-
tle information about place. With larger area units, this
method might be more appropriate with limiting tweets
and topics to a narrower temporal resolution.
Visualizing topic model results engages with the core
of these concerns and more, as they are made in an effort
to convey the information in a particular way to the
reader.
Choices
concerning word color,
size,
texture,
font,
positioning,
collisions,
orientation,
and other fac-
tors all affect the way that the map will be read by its
intended audience (Monmonier 1996).
In producing a
geographic visualization of topic modeling results,
each
of these choices must be kept in mind. Specifically, the
connection between a set of visualized words and geogra-
phy is of primary importance. To visualize this relation-
ship, previous studies using topic models have produced
topic model
results beside the geographies (Kling and
Pozdnoukhov 2012) or simply show relative frequency of
a topic per
area (Hao et al.
2010;
Ghosh and Guha
2013). In this research, however, the words that make up
topic models
and their
relative probabilities
are pre-
sented directly on the areas they represent, providing the
map reader with both results and context. Drawing words
on the map like this requires the reader to be aware of
how the map was produced,
but that is a concern with
all
cartographic visualizations (Monmonier 1996).
It is
hoped that with the full explanation given earlier,
the
reader will understand the choices made and the alterna-
tives that could have been used.
Future Work
In creating
a visual
topic model,
we recognize
that
this
is
only a first
step toward integrating the
benefits
of
NLP
into
the
familiar
workspaces

GIScientists use.
It is our hope to integrate the two
primary components in this work,
topic models and
the visualization thereof,
into a tool
that
can be
integrated with modern GIS,
presenting
the
user
with options
to tweak and change the parameters
of
the model
and the visualization.
Opportunities
also exist
to make the visualization process
more
interactive,
allowing the cartographer
more choice
over
word placement
and the recipient
of
the map
an ability to interact
with the word families
dis-
played,
instead of
the static nature of
images
cur-
rently produced.
Additionally,
there are a number
of
other
tools
that
natural
language
has
to offer
GIScientists
and geographers,
which we
hope
to
develop and integrate,
including theme-based topic
models
(e.g.,
looking specifically at
health,
crime,
leisure,
etc.) and predictive modeling.
Conclusion
In this article we have brought two novel methods
to the fore:
geographic topic modeling and visualiza-
tion of
qualitative information resulting from topic
models.
These methods
were used to create a topic
model
for
each neighborhood in Vancouver
using a
corpus
of
social
media postings
from Twitter
users.
These geographic topic models
have been used as
input
data for
the visualization method developed,
rendering topics by color and probability by word size
(Figure 4).
These visualizations were saved as
image
files
that
can be used with traditional
GIS software
(Figure 6).
The realization of
these methods opens a
new avenue for qualitative researchers to probe at big
qualitative data sets,
where the burden of
reading
every data point is no longer feasible.
Over the past
decade,
there has
been a sustained call
to include
qualitative techniques
in GIS analysis
and output.
When first articulated,
these calls were bordering on
utopian because tools to implement qualitative analy-
sis
were largely absent.
Since then,
there has
been
increasing attention paid to methods of
implementa-
tion for
qualitative GIS.
This
article offers
another
tool to achieve the goal of a more inclusive and qual-
itative GIS environment.
It is hoped that over time,
the methods featured in this article can become stan-
dard tools in modern GIS environments.
Integration
of methods from NLP and computer science is partic-
ularly well
suited to pushing the frontiers of
qualita-
tive GIS and providing new avenues of research to be
explored.
