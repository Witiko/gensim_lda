Finding Street Gang Member Profiles on Twitter
The crime and violence street gangs introduce into neighborhoods is a growing
epidemic in cities around the world.
Today,
over 1.4 million people,
belonging to
more than 33,000 gangs,
are active in the United States,
of
which 88% identify
themselves as being members of a street gang.
With the recent popularity of social
media, street gang members have established online presences coinciding with their
physical
occupation of
neighborhoods.
Recent studies report that approximately
45% of gang members participate in online offending activities such as threatening,
harassing individuals, posting violent videos or attacking someone on the street for
something they said online in social media platforms.
Thus, their social media posts
may be useful to social workers and law enforcement agencies to discover clues about
recent crimes or to anticipate ones that may occur in a community.
Finding these
posts,
however,
requires a method to discover gang member social
media profiles.
This is a challenging task since gang members represent a very small
population
compared to the active social media user base.
This thesis studies the problem of automatically identifying street gang member
profiles on Twitter, which is a popular social media platform that is commonly used
by street gang members to promote their online gang-related activities.
It outlines
a process to curate one of the largest sets of verifiable gang member Twitter profiles
iii
that have ever been studied.
A review of these profiles establishes differences in the
language, profile and cover images, YouTube links, and emoji shared on Twitter by
gang members compared to the rest of the Twitter population.
Beyond the earlier
efforts in Twitter profile identification that utilize features derived from the profile
and tweet text,
this thesis uses additional
heterogeneous sets of
features from the
emoji
usage,
profile images,
and links to YouTube videos reflecting gang-related
music
culture
towards
solving the
gang member
profile
identification problem.
Features from this review are used to train a series of supervised machine learning
classifiers and they are further improved upon by using word embeddings learned
over a large corpus of tweets.
Experimental results demonstrate that heterogeneous
features enabled our classifiers to achieve low false positive rates and promising
F 1-scores.

Introduction
The crime and violence street gangs introduce into neighborhoods is a growing
epidemic in cities around the world
1
.
Today,
over 1.4 million people in the United
States are members of a street gang [2, 3], which is “a self-formed association of peers,
united by mutual
interests,
with identifiable leadership and internal
organization,
who act
collectively or
as
individuals
to achieve specific purposes,
including the
conduct
of
illegal
activity and control
of
a territory,
facility,
or
enterprise”
[4].
They promote criminal
activities
such as
drug trafficking,
assault,
robbery,
and
threatening or intimidating a neighborhood [3].
Moreover,
data from the Centers
for Disease Control in the United States suggests that the victims of at least 1.3% of
all gang-related
2
homicides are merely innocent bystanders who live in gang occupied
neighborhoods [5].
Street gang members have established online presences coinciding with their
physical occupation of neighborhoods.
The National Gang Threat Assessment Report
confirms that at least tens of thousands of gang members are using social networking
websites such as Twitter and video sharing websites such as YouTube in their daily
life [2].
They are very active online;
the 2007 National
Assessment Center’s survey
of gang members found that 25% of individuals in gangs use the Internet for at least
4 hours a week [6].
More recent studies report approximately 45% of gang members
participate in online offending activities such as threatening,
harassing individuals,
posting violent videos or attacking someone on the street for something they said

The terms ‘gang’ and ‘street gang’ are used interchangeably in this thesis.
1
online [7, 8].
This “Cyber-”
or “Internet banging”
[9] behavior is precipitated by the
fact that an increasing number of young members of the society are joining gangs [10],
and these young members have become enamored with technology and with the notion
of
sharing information quickly and publicly through social
media
3
.
Stronger police
surveillance in the physical
spaces where gangs congregate further encourages gang
members to seek out virtual
spaces such as social
media to express their affiliation,
to sell drugs, and to celebrate their illegal activities [11].
Past research has shown that social media play an essential role in illicit activities
carried out by street gang members [12, 13].
For example,
street gang members use
social
media as a platform to threaten their rival
gangs,
sell
drugs,
publicize crimes
to gain online reputation and to recruit new gang members [7, 14, 12, 13].
Figure 1.1
depicts a complete list of illicit activities carried out by street gangs as per the 2015
National Gang Report [1].
It further reports that the social media use of street gang
members is on the rise.
For example, it reports that over 90% of street gang members
have used Facebook at least once in 2015 (See Figure 1.2).
Among other popular
social media websites, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter have also received attention
of the gang members.
For example,
close to 80% of street gang members have used
YouTube in 2015 where as Instagram and Twitter have been used by more than
60% of
them.
Gang members publicly share their activities on these social
media
websites.
However,
sites such as Facebook
4
and Instagram
5
do not allow the use of
user-generated data for further aggregated analysis without the user’s consent, even if
the data is publicly available.
On the other hand, publicly available data on Twitter
can be used for aggregated analysis as long as personally identifiable information
related to a user is not revealed in the analysis.

Gang members are able to post publicly on Twitter without fear of consequences
because there are few tools law enforcement can use to surveil
this medium [15].
Their
posts provides live updates on gang activity and can be leveraged by law
enforcement and social
workers to identify problem areas and send workers in to
conflict mediation [16].
Police departments across the United States instead rely
on manual
processes to search social
media for gang member profiles and to study
their posts.
For example,
the New York City police department employs over 300
detectives to combat teen violence triggered by insults, dares, and threats exchanged
on social
media,
and the
Toronto police
department
teaches
officers
about
the
use of
social
media in investigations
[17].
Officer
training is
broadly limited to
understanding policies on using Twitter in investigations and best practices for data
storage [18].
From offline clues, the officers monitor just a selected set of social media
accounts which are manually discovered and related to a specific investigation.
Thus,
developing tools to identify gang member profiles on social media is an important step
4
in the direction of using machine intelligence to fight crime.
The safety and security
of
city neighborhoods can thus be improved if
law enforcement was equipped with
intelligent tools to study social media for gang activity.
The need for better tools for law enforcement and social
workers cannot be
underscored enough.
Recent news reports have shown that many incidents involving
gangs start on Twitter, escalate over time, and lead to an offline event that could have
been prevented by an early warning.
For example, the media reported on a possible
connection between the death of
the Englewood,Chicago’s teenage rapper Joseph
Coleman also known as Lil Jojo and the final set of tweets he posted.
One of his last
tweets linked to a video of him shouting vulgar words at a rival gang member who, in
return, replied “I’ma kill you” on social media
6
.
In Coleman’s subsequent tweets, he
posted “im on 069” and revealed his location, and minutes later, was shot dead on the
6900 block of
South Princeton Avenue in the Englewood neighborhood of
Chicago.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the rivalry leading to his death began and was
carried out entirely on social media.
[19] have studied Twitter communication of one
known female gang member in Chicago, Gakirah Barnes, during a two week window
in which her friend was killed and then weeks later, she was also killed.
They observed
how the street culture is reflected in gang related tweets and also found that scripts of
reciprocal violence within a local network have real world consequences that resemble
street gang behavior [19, 16].
Other reporting has revealed how innocent bystanders
have also become targets in online fights,
leaving everyone in the neighborhood at
risk
7
.
This
thesis
investigates
whether
gang
member
profiles
can
be
identified
automatically on Twitter,
which can enable better surveillance of gang members on
social media.
Classifying Twitter profiles into particular types of users has been done

Figure 1.3:
Twitter profile descriptions of known gang members.
Pursuant to an IRB governing human subject research, we are prohibited from revealing personally
identifiable information in this thesis.
We only report Twitter handles that have already been
revealed in widely reported publications and were not collected by the research team for this work.
in other contexts [20, 21, 22], but gang member profiles pose unique challenges.
For
example,
many Twitter profile classifiers search for contextual
clues in tweets and
profile descriptions [23],
but gang member profiles use a rapidly changing lexicon
of
keywords and phrases that often have only a local,
geographic context.
This is
illustrated in Figure 1.3, which shows the Twitter profile descriptions of two verified
deceased gang members.
The profile of @OsoArrogantJoJo provides evidence that he
belongs to a rival gang of the Black Disciples by #BDK, a hashtag that is only known
to those involved with gang culture in Chicago.
@PappyNotPapi’s profile mentions
#PBG and our investigations revealed that this hashtag is newly founded and stands
for the Pooh Bear Gang,
a gang that was formerly known as the Insane Cutthroat
Gangsters.
Given the very local, rapidly changing lexicon of gang members on social
media,
building a database of keywords,
phrases,
and other identifiers to find gang
members nationally is not feasible.
Instead,
this thesis proposes heterogeneous sets
of
features derived not only from profile and tweet text but also from the emoji
usage,
profile images,
and links to YouTube videos reflecting their music culture.
6
A large set
of
gang member
profiles,
obtained through a careful
data collection
process,
is compared against non-gang member profiles to find contrasting features.
Experimental evaluation under various learning algorithms demonstrated a low false
positive rate and a promising F 1-score of 0.7755 for using these sets of features.
Motivated by the recent success of
word embeddings-based methods to learn
syntactic and semantic structures automatically when provided with large datasets,
we then investigate the use of
word embeddings to further improve our classifiers.
Specifically,
we train a Skip-gram model
using a large Twitter corpus and generate
word embeddings
that
translate the features
into a real
vector
format
amenable
for machine learning classification and use them to train another set of
supervised
classifiers.
We show that pre-trained word embeddings improve the machine learning
models we developed earlier and help us obtain an F 1-score of 0.7835 on identifying
gang member profiles (a 6.39% improvement in F 1-score compared to the baseline
models which were not trained using word embeddings).

Related Work
This chapter discusses research studies that are related to the work presented in
this thesis.
We first discuss the research related to the social media usage among street
gang members.
In particular,
we discuss several
studies that built applications to
understand the activities of street members on Twitter.
Then we discuss a selected set
of studies that aimed at building Twitter profile classification models and emphasize
how our approach differs from the other approaches presented prior to our work.
Finally, we briefly discuss research on word embedding models and how they can be
used for text classification tasks.
We also highlight how our work differs from the
existing approaches that use word embeddings for text classification.
2.1
Social Media Use of Street Gang Members
Gang violence is a well
studied social
science topic dating back to 1927 [24]
while the existence of criminal gangs in America dates back to 1760 [25].
Historical
reviews portray American gangs emerging along racial and ethnic lines and developing
into organizations designed for illegal business including drug and weapon trafficking,
prostitution, human trafficking etc. [25].
However, the notions of “Cyber-” or “Internet
banging”,
which is defined as “the phenomenon of
gang affiliates using social
media
sites to trade insults or make violent threats that lead to homicide or victimization” [9],
was only recently introduced [26, 15].
Patton et al.
[26]
were the first to introduce the concept of
“Internet banging”
and they studied how social media is being used as a tool for gang self-promotion and
10
gaining and maintaining street credibility [9].
They also discussed the relationship
between gang-related crime and hip-hop culture,
giving examples on how hip-hop
music shared on social
media websites targeted at harassing rival
gang members
often ended up in real-world collisions among those gangs.
Decker et al.
and Patton
et
al.
have also reported that street gangs perform Internet banging with social
media posts of
videos depicting their illegal
behaviors,
threats to rival
gangs,
and
firearms [7,
14].
Past research also reveals that gang members use social
platforms
to recruit new members to their gangs.
For example,
a recent study by Pyrooz et
al. [12] that interviewed 418 current and former gang members reports that 8% of the
participants had stated that their gangs recruited new individuals online.
Morselli
et al. [13]
reported that gang members use the Internet and social
networking sites
as much,
if
not more,
than their non-gang counterparts and gang members have a
greater overall
propensity for online crime and deviance than former and non-gang
respondents.
The ability to take action upon gang members’ activity on social media is limited
by the tools available to discover gang members on social media sites and to analyze
the content they post [26].
Recent attempts to improve the abilities of
analyzing
social media posts by gang members include a proposed architecture for a surveillance
system that can learn the structure,
function,
and operation of gangs through what
they post on social
media [15].
The proposed surveillance system,
which extends
the Twitris social media platform [27], had four design goals aimed at understanding
gang member posts, namely, (i) monitor negative community effects of gang activities,
(ii) discover opinion leaders who influence the thoughts and actions of
other gang
members, (iii) evaluate the sentiment of posts targeting communities, locations, and
groups (including rival
gangs),
and (iv) monitor community and gang responses to
community support programs.
The designers of the surveillance system argued that
it should be able to analyze the spatio-temporal-thematic (where,when,
and what),
11
people-content-networking (who and how),
and emotion-sentiment (perceptions and
intent) dimensions of social media posts in order to support the proposed design goals.
However, the said architecture requires a set of gang member profiles for input, thus
assuming that they have already been discovered.
Patton et al. [14] devised a method to automatically collect tweets from a group
of gang members operating in Detroit, MI. They manually identified Twitter profiles
belong to known street gang members who operate in the Detroit area and then used
keywords related to crime and violence to further filter out tweets posted by them.
Similar to Wijeratne et
al.
[15],
this approach requires the Twitter profile names
of the gang members to be known beforehand,
and data collection was localized to
a single city in the country.
In another study that examined how gang members
use social
media,
Decary-Hetu et
al.
[28]
used 28 keywords which are related to
U.S.
and Canada-based gangs to collect tweets and Facebook posts that discussed
their gang-related activities.
They reported that there has been an increase in social
media use by gang members and the amount of information being shared online on
gang activities.
Decary-Hetu et
al.’s [28]
data collection approach was also based
on pre-identified gang names that are specific to a set of to U.S. and Canadian cities
where a large number of gangs operate.
Radil et al. [29] studied the rivalry network of
Los Angeles-based street gangs using social
network analysis techniques.
Piergallini
et al.
[30]
studied the graffiti
style features used by street gang members in online
Web forums to develop methods to distinguish their gang affiliation.
Radil et al. [29]’s
approach is only limited to street gangs operating in Los Angeles while Piergallini et
al. [30]’s is limited to twelve gangs which include Bloods,
Crips,
Hoovers,
Gangster
Disciples, other Folk Nation, Latin Kings, Vice Lords, Black P. Stones, other People
Nation, Trinitarios, Norteños, and Sureños.
The work reported in this thesis differs from the related research discussed above
12
in two ways.
Firstly, we propose a location-agnostic method to collect Twitter profiles
of
the street gang members.
Instead of
using gang names as keywords to search
for Twitter profiles or manually identifying street gang members’
Twitter handles,
we use hashtags that are commonly used by street gang members across U.S.
to
(i) support their fellow members who are in jail
(e.g.,
#FreeDaGuys),
(ii) convey
the grieving for fallen gang members (e.g., #RIPDaGuys), and (iii) show their hatred
towards police officers (e.g., #FuckDaOpps).
By doing so, we were able to create a gang
members dataset that is not specific to a particular city or neighborhood.
Secondly,
this thesis uses additional heterogeneous sets of features than to what is proposed in
earlier studies in the classification models.
For example, we extract features from the
emoji usage, profile images, and links to YouTube videos reflecting gang-related music
culture in addition to features extracted from tweets and Twitter profile descriptions.
Experimental results demonstrate that heterogeneous features enabled our classifiers
to achieve low false positive rates and promising F 1-scores.
2.2
Twitter User Profile Classification
Twitter user profile classification is a well-studied problem where a class label is
assigned to a Twitter profile from a set of
pre-defined labels.
Concrete examples
of
Twitter
profile classification include user
political
affiliation classification [20],
ethnicity classification [20],
gender identification [22],
brand loyalty prediction [20],
and user
occupation classification [23].
Majority of
these applications
rely only
on textual
features
extracted from content
posted on Twitter
or
user
profiles.
Pennacchiotti
et al. [20]
proposed a machine learning framework to classify Twitter
profiles
by using the
Twitter
user
profile
description,
user’s
tweeting behavior,
linguistic
content
of
tweets
and
user’s
follower/followee
network
as
features.
Pennacchiotti
et
al.
showed that
their
framework can be used to identify user
attributes such as a user’s ethnicity,
political
affiliation or brand loyalty.
Liu et
13
al.
[22]
tried to incorporate user’s self-reported first name into a gender classifier
and showed that,
when combined with other textual
features obtained from tweets,
first name can improve the gender classification of Twitter users.
Purohit et al. [23]
developed a method to generate user summaries or ‘User Tag Lines’ for Twitter users
based on the content posted on their Twitter profiles.
They utilized Twitter profile
description-based features along with features extracted from tweets (e.g.,
entities
present in tweets and word phrases) to generate user summaries, which could then be
used in a user profile classification task.
The
work
reported
in
this
thesis
builds
upon
the
existing
methods
to
automatically classify Twitter profiles.
Unlike the above approaches that utilize an
abundance of positive examples in their training data,
and only rely on one or two
feature types
8
(typically, tweet text and profile description), we consider the use of a
variety of feature types, including emoji, YouTube links, and image features.
We show
that integrating multiple types of features could significantly improve the classification
accuracy of gang member Twitter profile classification problem.
2.3
Word Embedding Models
In addition to using a diverse set of feature types,
this thesis also explores the
possibility of further improving Twitter profile classification results by mapping the
above identified features types into a considerably smaller feature space through the
use of word embeddings.
A word embedding model is a neural network that learns rich
representations of words in a text corpus.
It takes data from a large,
n-dimensional
‘word space’
(where n is the number of
unique words in a corpus) and learns a
transformation of the data into a lower k-dimensional space of real-valued numbers.
This transformation is developed in a way that similarities between the k-dimensional
8
The terms ’feature type’ and ’content type’ are used interchangeably in this thesis.
These terms
refer to the different types of content used for feature extraction.
14
vector representation of two words reflects semantic relationships among the words
themselves.
These semantics are not captured by typical
bag-of-words or n-gram
models for classification tasks on text data [31, 32].
Word embeddings have led to state-of-the-art results in many natural
language
processing tasks [33].
In fact, word embedding learning is an important step for many
statistical language modeling tasks in text processing systems.
Bengio et al.
were the
first ones to introduce the idea of learning a distributed representation for words over
a text corpus [34].
They learned representations for each word in the word corpus
using a neural
network model
that modeled the joint probability function of
word
sequences in terms of
the feature vectors of
the words in the sequence.
Mikolov et
al.
showed that word embeddings learned over a text corpus can be used to perform
simple algebraic operations on them, which leads to findings such as word embedding
vector of the word “King” − the word embedding vectors of “Man” + “Woman” would
results in a word embedding vector that is closest to the word embedding vector of
the word “Queen”
[31].
Recent successes in using word embeddings to improve text
classification for short text [35,
36],
encouraged us to explore how they can be used
to improve gang and non-gang member Twitter profile classification.
Word embeddings can be performed under different neural network architectures;
two
popular
ones
are
the
Continuous
Bag-of-Words
(CBOW)
and Continuous
Skip-gram (Skip-gram) models [37].
The CBOW model learns a neural network such
that given a set of context words surrounding a target word, it predict a target word.
The Skip-gram model
differs by predicting context words given a target word and
by capturing the ordering of word occurrences.
Recent improvements to Skip-gram
model
make it better able to handle less frequent words,
especially when negative
sampling is used [32].
Previous
research has
shown word embedding-based methods
can improve
15
classification of
short text [35,
36].
Thus,
we investigate using word embeddings
to further improve the process of identifying gang member profiles on Twitter.
We
believe our corpus of
gang and non-gang member tweets,
with nearly 64.6 million
word tokens, could act as a rich resource to train word embeddings for distinguishing
gang and non-gang member Twitter users.
Our method differs from other word
embedding-based text classification systems such as [35,
36]
due to the fact that
we use a set of
heterogeneous features including emojis in tweets and image tags
extracted from profile and cover
images available in Twitter
in our
classification
task [38].
Experimental results demonstrate that heterogeneous features enabled our
classifiers to achieve low false positive rates and promising F 1-scores.

Data Curation
This
section discusses
the methodology we followed to create the gang and
non-gang member datasets we used in our study.
It includes a semi-automatic data
collection process to discover one of the largest sets of verifiable gang member Twitter
profiles that have ever been studied.
3.1
Gang Member Data collection
Discovering gang member
profiles
on Twitter
to build training and testing
datasets is a challenging task.
Past strategies to find these profiles were to search
for keywords,
phrases,
and events that are known to be related to gang activity
in a particular city a priori
[15,
14].
For example,
Wijeratne et
al.
[15]
studied
Chicago-based street gangs based on a Twitter profile dataset collected using local
street gang names.
Patton et al. [14] studied Detroit-based street gangs by manually
identifying the
gang members’
Twitter
profiles.
However,
such approaches
are
unlikely to yield adequate data to train an automatic classifier since gang members
from different geographic locations and cultures use local languages, location-specific
hashtags,
and share information related to activities in a local
region [15].
Such
region-specific tweets
and profiles
may be used to train a classifier
to find gang
members within a small region but not across the Twitterverse.
To overcome these limitations,
we adopted a semi-automatic workflow to build
a dataset of
gang member profiles suitable for training a classifier.
The steps of
the workflow are:
(i) seed term discovery, (ii) gang affiliated rappers’ Twitter profile
17
discovery, (iii) manual verification of Twitter profiles, (iv) using retweets to discover
gang member Twitter profiles, and (v) using followers and followees to discover gang
member Twitter profiles.
The workflow is illustrated in Figure 3.1 and each step of
the workflow is discussed in detail below.

Gang member dataset creation.
3.1.1
Seed Term Discovery
Following the success of identifying gang member profiles from Chicago [15], we
began our data collection with discovering universal
terms used by gang members.
We first searched for profiles with hashtags for Chicago gangs noted in [15],
namely
#BDK (Black Disciple Killers) and #GDK (Gangster Disciples Killers).
Those profiles
were analyzed and manually verified as explained in subsection 3.1.3.
Analysis of these profiles identified a small
set of hashtags they all
use in their
profile descriptions.
Searching Twitter profiles using those hashtags, we observed that
gang members across the U.S. use them, thus we consider those terms to be location
neutral.
For example,
gang members post #FreeDaGuys in their profile to support
their fellow members who are in jail,
#RIPDaGuys to convey the grieving for fallen
18
gang members,
and #FuckDaOpps to show their hatred towards police officers.
We
used these terms as keywords to discover Twitter profiles irrespective of geographical
location.
We used the Followerwonk Web service API
9
and Twitter REST API
10
to search
Twitter profile descriptions by keywords #FreeDaGuys,
#FreeMyNigga,
#RIPDaGuys,
and #FuckDaOpps.
Since there are different informal ways people spell a word in social
media, we also considered variations on the spelling of each keyword; for example, for
#FreeDaGuys, we searched both #FreeDaGuys, and #FreeTheGuys.
3.1.2
Gang Affiliated Rappers’ Twitter Profile Discovery
Finding profiles by a small
set of
keywords is unlikely to yield sufficient data.
Thus,
we sought additional
gang member profiles with an observation from Patton
et
al.
[9]
that the influence of
hip-hop music and culture on offline gang member
activities can also be seen in their social
media posts.
We thus also consider the
influence of hip-hop culture on Twitter by exploring the Twitter network of known
gangster rappers who were murdered in 2015 due to gang-related incidents
11
.
We
searched for these rapper profiles on Twitter and manually checked that the rapper
was affiliated to a gang.
3.1.3
Manual verification of Twitter profiles
We verified each profile discovered manually by examining the profile picture,
profile background image,
recent tweets,
and recent pictures posted by the user.
During these checks, we searched for terms, activities, and symbols that we believed
could be associated with a gang including self-identification of gang affiliation in their
9

11
http://www.hipwiki.com/List+of+Rappers+Murdered+in+2015
19
Twitter profiles.
For example, profiles whose image or background included guns in a
threatening way, stacks of money, showing gang hand signs and gestures, and humans
holding or posing with a gun,
appeared likely to be from a gang member.
Such
images were often identified in profiles of
users who submitted tweets that contain
messages of support or sadness for prisoners or recently fallen gang members, or used
a high volume of threatening and intimidating slang language.
Only profiles where the
images, words, and tweets all suggested gang affiliation were labeled as gang affiliates
and added to our dataset.
Although this manual verification does have a degree of subjectivity, in practice,
the images and words used by gang members on social media are so pronounced that
we believe any reasonable analyst would agree that they are gang members.
We found
that not all
the profiles collected belonged to gang members;
we observed relatives
and followers of
gang members posting the same hashtags as in Step 1 to convey
similar feelings in their profile descriptions.
3.1.4
Using Retweets to discover more profiles
From the set of verified profiles, we explored their retweet and follower networks
as a way to expand the dataset.
We first considered authors of
tweets which were
retweeted by a gang member in our seed set.
In Twitter, “retweeting” is a mechanism
by which a user can share someone else’s tweet to their follower audience.
Assuming
that a user only retweets things that they believe or their audience would be interested
in,
it may be reasonable to assume that gang members would only be interested
in sharing what other gang members have to say,
and hence,
the authors of
gang
members’ retweets could also be gang members.
20
3.1.5
Using Followers and Followees to discover more profiles
We analyzed followers and followees of
our seed gang member profiles to find
more gang member profiles.
A Twitter user can follow other Twitter users so that the
individual will be subscribed to their tweets as a follower and they will be able to start
a private conversation by sending direct messages to the individual.
Motivated by
the sociological concept of homophily, which claims that individuals have a tendency
to associate and bond with similar others
12
,
we hypothesized that the followers and
followees of Twitter profiles from the seed set may also be gang members.
However,
manual verification of Twitter profiles collected from retweets, followers, and followees
of
gang members showed that a majority of
those profiles are non-gang members
who are either family members, hip-hop artists, women or profiles with pornographic
content.
To ensure that our dataset is not biased towards a specific gang or geographic
location, only a limited number of profiles were collected via retweets, followers and
followees.
Table 3.1 summarizes the number of profiles manually verified as gang members
from Twitter profiles collected in step 1, 2, 4 and 5.
Altogether we collected 400 gang
member’s Twitter profiles.
This is a large number compared to previous studies of
gang member activities on social media that curated a maximum of 91 profiles [15].
Moreover,
we believe the profiles collected represent a diverse set of gang members
that are not biased toward a particular geographic area or lingo as our data collection
process used location-independent terms proven to be used by gang members when
they express themselves.

Non-Gang Member Data collection
For this study,
profiles of
non-gang members were collected from the Twitter
Streaming API
13
.
We first collected a random sample of
tweets and retrieved the
profiles of
the users who authored the tweets in the random sample.
We manually
verified that
all
Twitter
profiles
collected in this
approach belong to non-gang
members.
The profiles selected were then filtered by location to remove non-U.S.
profiles by reverse geo-coding the location stated in their profile description by the
Google Maps API
14
. Profiles with location descriptions that were unspecified or did
not relate to a location in the U.S. were discarded.
We collected 2,000 non-gang member profiles in this manner.
In addition,
we
added 865 manually verified non-gang member profiles collected using the location
neutral
keywords discussed in section 3.1.3.
Introducing these profiles,
which have
some characteristics of gang members (such as cursing frequently or cursing at law
enforcement) but are not,
captures local
languages used by family/friends of
gang
members and ordinary people in a neighborhood where gangs operate.

Dataset
Using the Twitter REST API
15
,
we collected the maximum number of
most
recent tweets that can be retrieved (3,200) along with profile descriptions and images
(profile and cover photos) of every gang and non-gang member profile.
The resulting
dataset consists of
400 gang member Twitter profiles and 2,865 non-gang member
Twitter profiles.
The dataset has a total of 821,412 tweets from gang member profiles
and 7,238,758 tweets from non-gang member profiles.
Prior to analyzing any text
content, we removed all of the seed words used to find gang member profiles, all stop
words, and performed stemming across all tweets and profile descriptions.

Data Analysis For Feature Extraction
Feature
engineering
is
an
important
part
of
any
study
that
uses
supervised-machine learning.
Specifically, studies have shown that carefully identified
features can improve the performance of Twitter-based supervised learning tasks [39,
40].
Thus,
we next explore the differences between gang and non-gang members’
Twitter usage patterns to find promising features for classifying their Twitter profiles.
Based on previous studies and our observations during the manual verification of gang
member profiles,
we explored 5 different feature types that are listed below to see
whether they can be used to discriminate gang member profiles in Twitter.
They are:
1.
Tweet Text – This includes the textual content present in a tweet.
We extract
unigrams from the tweet text and treat each unigram as a feature.
2.
Twitter
Profile
Description – This
includes
user-provided description of
a
Twitter profile.
We extract unigrams from the text appear in the Twitter profile
description and treat each unigram as a feature.
3.
Music Interests – We process each YouTube video shared along with tweets and
extract unigram features from the video title, description and comments posted
on the YouTube video.
4.
Emoji – We extract emoji from tweet text and treat each emoji as a feature.
5.
Profile Image – We extract image tags using a third-party service for each profile
and cover image posted on Twitter and treat the image tags as features.
24
This chapter provides a detail
analysis of
each of
the above feature types and
how well
each of
them contributed to the task of
identifying Twitter gang member
profiles.
4.1
Tweet text
Tweet text is commonly used to extract features in many Twitter-based studies
that analyze the content posted on Twitter [39].
Common features extracted from
Tweet text include n-grams,
which are the contiguous sequences of
n words that
appear
in a tweet
text
fragment,
and Part-of-Speech (PoS)
tags,
which are the
categories of words that exhibit similar properties or functions based on how words are
used in the language.
In our experiment, we use unigrams extracted from tweet text
as features.
We avoid using PoS tags as features in our experiments as we noticed that
gang members’ tweets contain words that are not available in lexicons that were used
to train state-of-the-art Twitter PoS taggers (also known as out-of-vocabulary words
or OOV), leading PoS taggers to output PoS tag patterns that are not meaningful.
Figure 4.1 summarizes the words seen most often in the gang and non-gang
members’
tweets as word clouds.
They show a clear difference in language.
For
example, we note that gang members more frequently use curse words in comparison
to ordinary users.
Although cursing is frequent in tweets, they represent just 1.15% of
all words used [41].
In contrast, we found 5.72% of all words posted by gang member
accounts to be classified as curse words,
which is nearly five times more than the
average curse word usage on Twitter.
The word clouds also reflect the fact that gang
members often talk about drugs and money with terms such as smoke, high, hit, and
money, while ordinary users hardly speak about finances and drugs.
We also noticed
that gang members talk about material things with terms such as got, money, make,
real,
need whereas ordinary users tend to vocalize their feelings with terms such as
25
new, like, love, know, want, look, make, us.
These differences make it clear that the
individual
words used by gang and non-gang members will
be relevant features for
gang profile classification.
(a) Gang members.
(b) Non-gang members.
Figure 4.1:
Comparison of words used in tweets.
4.2
Twitter Profile Description
On Twitter,
a user can give a self-description as a part of the user’s profile.
A
comparison of the top 10 words in gang members’
and non-gang members’
Twitter
profile descriptions is shown in Figure 4.2.
The first 10 words are the most frequently
used words in non-gang members’
profiles and the latter 10 words are the most
frequently used words in gang members’ profiles.
Word comparison shows that gang
members prefer to use curse words (nigga, fuck, shit) in their profile descriptions while
non-gang members use words related to their feelings or interests (love,
life,
live,
music, book).
The terms rip and free which appear in approximately 12% of all gang
member Twitter profiles, suggest that gang members use their profile descriptions as
a space to grieve for their fallen or incarcerated gang members.
The term gang in
26
Figure 4.2:
Word usage in profile descriptions:
gang vs non-gang.
gang members’
profile descriptions suggest that gang members like to self-identify
themselves on Twitter.
Such lexical
features may therefore be of
great importance
for automatically identifying gang member profiles.
We take counts of unigrams from
gang and non-gang members’ Twitter profile descriptions as classification features.
4.3
Music interests
It has been recognized that music is a key cultural component in an urban lifestyle
and that gang members often want to emulate the scenarios and activities the music
conveys [9].
Our analysis confirms that the influence of gangster rap is expressed in
gang members’ Twitter posts.
We found that 51.25% of the gang members collected
27
have a tweet that links to a YouTube video.
Following these links, a simple keyword
search for the terms gangsta and hip-hop in the YouTube video description found
that 76.58% of the shared links are related to hip-hop music,
gangster rap,
and the
culture that surrounds this music genre.
Moreover, this high proportion is not driven
by a small
number of
profiles that prolifically share YouTube links;
eight YouTube
links are shared on average by a gang member in our dataset.
Recognizing the frequency with which gang members post YouTube links on
gangster rap and hip-hop, we consider the YouTube videos posted in a user’s tweets as
features for the classifier.
In particular, for each YouTube video tweeted, we used the
YouTube API
16
to retrieve the video’s description and its comments.
Further analysis
of YouTube data showed a difference between terms in gang members’ YouTube data
and non-gang members’ YouTube data.
For example, the top 5 terms (after stemming

Emoji
Emoji has become a widely used language construct to express emotion in social
media.
Studies have shown that people associate different meanings to emoji
when
they use the same emoji
in different message contexts [42,
43].
Due to the recent
work by Patton et al.
that discusses the use of emoji by gang members [19], we were
motivated to study if
and how gang and non-gang members use emoji
symbols in
their tweets.
Our analysis found that gang members have a penchant for using just a
small set of emoji symbols that convey their anger and violent behavior through their

tweets.
We also noticed that gang members use emoji in non-traditional ways when
discussing drug-related incidents in their tweets.
This aligns with the context-based
emoji meanings reported in the emoji-related literature [42, 43].
Figure 4.3 illustrates the emoji distribution for the top 20 most frequent emojis
used in gang member profiles in our dataset.
The fuel pump emoji
was the most
frequently used emoji
by the gang members,
which is often used in the context of
selling or consuming marijuana.
The pistol
emoji
is the second most frequent
in our dataset,
which is often used with the guardsman emoji
or the police cop
emoji
in an ‘emoji
chain’.
Figure 4.4 presents some prototypical
‘chaining’
of
emojis used by gang members.
The chains may reflect their anger at law enforcement
officers, as a cop emoji
is often followed by the emoji of a gun
, bomb
, or

.
We found that 32.25% of gang members in our dataset have chained
together the police and the pistol emoji
, compared to just 1.14% of non-gang
members.
Moreover, only 1.71% of non-gang members have used the hundred points
emoji
and pistol
emoji
together in tweets while 53% of gang members have
used them.
A variety of the angry face emoji
such as devil
face emoji
and imp
emoji
were also common in gang member tweets.
The frequency of each emoji
symbol
used across the set of
user’s tweets are thus considered as features for our
classifier.
4.5
Profile image
In our profile verification process,
we observed that most gang member profiles
portray a context representative of
gang culture.
Some examples of
these profile
pictures are shown in Figure 4.6, where the user holds or points weapons, is seen in a
group fashion which displays a gangster culture, or is showing off graffiti, hand signs,
tattoos and bulk cash.
Descriptions of these images may thus empower our classifier.
Thus, we translated profile images into features using Clarifai web service
17
.
Clarifai
offers a free API to query a deep learning system that tags images with a set of scored
keywords that reflect what is seen in the image.
We tagged the profile image and cover
image for each profile using 20 tags identified by Clarifai.
Figure 4.5 offers the 20

most often used tags applied to gang and non-gang member profiles.
Since we take all
the tags returned for an image, we see common words such as people and adult coming
up in the top 20 tag set.
However, gang member profile images were assigned unique
tags such as trigger, bullet, worship while non-gang images were uniquely tagged with
beach, seashore, dawn, wildlife, sand, pet.
The set of tags returned by Clarifai
were
thus considered as features for the classifier.

Approach
This chapter discusses the approach we used to classify gang member profiles on
Twitter using a heterogeneous set of features discussed earlier.
It also discusses the
word embeddings-based methods used to represent the features.
5.1
Using Heterogeneous Features
The unigrams of tweets, profile text, and linked YouTube video descriptions and
comments,
along with the distribution of emoji
symbols and the profile image tags
were used to train four different classification algorithms.
They are:
1.
Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) – This is a conditional probabilistic learning-based
classifier
which is
based on the assumption that
the value of
a feature is
independent of the value of any other feature for a given the class variable.
2.
Logistic Regression Classifier (LR) – This is a classification algorithm which
takes
a categorical
dependent
variable
and requires
the
outcome
to take
membership in one of a limited number of categories.
3.
Random Forest Classifier (RF) – This is an ensemble of decision trees which is
based on the intuition that a large set of weak learners (decision trees in random
forest) can be used together to create a strong learner (random forest).
Random
forest creates a set of decision trees where each decision tree is created from a
random sample with replacement of the training set and a random subset of the
features.
33
4.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) – This is a popular supervised machine learning
algorithm that tries to find the best hyperplane which can separate the classes
in the training data.
The hyperplane that represents the largest separation, or
margin, between the two classes (maximum-margin hyperplane) can be selected
as the best hyperplane.
To perform non-linear classification SVM is using a
technique known as ’kernel’ to map inputs into a high-dimensional feature space.
These four algorithms were chosen because they are known to perform well over
text features,
which is the dominant type of
feature considered.
The performance
of the models are empirically compared to determine the most suitable classification
technique for this problem.
Data for the models are represented as a vector of term
frequencies where the terms were collected from one or more feature sets described
above.
5.2
Representing Text Using Word Embeddings
We also explored using word embeddings
to represent
our
features.
Word
embedding models are neural language models that tries to learn rich representations
for words in a text corpus in a way that the representations it learn better capture
the syntactic and semantic similarities of the words in the corpus.
They try to learn
embeddings in high dimensional spaces (words mapped in to vectors) thus capturing
semantic similarities among words which were not possible to capture using other well
performing models such as bag-of-words or n-gram models.
Recent studies have shown
that word embeddings learned with skip-gram based models using negative sampling
better capture the context of a word, thus learning to rich word embeddings [32].
Due
to their recent success in variety of text processing tasks along with the introduction
of easy to use off the shelf tools like Word2Vec to learn word embeddings, they have
become very popular and continue to improve the state-of-the-art in text classification

tasks [44].
Previous research have shown that word embeddings work best when it
is given with large amounts of training data [45].
Therefore we choose to use word
embeddings to improve our classifiers using the 3,265 gang and non-gang member
profile dataset we collected as training data to learn word embeddings.
Figure 5.1 shows the steps involved in learning the word embeddings and using
them to build classifiers.
First we converted non textual
features such as emojis,
profile and cover images into textual
features.
Then the seed words used for data
collection were removed.
We further pre-processed the dataset by removing stop
words and stemming all profile descriptions and tweet text.
We used the Word2Vec
tool
along with our pre-processed dataset to train a skip-gram model
with negative
sampling.
Skip-gram model
tries to predict a target word given it’s context words,
which are typically the words surrounded by the target word.
It is formally defined
in [32].
When training the skip-gram model, we set the negative sampling to 10 sample
words,
which seems to work well
with medium size datasets.
We set the context
word window to be 5,
so that it will consider 5 words to left and right of the target

This setting is suitable for sentences where average sentence length is less than
11 words,
which is the case in tweets.
We ignore the words that occur less than 5
times in our training corpus.
Table 5.1 provides statistics on the number of
words
found in each type of feature used to train the word embedding model.
We obtain
word vectors of size 300 using Word2Vec tool.

word vectors are denoted by n and ith word vector is denoted by w

Once the
word vectors are trained, they are used to represent features which is then fed to the

To represent a Twitter profile,
we retrieve word vectors for all
the words that
appear in a particular profile including the words appear in tweets, profile description,
words extracted from emoji,
cover and profile images converted to textual
formats,
and words extracted from YouTube video comments and descriptions for all YouTube
videos shared in to the user’s timeline.
Those word vectors are combined to compute
the final
feature vector for the Twitter profile.
To combine the word vectors,
we
consider five different methods.

Evaluation
This chapter presents the evaluation of our approach to automatically find gang
member profiles on Twitter.
We first discuss the experimental
setup used and then
we report the evaluation results for our approach using heterogeneous content types.
Finally,
we present the results for using word embedding along with heterogeneous
content types.
6.1
Evaluation - Using Heterogeneous Features
We
first
evaluate
the
performance
of
classifiers
that
use
the
heterogeneous
features to discover gang member profiles on Twitter.
For this purpose,
we use the
training set discussed in Section 3 with 400 gang member profiles (the ‘positive’/‘gang’
class) and 2,865 non-gang member profiles (the ‘negative’/‘non-gang’
class).
We
trained and evaluated the performance of
the classifiers mentioned in Section 5.1
under a 10-fold cross validation scheme.
For each 10-fold cross validation experiment,
we report three evaluation metrics for the ‘gang’ and ‘non-gang’ classes, namely, the
P recision = tp/(tp + f p),
Recall
= tp/(tp + f n),
and F 1-score = 2 ∗ (P recision ∗
Recall)/(P recision + Recall) where tp is the number of
true positives,
f p is the
number of false positives, tn is the number of true negatives, and f n is the number of
false negatives.
We report these metrics for the positive ‘gang’ and negative ‘non-gang’
classes separately because of class imbalance in our dataset.
For each of the four learning algorithms (i.e., NB, LR, RF, and SVM), we consider
variations involving only tweet text, emoji, profile, image, or music interest (YouTube

comments and video description) features, and a final variant that considers all types
of features together.
The classifiers that use a single feature type were intended to
help us study the quality of
their predictive power by itself.
When building these
single-feature classifiers,
we filtered the training dataset based on the availability of
the single feature type in the training data.
For example, we only used Twitter profiles
that had at least one emoji in their tweets to train classifiers which are entirely based
on emoji features.
We found 3,085 such profiles out of the 3,265 profiles in the training
set.
Table 6.1 reports,
in braces (‘{ }’),
the number of
gang and non-gang profiles
that contain a particular feature type, and hence the number of profiles used for the
10-fold cross validation.
When all
feature types were considered,
we developed two
different models:
1.
Model(1):
This model is trained with all profiles in the training set.
2.
Model(2):
This model is trained with profiles that contain every feature type.
Because a Twitter profile may not have every feature type, Model(1) represents
a practical
scenario where not every Twitter profile contains every type of
feature.
In this model,
the non-occurrence of
a feature is represented by ‘zeroing out’
the
39
feature value during model training.
Model(2) represents the ideal scenario where all
profiles contain every feature type.
For this model, we used 1,358 training instances
(42% of
all
training instances),
out of
which 172 were gang members (43% of
all
gang members) and 1,186 were non-gang members (41% of all
non-gang members).
We used version 0.17.1 of
scikit-learn
18
machine learning library to implement the
classifiers.
6.1.1
Experimental results
Table 6.2 presents the average precision,
recall,
and F 1-score over the 10 folds
for the single-feature and combined feature classifiers.
It is reasonable to expect that
any Twitter profile is not that of
a gang member,
predicting a Twitter user as a
non-gang member is much easier than predicting a Twitter user as a gang member.
Moreover false positive classifications of the ‘gang’
class may be detrimental
to law
enforcement investigations,
which may go awry as they surveil
an innocent person
based on the classifier’s suggestion.
We thus believe that a small
false positive rate
of
the ‘gang’
class to be an especially important evaluation metric.
We say that a
classifier is ‘ideal’ if it demonstrates high precision, recall, and F 1-score for the ‘gang’
class while performing well on the ‘non-gang’ class as well.
The best performing classifier that considers single features is a Random Forest
model
over tweet features (T),
with a reasonable F 1-score of
0.7229 for the ‘gang’
class.
It also features the highest F 1-score for the ‘non-gang’
class (0.9671).
Its
strong performance is intuitive given the striking differences in language as shown in
Figure 4.1 and discussed in Section 4.1 of Chapter 4.
We also noted that music features
offer promising results, with an F 1-score of 0.6505 with a Naive Bayes classifier, as well
as emoji features with an F 1-score of 0.6067 also achieved by a Naive Bayes classifier.
However,
the use of profile data and image tags by themselves yield relatively poor

F 1-scores no matter which classifier considered.
There may be two reasons for this
despite the differences we observed in Chapter 4.
First,
these two feature types did
not generate a large number of specific features for learning.
For example, descriptions
are limited to just 160 characters per profile, leading to a limited number of unigrams
(in our dataset,
10 on average) that can be used to train the classifiers.
Second,
the profile images were tagged by a third party Web service which is not specifically
designed to identify gang hand signs,
drugs and guns,
which are often shared by
gang members.
This led to a small set of image tags in their profiles that were fairly
generic, i.e., the image tags in Figure 4.5 such as ‘people’, ‘man’, and ‘adult’.
Combining these diverse sets of features into a single classifier yields even better
results.
Our results for Model(1) show that the Random Forest achieves the highest
F 1-scores for both ‘gang’ (0.7364) and ‘non-gang’ (0.9690) classes and yields the best
precision of
0.8792,
which corresponds to a low false positive rate when labeling a
profile as a gang member.
Despite the fact that it has lower positive recall compared
to the second best performing classifier (a Random Forest trained over only tweet
text features (T)),
for this problem setting,
we should be willing to increase the
chance that
a gang member
will
go unclassified if
it
means reducing the chance
of
applying a ‘gang’
label
to a non-gang member.
When we tested Model(2),
a
Random Forrest classifier achieved an F 1-score of
0.7755 (improvement of
7.28%
with respect to the best performing single feature type classifier (T)) for ‘gang’ class
with a precision of 0.8961 (improvement of 6.26% with respect to (T)) and a recall
of
0.6994 (improvement of
9.26% with respect to (T)).
Model(2) thus outperforms
Model(1),
and we expect its performance to improve with the availability of
more
training data with all feature types.
42
6.1.2
Evaluation Over Unseen Profiles
To evaluate our classifiers on completely unseen Twitter profiles, we first created
a Twitter dataset of random Twitter profiles collected from two U.S.
cities that are
known for gang-related activities.
We captured real-time tweets from Los Angeles,
CA
19
and from ten South Side,
Chicago neighborhoods
[15]
using the
Twitter
streaming API.
We consider these areas with known gang presence on social
media
to ensure that some positive profiles would appear in our test set.
We ultimately
collected 24,162 Twitter profiles:
15,662 from Los Angeles, and 8,500 from Chicago.
We populated data for
each profile by using the 3,200 most
recent
tweets
(the
maximum that can be collected from Twitter’s API) for each profile.
Since the 24,162
profiles are far too many to label manually, we qualitatively study those profiles the
classifier placed into the ‘gang’ class.
We then tested the trained classifiers using the above unseen dataset.
First,
we used our best performing random forest classifier (which use all
feature types)
and tested it on the unseen dataset.
We then analyzed the Twitter profiles that our
classifier labeled as belonging to the ‘gang’
class.
Each of those profiles had several
features which overlap with gang members such as displaying hand signs and weapons
in their profile images or in videos posted by them,
gang names or gang-related
hashtags in their profile descriptions,
frequent use of
curse words,
and the use of
terms such as “my homie" to refer to self-identified gang members.
Representative
tweets extracted from those profiles are depicted in Figure 6.1.
The most frequent
words found in tweets from those profiles were shit,
nigga,
got,
bitch,
go,
fuck etc.
and their user profiles had terms such as free,
artist,
shit,
fuck,
freedagang,
and
ripthefallen.
They had frequently used emojis such as face with tears of joy, hundred
points symbol, fire, skull, money bag, and pistol.
For some profiles, it was less obvious

Figure 6.1:
Sample tweets from identified gang members.
that the classifier correctly identified a gang member.
Such profiles used the same
emojis and curse words commonly found in gang members profiles,
but their profile
picture and tweet content was not indicative of a gang affiliation.
In conclusion, we find that in a real-time-like setting, the classifier to be able to
extract profiles with features that strongly suggest gang affiliation.
Of course, these
profiles demand further investigation and extensive evidence from other sources in
order to draw a concrete conclusion,
especially in the context of a law enforcement
investigation.
We refrain from reporting any profile names or specific details about
the profiles labeled as a ‘gang’ member to comply with the applicable IRB governing
this human subject research.

Evaluation - Representing Text Using Word Embeddings
We built classifiers using three different learning algorithms,
namely Logistic
Regression (LR),
Random Forest (RF),
and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
We
used version 0.17.1 of scikit-learn
20
machine learning library for Python to implement
the classifiers.
An open source Python library,
Gensim [46]
was used to generate
the word embeddings.
We compare our results with the two best performing models
reported in our previous experiment.

Table 6.3:
Classification results based on 10-fold cross validation.
Table 6.3 presents 10-fold cross validation experiment results for baseline models
(first and second rows) and our word embeddings-based models (from third row to
seventh row).
As mentioned earlier both baseline models use a random forest classifier
trained on term frequencies of unigram features extracted from all feature types, and
the two baseline models only differs on the training data filtering method based on
the availability of features in the training dataset as described in [47].
The baseline
Model(1) uses all profiles in the dataset and has a F 1-score of 0.7364 for ‘gang’ class
and 0.9690 for ‘non-gang’ class.
The baseline Model(2) which only uses profiles that
contain each and every feature type has a F 1-score of
0.7755 for ‘gang’
class and
F 1-score of 0.9720 for ‘non-gang’ class.
Vector
sum (V
p
sum
)
is
one of
the basic operations
we can perform on word
embedding vectors.
The random forest classifier performs the best among vector
sum-based classifiers
where
logistic
regression and SVM classifiers
also perform
45
comparatively well.
Using vector mean (V
p
avg
) improves all
classifier results and
SVM classifier trained on mean of word embeddings achieves very close results to the
baseline Model(2).
Multiplying vector sum with corresponding word counts for each
word in word embeddings (V
p
sum(count)
) degrades the classifier accuracy for correctly
identifying the positive class.
When we multiply words by their corresponding tf -idf
values before taking the vector sum, we again observe an increase in classifier accuracy
(V
p
sum(tf−idf)
).
But we achieve the best performance by averaging the vector sum
weighted by term frequency (V
p
avg(sum(count))
).
Here we multiply the mean of the word
embeddings by count of
each word,
which beats all
other word embeddings-based
models and the two baselines.
In this setting,
logistic regression classifier trained
on word embeddings performs the best with a F 1-score of 0.7835.
This is a 6.39%
improvement in performance when compared to the baseline Model(1) and a 1.03%
improvement in performance when compared to baseline Model(2).
Overall,
out of
the five vector operations that we used to train machine learning classifiers, four gave
us classifier models that beat baseline Model(1).
Two vector based operations gave us
classifier models that either achieved very similar results to baseline Model(2) or beat
it.
This evaluation demonstrates the promise of using pre-trained word embeddings
to boost the accuracy of
supervised learning algorithms for Twitter gang member
profile classification.

Conclusion and Future Work
This
thesis
presented an approach to address
the problem of
automatically
identifying gang member profiles on Twitter.
Developing such automated systems
is challenging,
mainly due to difficulties in finding online gang member profiles for
developing training datasets.
We outlined a process to curate one of
the largest
sets of
verifiable gang member Twitter profiles that have ever been studied.
We
proposed an approach that uses features extracted from textual descriptions, emojis,
images and videos shared on Twitter (textual
features extracted from images,
and
videos).
Exploratory analysis of
these types of
features revealed interesting,
and
sometimes striking differences in the ways gang and non-gang members use Twitter.
Classifiers trained over features that highlight these differences, were evaluated under
10-fold cross validation.
Our best classifiers achieved promising F1-score over the
gang profiles.
Model(1) uses all
profiles in the dataset and has a F1-score of 0.7364
and Model(2) which only uses
profiles
that
contain each and every feature type
has a F1-score of
0.7755.
We then explored using word embeddings to represent
features in our classifiers.
Our experiments demonstrated that word embeddings
achieved superior performance a F 1–score of 0.7835.
This is a 6.39% improvement
in performance
when compared to the
Model(1)
and a 1.03% improvement
in
performance when compared to Model(2).
The
work discussed in this
thesis
can be
extended in several
ways.
One
obvious
way to improve
the
classification models
is
to strengthen our
training
dataset
by including more gang member
Twitter
profiles
by searching for
more
47
location-independent keywords.
We believe more labeled data can lead to better
word embedding models
which will
eventually improve the accuracy of
the final
classification models.
Another
way to improve
the
classification models
is
by
introducing custom image tagging models that are specifically designed to identify
commonly seen objects in gang members’ profile images.
The image tagging service
we used was not trained on images specific to gang member tweets such as gang
hand signs
or
pointed guns.
Thus,
we
noticed that
the
image-based features
obtained from the Clarify image tagging service tend to tag images with generic
keywords such as ‘people’
or ‘hands’.
Building our own image classification system
specifically designed to classify images found on gang member profiles could improve
the image-based classification models.
Past research has also shown that carefully
incorporating domain-specific knowledge into machine learning problems can improve
the performance them [48].
Thus, crowd-sourced knowledge-bases such as HipWiki
21
that can be utilized to automatically extract gang names and gang-related slang terms
can be used to further improve word embedding models.
Another way to improve the
classification accuracy is to experiment whether “having a gang name in the profile
description” as a feature can improve our results rather than treating gang names as
unigram features.
