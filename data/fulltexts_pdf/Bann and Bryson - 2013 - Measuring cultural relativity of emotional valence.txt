Abstract
Researchers since at least Darwin have debated whether and to
what extent emotions are universal or culture-dependent. How-
ever, previous studies have primarily focused on facial expres-
sions and on a limited set of emotions.
Given that emotions
have a substantial
impact
on human lives,
evidence for cul-
tural emotional relativity might be derived by applying distri-
butional semantics techniques to a text corpus of self-reported
behaviour. Here, we explore this idea by measuring the valence
and arousal of the twelve most popular emotion keywords ex-
pressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter. We do this in three
geographical regions:
Europe,
Asia and North America.
We
demonstrate that in our sample,
the valence and arousal lev-
els of the same emotion keywords differ significantly with re-
spect
to these geographical
regions — Europeans are,
or at
least present themselves as more positive and aroused,
North
Americans are more negative and Asians appear to be more
positive but less aroused when compared to global valence and
arousal levels of the same emotion keywords.
Our work is the
first in kind to programatically map large text corpora to a di-
mensional model of affect.
Keywords:
Semantic Clustering,
Emotion Analysis; Twitter;
Core Affect Model.
Introduction
The question as to whether the experience and expression
of emotions is universal
or relative to specific cultures has
resulted in a wide variety of studies,
with theories ranging
from the universality hypothesis to culture-specific facial ex-
pressions.
Here we present
evidence that
culture is a nec-
essary framework for researchers studying variation in emo-
tions.
Independent of the question of biological differences
in the experience of emotions, it would be unsurprising if cul-
ture shapes our conscious perception, expression and experi-
ence of emotions, as has been hypothesised for other cogni-
tive phenomena (Hunt & Agnoli, 1991; Fuhrman et al., 2011).
Here, we use Latent Semantic Clustering on an emotional text
corpus mined from Twitter to discern how the primary prop-
erties normally attributed to emotional keywords — valence
and arousal — differ as the keywords are used in the same lan-
guage (English) as exploited across different global regions.
The Conceptualisation of Emotion Qualia
Emotion qualia refers to the raw feel
of an emotion.
The
actual phenomenon of a particular emotion experienced may
differ according to each person’s perception or understand-
ing of that emotion,
with perception being the result of the
individual’s past and hypothesised responses, unique to each
human being.
Barrett (2006) describes the act of conceptual-
ising core affect, or in other words, why people attach emo-
tion labels to the experience of emotion qualia. Since emotion
keywords are constructed from conceptual knowledge about
the world, emotions themselves may be concepts that humans
begin learning in infancy and continuously extend and revise
throughout
life (Lindquist
& Barrett,
2008).
This repeated
experience of labelling a combination of core affect and the
context
in which it
occurs as an emotion provides training
in how to recognise and respond to that
emotion.
In this
sense,
Barrett describes emotions as simulations.
This skill
of conceptualising core affect as an emotion could be a core
aspect
of emotional
intelligence,
in much the same way as
conceptual
thinking is core to cognitive intelligence.
Each
person learns the label in association with their unique experi-
ence, thus each person’s conceptualisation of their emotional
spectrum is unique.
Cultures,
formed of communicating in-
dividuals,
may therefore also be unique if individual
expe-
riences vary somehow systematically.
We base our analysis
on this hypothesis.
The reader should bear in mind that we
are not analysing emotion keywords in particular, rather, we
are analysing emotion conceptualisations,
or what
cultures
understand specific emotion keywords to mean, using Latent
Semantic Clustering to infer these meanings.
Core Affect
Core affect
is
an emerging paradigm in affective neuro-
science,
and postulates a continuous approach to defining
emotions (Posner et
al.,
2005).
Several
core-affect,
or cir-
cumplex models have been proposed (e.g.
Watson & Telle-
gen,
1985; Russell,
1980; Cacioppo & Berntson,
1994),
yet
all have one thing in common:
they represent emotions as a
single point in a continuous space defined by two (or rarely
three) dimensions.
Different
labels have been assigned to
these two dominant dimensions by various theorists, such as
pleasure and engagement, however most commonly, valence
and arousal are chosen.
Thus far, there has been no attempt
to computationally pinpoint emotions or documents within a
core affect model using ‘online’ and ‘big’ data;
to date,
re-
search regarding the core affect
model
has either been the-
oretical (e.g.
Watson & Tellegen,
1985),
or conducted via a
limited survey (e.g. Russell, 1980).
Core affect is one of two main theories regarding the rep-
resentation of emotions,
the other being the Basic Emotion
model,
however,
neither has thus far received unequivocal
support.
Basic emotions could turn out to map to multiple
subtypes of coherent emotion networks,
but this implies we
need to split basic emotion categories into further subtypes to
better reflect these emotion networks (Hamann, 2012; Bann,
arXiv:1304.7507v1 [cs.CL] 28 Apr 2013
2012).
Here we extend this view and suggest that the core
affect model enables us to quantify the properties of the basic
emotions themselves.
Previous Work
There is growing evidence that aspects of a person’s psychol-
ogy can be predicted from their language usage. In the 1990s,
human semantics was shown to be recoverable from linguis-
tic corpra independent of any further grounding (Lowe, 1997;
Bryson,
2008).
Recent
applications to individual
psychol-
ogy include discovering individual
differences in personal-
ity (Pennebaker & King, 1999),
discovering cultural change
in moral
beliefs (Bilovich & Bryson,
2008),
as well
as for
emotion categorization (Fitzpatrick & Logan, 2011).
French
discovered that co-occurrence techniques such as LSA does
not detect personality from short text samples (French & Gill,
2007), but do reveal that texts expressing particular emotions
have a greater semantic similarity to corresponding exemplar
words (Gill et al., 2008).
A recent study by Jack et al. (2012) found significant ev-
idence that facial expressions are indeed culture-dependent;
that is, different cultures represent the same emotions differ-
ently.
However,
whether or not this is because they experi-
ence different emotion qualia is another question.
Using lan-
guage, rather than facial expressions, as an accessor to emo-
tion will
enable a much more detailed and less ambiguous
analysis,
increasing significance by “throwing more data at
the problem” (Recchia & Jones, 2009, p.3).
Currently,
there have been few attempts to analyse cul-
tural differences using language semantics.
Language plays
a key role in how emotions are conceptualised (and thus per-
ceived); Lindquist states “language can be no more removed
from emotion,
than flour can be removed from an already
baked cake” (Lindquist, 2009, p.1). Recently, Bann & Bryson
(2012) demonstrated how conceptualisations of emotions can
be inferred by performing Latent Semantic Analysis on a cor-
pus of self-reported emotional tweets.
Their DELSAR algo-
rithm analysed 21,000 tweets each labelled with an emotion,
and clustered each document in the corpus to its most similar
corresponding emotion label using Latent Semantic Cluster-
ing.
Here we use the same algorithm as the basis for our
analysis.
Corpus
Typing emotion keywords into the Internet
is increasingly
becoming a significant
technique for individual
expression.
There now exists a rich available source of information about
emotions on the Internet, because so many people spend time
expressing how they feel in blogs, forums, social networking
websites and the like.
We use data from the microblogging
website Twitter to perform large-scale analysis of the lan-
guage used in thousands of expressions of emotions within
tweets.
Acquiring a significantly larger corpus than Bann
& Bryson (2012),
we use the Gardenhose level of Twitter’s
streaming API
1
to create a corpus of 5,625,844 tweets
2
col-
lected between 19th October 2012 and 18th January 2013.
Each emotion keyword (see selection criteria below) is given
a five-minute streaming window in turn for the duration of the
period,
ensuring an even temporal distribution of Tweets is
collected. Table 1 describes our corpus, split by ‘cultural’ re-
gion. We use the tweet’s timezone as an indication of the cor-
responding user’s geographical location; seeing as it is very
unlikely that a Twitter user would select a timezone other than
that which they reside in, it is somewhat safe to assume that
this reflects the cultural origin of each user.

Bangkok,
Hong Kong,
Tokyo;
the Eu-
rope region consists of the timezones London,

can (NA) region consists of the timezones Eastern Time (US
& Canada),
Central
Time (US & Canada),
Mountain Time
(US & Canada), Pacific Time (US & Canada).
Selection of emotions.
As opposed to strictly using the ba-
sic emotions as identified by Bann & Bryson (2012), we use
the most popular emotions that are used on Twitter,
that is,
those emotions that
have the highest
stream rate.
Twelve
emotions were selected that had a high rate and that equally
divided into positive/negative and engaged/disengaged theo-
retical categories (see Table 2).
Subcorpus creation. Each subcorpus is created using a limit
of 1000 documents per emotion for all subcorpora to ensure
consistency within our results; we chose 1000 as it is the low-
est value in Table 1. To mitigate micro-temporal effects, if the
number of documents for a particular emotion is significantly
greater than 1000, we use a modulus function to extract 1000

documents equally spaced across the subcorpus — for exam-
ple, if a particular emotion in a particular subcorpus has 6000
documents, we take one document every six documents.
We
also create six control subcorpora so to compare our region-
specific results with a baseline.
We use the same modulus
function to extract 1000 equally spaced tweets,
but without
any timezone clause, selecting six random starting points.
Proposed Method
We use DELSAR (Bann & Bryson, 2012, see Algorithm 1) to
generate the clustering matrix for each subcorpus — the three
regions Asia, Europe and NA, and six random controls.
Algorithm 1
DELSAR
Require:
Corpus C and Keyword Set K, where each docu-
ment in C is mapped to one emotion keyword, emotion, in
K (through corpus generation)

For each subcorpus, DELSAR uses LSA (Landauer & Du-
mais, 1997) to create a document-document matrix of cosine
similarities (Similarity Matrix),
in which similar documents
are closer to one (i.e.
the cosine of the angle between their
vectors). It creates a clustering matrix that represents the cor-
pus as an emotion-emotion matrix, describing how each emo-
tion is similar to each other emotion.
All analysis was performed on a 64-bit Intel Core i5 CPU
2x2.67GHz with 4GB RAM using the
GENSIM
framework
for Python (
ˇ
Reh
˚
u
ˇ
rek & Sojka,
2010) to create LSA spaces.
For all tasks, we use a dimension of 36 and use Log-Entropy
normalisation as our Association Function, found to generate
optimal
results (Nakov et
al.,
2001) and recommended for
LSA (Landauer & Dumais, 1997).
Valence and Arousal
Here we take valance to mean the theoretical positive or neg-
ative attribution of an emotion keyword, and similarly arousal
to mean the implied level of engagement.
We should use the
keywords theoretical
valence and theoretical
arousal
as we
are measuring emotion keywords relative to their generally
accepted categorisation, although there does seem to be con-
sistency in these categorisations between theorists.
Table 2
shows the theoretical definitions of our keywords,
accumu-
lated using several
circumplex models of affect
(Watson &
Tellegen, 1985; Russell, 1980; Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994).

We calculate the valence and arousal levels of each emo-
tion for each subcorpus as follows.
First,
we run DELSAR
on the subcorpus to generate clustering vectors for each emo-
tion.
Each emotion’s valence is then calculated as the num-
ber of positive elements within its vector,
as defined in Ta-
ble 2,
divided by the total
number of documents across all
elements (which will always be 1000), or in other words, the
percentage of positive elements within its vector.
Similarly,
each emotion’s arousal is calculated as the percentage of en-
gaged elements within its vector, again as defined in Table 2.
We then normalise each valence and arousal
value by tak-
ing away the average valence and arousal value, respectively,
for all subcorpora analysed — Asia, Europe and NA regions
and the six control subcorpora.
This ensures relativity of the
resulting circumplex model between these analysed groups;
these groups can now be compared to one another to estab-
lish similarities and differences between them.
Results
Figure 1 shows a plot of our circumplex of selected subcor-
pora. We can see that some emotions are more tightly packed
than others,
and interestingly,
that low-valence-high-arousal
and high-valence-low-arousal emotions are much more uni-
versally similar when compared to the other two quadrants
of the circumplex.
In order to visualise each separate region
more clearly we illustrate the aggregate theoretical positivity
and engagement for each subcorpus, shown in Figure 2. This
clearly illustrates that our three regions do indeed have dif-
ferent conceptualisations of the same emotion keyword;
we
see that the region Europe is a much more positive and en-
gaged culture; in other words, Europeans find the same emo-
tion keywords to be more positive and engaging when com-
pared to other cultures and indeed our control samples. Also,
we discover that Asians find the same emotion keywords to
be somewhat more positive, and North Americans somewhat
more negative, with negligible arousal differences.
In order to analyse how tightly packed our emotion clus-
Figure 1: Circumplex of three regions and six controls.
ters are in Figure 1, we conducted K-Means cluster analysis
to determine the centroids for each emotion,
calculating the
distances of each emotion to its centroid.
We plot our cen-
troids, shown in Figure 3, resulting in a circumplex that could
be thought of as a universal emotion circumplex, illustrating
what people think emotions to be, relative to each other emo-
tion. We can see that the emotions scared, depressed and sad
have a very similar valence, yet varying arousal levels; so too
do the emotions sleepy and sad.
We can also see, albeit less
definitively,
that the emotions stressed and surprised have a
similar arousal level, but opposite valence; so too do the emo-
tions sad and sleepy.
In order to identify which emotions have the most and least
similar conceptualisations across cultures,
we calculate the
distance of each emotion to its respective centroid for each
region, and calculate the sum of these distances for each emo-
tion across all subcorpora, shown in Table 3. We discover that
the emotions sad and stressed have the most similar concep-
tualisations across all cultures; in other words, people under-
stand these two emotions to mean the same thing independent
of culture. Similarly, we find that the emotions surprised and
depressed have the most
widely varying conceptualisations
across cultures;
in other words,
different cultures have very
different valence and arousal attributions towards these two
emotions.
Note that we do not include the emotion ashamed
in the top two due to a strange anomaly in control group 6
which skews an otherwise relatively tight cluster.
Discussion
We would expect
that
the control
groups would be tightly
clustered around the centre of the circumplex in Figure 2,
and for the most part,
they are.
The exceptions are control
groups one and four, possibly due to the fact the the corpus is
skewed in favour of tweets originating from NA (see Table 1);

each subcorpus.

this is somewhat verified by their closeness to the NA sub-
corpus.
Other than these anomalous subcorpora, the circum-
plex does illustrate how different cultures significantly con-
ceptualise emotions differently,
in keywords of valence and
arousal. Interestingly, there are certain emotions in certain re-
gions that stick out of our analysis.
One example is the emo-
tion depression;
Asians find this emotion much more nega-
tive than all other cultures and control groups.
This could be
due to cultural differences such as coping strategies (Aldwin
& Greenberger, 1987).
Another example concerns the emo-
tions happy and calm; Europeans and Asians find these emo-
tions much more positive than North Americans and all con-
trol groups.
Another suggests that Asians find interest a very
positive and aroused emotion, compared to North Americans
who conceptualise the same emotions, relatively, as negative
and disengaged.
Limitations
We document several limitations of our approach. Firstly, our
database may still contain duplicate tweets, as some users du-
plicate tweets by appending,
for example,
a number at
the
end,
making them unique from one another.
Second,
our

modulus function does not take an even sample for our con-
trol
groups at
the country level,
so they may be skewed in
favour of countries with a higher frequency of documents
within the database (our corpus on the whole is in fact skewed
in favour of NA). Thirdly,
we assume that the emotion key-
words we have selected are in fact emotion qualia as opposed
to adjectives.
Fourth, our corpus is essentially a snapshot in
time and may reflect, for example, the political or economic
climate at the time, or skew due to global events such as the
US election.
Finally, our corpus consists entirely of English
tweets, which skews our results in favour of Western cultures;
our Asia, and to some extent, Europe subcorpora may not be
entirely representative of their respective cultures as we disre-
gard all native languages other than English.
In addition, the
subpopulations of those regions who choose to use Twitter,
and do so in English, may be a biased sample.
Conclusions
Emotions are being increasingly expressed online, and being
able to understand these emotions is rapidly becoming a
concern of AI and Cognitive Science.
By mapping culture-
specific emotion circumplexes,
we hope to be better able to
understand culture-specific perceptions or
even experience
of emotions.
From the work presented here we can conclude
the following:
Emotional semantics depends on culture.
The same emo-
tion keyword in one culture may describe different valence
and arousal properties in another. This seems to be more true
of some keywords than others,
and could be critical where,
for example, a significantly differing conceptualisation of the
emotion depression would require a different understanding
and response.
Emotions vary by geographic region.
Europeans are more
likely to express positiveness and engagement.
Asians are
also more positive than North Americans,
both relative to
each other
and to the control
subcorpora.
Note that
this
may reflect
cultural
differences in the public expression of
emotion rather than its actual
qualia — our method cannot
disambiguate these.
Some emotions do seem to be conceptualised universally.
The emotion keywords
sad and stressed have the same
conceptualisation across
cultures,
whereas
cultures
have
the most
disagreement
regarding the conceptualisation of
surprised.
We
hope
that
our
research paves
the
way for
a
better
understanding of
how language can be used to identify
specific properties of emotions, and we encourage the reader
to verify our results by downloading our code and corpus at
