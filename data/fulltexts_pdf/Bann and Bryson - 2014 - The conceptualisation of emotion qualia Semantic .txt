A plethora of words are used to describe the spectrum of human emotions, but
how many distinct emotions exist,
and how do they interact? Over the past
few decades,
several
theories of
emotion have been proposed,
each founded
upon a set of
basic emotions,
and each supported by an extensive variety of
research including studies in facial expression, ethology, neurology and physi-
ology.
Here we propose a theory that people transmit their understanding of
emotions through the language they use that surrounds mentioned emotion
keywords. Using a labelled corpus of over 21,000 tweets, six of the basic emo-
tion sets proposed in existing literature were analysed using Latent Semantic
Clustering (LSC) to propose the distinctiveness of the semantic meaning at-
tached to the emotional label. We hypothesise that the more distinct language
is used to express a certain emotion,
then the more distinct the perception
(including proprioception) of that emotion is, and thus more basic. This allows
us to select the dimensions best representing the entire spectrum of emotion.
We find that Ekman’s set,
arguably the most frequently used for classifying
emotions, is the most semantically distinct. Next, taking all analysed (that is,
previously proposed) emotion terms into account,
we determine the optimal
semantically irreducible basic emotion set using an iterative LSC algorithm.
Our newly-derived set (Accepting, Ashamed, Contempt, Interested, Joy-
ful, Pleased, Sleepy, Stressed) generates a 6.1% increase in distinctiveness
over Ekman’s set (Angry, Disgusted, Joyful, Sad, Scared).

Introduction
There are a great variety of
words that describe the spectrum of
human
emotion. Many theories posit the existence of a set of ‘basic emotions’ that
are hardwired into our brain as individual neurological circuits,
1–5
and that
all other emotions are derived from these ‘biological primitives’ as either a
combination or specific valence of these neural circuits.
6
Recently, however,
the notion that emotion is a conceptualised act has been proposed,
7
and
experimental results have been shown to support this hypothesis.
8
Emotion
in this sense can be regarded in the same way as colour, insofar we categorise
and communicate discrete colours within the confines of
language,
even
though colour itself is in fact a spectrum of visible light.
The primary objective of this research is to evaluate existing basic emo-
tion sets to discern which contain the most number of emotions expressed
in the most distinct language, testing the hypothesis that the more distinct
an emotion is (that is, unlike any other emotion), the more distinct the lan-
guage is used to express the experience of that emotion.
Semantics refers
to the meaning of
an expression;
in particular,
we consider co-occurring
words to measure similarities of
meaning.
We attempt to show such se-
mantic changes in emotion language from a corpus of explicitly expressed
emotions extracted from the micro-blogging website Twitter, and evaluate
six basic emotion sets on a scale of semantic distinctiveness, based on the
hypothesis that the more distinct the language used to express a certain
emotion, then conceptually (i.e. what we understand that emotion keyword
to mean),
the more psychologically irreducible that emotion is.
The less
semantically accurate a set of emotions is, the more similar these emotions
are to each other, or in other words, if similar words are used when express-
ing two different emotions, then these emotions are, in theory, conceptually,
and thus psychologically, similar. The secondary objective of this research
is to identify a set of basic emotions by identifying the most semantically
distinct emotion keywords relative to the underlying semantic features of
each expression within the corpus.
2.
The Psychology of Emotion
Emotion is that which leads the subject’s condition to become so trans-
formed that one’s judgement is affected,
9
triggered by a subconscious ap-
praisal
process regarding an issue of
personal
value.
10
It is characterised
by behavioral,
expressive,
cognitive,
and physiological
changes
11
and can
be started and executed unconsciously.
12
The desire to experience or not

Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012

experience an emotion largely determines the contents and focus of
con-
sciousness throughout the life span.
13
The above definition of emotion is not a conclusive definition of emo-
tion,
but amalgamates many of
the important aspects from notable the-
orists’
definitions.
Attention is drawn to Aristotle’s wording,
stating that
emotion “is that which...”, implying that emotion is in fact a type of quale,
that is,
a subjective conscious experience that cannot be communicated,
or apprehended by any other means other than direct experience.
14
Qualia
refers to subjective ‘raw’ feelings, for example, the taste of red wine, or the
experience of seeing the colour red. Emotion qualia thus refers to the raw
feel
of
an emotion;
the actual
phenomenon of
a particular emotion expe-
rienced may actually differ according to each person’s perception of
that
emotion.
The dominant theory of emotion postulates the existence of a small set
of hardwired, or ‘basic’, emotions, and consequently the majority of textual
emotion recognition research has been based on such.
anger disgust fear joy sadness surprise
Ekman’s basic emotion set
15
(shown above) is arguably the most fre-
quently used within the field of computer science for emotion mining and
classification.
However,
not only do the emotions comprising each basic
emotion set vary amongst theorists,
they do not always agree the defini-
tions of emotion, thus adding to the confusion in delineating the set of basic
emotions,
or whether they exist at all.
This can be viewed as a problem
symptomatic of the vagueness of language,
which suggests that there is a
general
problem about how to talk about the emotion qualia.
6
There are
two viewpoints concerning the advocation of basic emotion sets: they are ei-
ther based on biologically primitive or psychologically irreducible emotions
(see Bann
16
for a detailed discussion).
Barrett’s work
7
studied the act of conceptualising core affect,
in other
words,
why people attach emotion labels
to the experience of
emotion
qualia. She proposed the hypothesis that emotion is a psychological event
constructed from the basic elements core affect and conceptual knowledge.
In a study focusing on the conceptualisation of
fear ,
8
it was found that
neither the presence of accessible emotion concept knowledge nor core af-
fect alone was sufficient to produce the (world-focused) experience of fear.
As emotions are constructed from conceptual
knowledge about the world,
we can see that emotions themselves are concepts that human beings begin
learning in infancy and continuously extend and revise throughout life.

Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012

This repeated experience of labelling a combination of core affect and the
context in which it occurs as an emotion provides “training” in how to
recognise and respond to that emotion;
in this sense,
Barrett described
emotions as “simulations”.
This “skill” of
conceptualising core affect as
an emotion might be a core aspect of
emotional
intelligence — in much
the same way as conceptual
thinking is core to cognitive intelligence —
defining how humans deal with their internal state, but more importantly,
defining the emotion labels used as a combination of specific experiences.
Each person’s conceptualisation of their emotion spectrum is thus unique;
it is this conceptualisation that we attempt to aggregate and analyse in this
research.
Emotions can be expressed in a variety of ways including facial expres-
sions,
body language,
tone of voice,
and the language used in speech and
text. This research focuses on the most explicit of these — the language used
in communication — with the proposition that how humans communicate
to one another can reveal individual conceptualisations of specific emotions,
given that the specific emotion keyword is used within the communication.
Defining basic emotions as emotions that are conceptually distinct from any
other emotion,
we explore the hypothesis that the language used in com-
municating basic emotions should be significantly different for each one, as
each basic emotion should describe a significantly distinct concept.
3.
Semantic Analysis
Over the past few decades there has been significant evidence that peo-
ple’s psychological
aspects can be predicted through analysis of
language
style.
One notable example is Rosenberg’s work on verbal
behavior and
schizophrenia.
17
He found that,
while the speech of those diagnosed with
schizophrenia did not differ from unaffected people on the structural level,
it did differ on the semantic level, i.e. with regard to the thematic concerns
that were being addressed. It is this deviation from expected thematic con-
cerns, which are linked to general and sex-specific social role expectations,
that is associated with the diagnosis of
schizophrenia.
17
Analysis of
lan-
guage semantics has been used extensively in research, including discover-
ing individual
differences in personality,
18
lie detection
19
and discovering
individual differences in beliefs.
20
With respect to emotion analysis, French
found that co-occurrence techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis does
not detect personality from short text samples,
21
but do reveal that texts
expressing particular emotions have a greater semantic similarity to corre-
sponding exemplar words.
22

Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012

By analysing the semantics, specifically, co-occurrence statistics, of the
language expressing individual
emotion keywords,
we can discern those
emotions that are similar and those that are distinct. We postulate that sim-
ilar emotions are represented by similar semantics, and propose to cluster
emotional documents based on the underlying meanings of each document.
3.1.
Latent Semantic Analysis
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
23
is a variant of the vector space model
that aims to create a semantic space by means of dimensionality reduction
techniques and has been widely used in a variety of domains, from document
indexing to essay grading.
It has also been used in emotion classification
of news headlines, performing better than Na¨ıve Bayes in the case of recall
but not as good as WordNet in terms of
precision.
24
Given a raw co-
occurrence matrix M using the entire vocabulary as B, this is transformed
by A (the documented function for LSA is log-entropy normalisation), and
M is applied to reduce dimensionality.
There are several
techniques for M that reduce the dimensionality of
words constituting the semantic space,
the original
method documented
for LSA being Partial Singular Value Decomposition (PSVD). PSVD uses
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the data matrix M into
the product of three matrices:
M = TΣD
T
(1)
where T is the term matrix, D is the document matrix and Σ is a diagonal
matrix with singular values sorted in decreasing order that act as scaling
factors that identify the varience in each dimension. LSA uses a truncated
SVD,
keeping only the k largest singular values in Σ and their associated
vectors:
M ≈ M
k
= T
k
Σ
k
D
T
k
(2)
This reduced-dimension SVD, or PSVD, M
k
, is the best approximation to
M with k parameters,
and is what LSA uses for its semantic space.
The
rows in D
k
are the document vectors and the rows in T
k
are the term
vectors in LSA space.

The Emotional Twitter Corpus
Twitter is a public micro-blogging system that allows users to share short
messages of up to 140 characters and, as these are publicly available, pro-

Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012

vides us with an ethical way of collecting a diverse range of public expres-
sions.
Coupled with the fact that a good proportion of tweets project the
user’s emotion — indeed,
French found that some emotions,
particularly
those with strongly marked valence, can be accurately expressed and per-
ceived in short blog excerpts
25
— we are able to assume that Twitter is a
valid sample of human emotive expression and thus a suitable corpus for
this project. There is somewhat of an explicit impulse to communicate emo-
tions on Twitter and although the underlying cause is not always explicitly
mentioned,
it is this factor that we attempt to capture.
Our experiences
tested a collection of six basic emotion theories as described in Table 1 (see
Bann
16
for details of our selection method).

Emotion Keywords
The extraction mechanism and the selection of keywords to be mined from
Twitter would form the structure of our eventual
emotion corpus.
Taking
the union of
all
the emotion sets identified for analysis,
we obtained a
set of
21 unique emotion keywords,
which,
theoretically,
constitutes the
most distinct emotions. We extract unigrams created using the first person
grammatical inflection of each keyword, similar to Russell,
26
as most tweets
will contain this type of inflection: “I am very excited today” as opposed
to “I am feeling excitement today”. This was chosen as opposed to mining
for bigrams, for example “feeling excited”, “feel excited” and “felt excited”,
as this resulted in far fewer tweets being returned due to Twitter’s indexing
focusing on single keywords. Moreover, tweets containing quantifiers would
E. Y. Bann and J. J. Bryson
Proceedings of the 13th Neural
Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012
7
have been ignored if we chose to extract bigrams, for example “feeling very
excited”.
Contrary to Bollen’s work,
27
we did not require tweets to contain the
words ‘feel’, ‘I’m’, ‘Im’, ‘am’, ‘being’, and ‘be’, as an explicit mention of an
emotion keyword would be sufficient to describe an experience of that emo-
tion, reinforced by the fact that we will only be mining for the first person
grammatical
inflection of each keyword.
We filtered out re-tweets — min-
imising duplicates — and negative tweets, because, for example, ‘happy’
6
=
‘not happy’ ; nor can we assume that ‘not sad’ = ‘happy’. Tweets containing
popular phrases which include “Happy Birthday” and “Angry Birds” were
also filtered out. Initially, @ tags were not filtered, but we quickly realised
that these tweets refer to messages either closely relating to other people or
as part of a thread of messages;
thus we filtered them out as the emotion
expressed within such tweets did not describe an atomic emotional experi-
ence.We did not Porter stem collected words as Kim
28
notes that this might
hide important semantic differences, for example, conceptual differences be-
tween loved and loving. To optimally harvest emotions, we substituted fear
with scared as it was proven to be the most popular keyword out of scared,
frightened and afraid. We also substituted distressed with stressed, due to
an extremely low stream rate for this keyword (see Bann
16
for a detailed
description of keywords).
4.2.
Emotion Streaming
A PHP script was created that used the Gardenhose Level Twitter Stream-
ing API — a streaming sample of about 10% of all public status updates on
Twitter — that allows tracking of up to 400 keywords. We collected tweets
that contained each of the selected emotion keywords, storing those which
do not include a filtered phrase into a MySQL database. We programmed
the PHP script to be cyclical in the sense that it streamed individual tweets,
but changed emotion keywords every 5 minutes in order to collect the whole
range of emotions. Ten days of data collection resulted in a labelled Tempo-
ral Emotion Database containing six emotion theories totaling to 21 unique
emotion keywords each with at least 1100 documents to base our analysis
on. It should be noted that by using WordNet
29
we could have expanded
our initial
list of
21 keywords by taking synonyms of
each keyword and
testing the stream rate for each emotion,
selecting the most popular key-
word; however in order to fairly test each theory, we opted against this as
the selected emotion keywords had been carefully chosen by each theorist.

Semantic Emotion Analysis
Having created an emotional Twitter corpus, we analysed this data in or-
der to evaluate the semantic distinctiveness of existing basic emotion sets,
developing an iterative latent semantic clustering algorithm to discern the
optimal semantically irreducible basic emotion set from all 21 emotions col-
lected.
Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC) is a simple modification of
the
LSA algorithm which we base our DELSAR algorithm on. Given a labelled
corpus C with label set K, it calculates, using LSA, the semantic accuracy
of each label ∈ K, thus providing an analysis of how distinct the labelling
of C and the selection of K is. All analysis was performed on an Intel Core
2 U7700 CPU 2x1.33GHz with 2GB RAM using the gensim framework for
Python
30
to create LSA spaces.
Unless specified,
we tested dimensions of
the LSA space in increments of 10 and selected the dimensionality that per-
formed optimally for each task, similar to Recchia.
31
For all tasks, we use
Log-Entropy normalisation as our Association Function, found to generate
optimal results
32
and recommended for LSA.
23
5.1.
DELSAR
Document-Emotion Latent
Semantic
Algorithmic
Reducer
(DELSAR)
takes an emotion set and clusters each document’s emotion to the emotion
of its closest document vector (excluding itself), calculating a clustering ac-
curacy for each emotion. The closest document vector is calculated as the
maximum cosine value of the angle between the current document and each
other document in the subcorpus. The emotion keyword in each document
is removed before the closest document vector is calculated,
so we focus
purely on the words surrounding the emotion keyword for each document.
DELSAR operates in the LSA space created from the subcorpus of all doc-
uments matching all emotion keywords in the set being analysed, in which
there are (doc limit × number of emotions) documents.
If a document expressing a certain emotion,
e,
is not clustered with a
document of the same emotion, then the words surrounding e is more similar
to the words surrounding another emotion. Thus the clustering accuracy of
an emotion set corresponds to how distinct that emotion set is;
the more
semantically accurate an emotion set is,
the more distinct the language
surrounding each emotion within the set is.
The reduction aspect of DELSAR initially starts with the set of all 21
emotions.
After calculating the clustering accuracies for each emotion,
it
removes the least accurate emotion from the set and iterates until
there

Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012
9
are n emotions remaining in the initial set, resulting in the optimal seman-
tically distinct basic emotion set.
The DELSAR algorithm is described in
Algorithm 5.1.

then

end if
We performed DELSAR1000 on the corpus and various subcorpora and
report the results in Table 2. Note that DELSAR creates an LSA space of
all documents within each emotion set; for each basic emotion set an LSA
space of
(1000 × number of emotions) documents is created.
Evaluating
all
sets,
our results show the accuracy of clustering each document to its
nearest document,
whether it is the same or another emotion.
Of
all
the
theories analysed, Ekman’s set proved to be the most semantically distinct,
with a 2.9% increase in accuracy compared to the average of the remaining
sets.
Russell’s categories performed worst,
which is surprising seeing as
these emotions were taken as the basis for representing the entire emotion
spectrum as a whole.

This set achieved a significant increase in terms of
accuracy over Ek-
man’s set of
6.1%;
we could say that these emotions best represent the
emotion spectrum in its entirety, or in other words, the remaining emotions
could be expressed as a combination or a particular degree of intensity of
these emotions.
In addition to performing DELSAR1000,
we tested four subcorpora of
varying document sizes to observe any temporal effects and found negligible
temporal variance within our results.

5.2.
ELSA
While DELSAR is highly effective,
its analysis is relative to a subcorpus
of documents that express all
the emotions contained within a particular
basic emotion set — whilst it is a good measure of showing how distinct a
particular emotion set is overall,
it does not allow for each emotion to be
mutually independent. This is important to take into consideration as it al-
lows us to compare emotions without the constraint of it being in a set with
other emotions — for example an emotion within a set may be considered
distinct only because other emotions within the set are not. Emotional La-
tent Semantic Analysis (ELSA) is a modified version of DELSAR, in which
emotions are treated separately from one another. ELSA takes the set of all
E. Y. Bann and J. J. Bryson
Proceedings of the 13th Neural
Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012
11
21 emotions and, for each emotion, creates an LSA space using documents
matching only that particular emotion, in which there are (doc limit) doc-
uments.
For each ELSA space,
the cosine value for the closest document
vector to each document is determined,
and an average of these is calcu-
lated.
The higher this average value is for a specific emotion,
the more
similar the documents are for that emotion,
in other words,
the emotion
cluster is tightly packed. Lower values mean less similar words being used
in the expression of the same emotion — the emotion cluster is more dis-
persed — signifying a decrease in distinctiveness.
The difference between
ELSA and DELSAR, is that the latter evaluates whether a particular emo-
tion set
is representative of
the entire emotion spectrum,
as opposed to
seeing which emotions are distinct.
Evaluating each basic emotion set according to ELSA is simply a mat-
ter of averaging the corresponding values of the constituent emotions, and
discerning the most semantically distinct emotions requires selecting the
emotions with maximum average values. The ELSA algorithm is described
in Algorithm 5.2.
Algorithm 5.2

Corpus C and Keyword Set K, where ∀document ∈ C ∃document →
emotion ∈ K

document(K) == emotion then
delete emotion in document
calculate cosine document similarity matrix of LSA(document, C)
Find closest document vector nearest where nearest 6= document
end if
end for each
return average(nearest)
end for each
We performed ELSA in a similar fashion to DELSAR — testing the
same copora — and report the results in Table 3.
Out of
all
the basic
emotion sets analysed, Tomkin’s set proved to contain the most semantically
concentrated emotions, although it must be pointed out that Tomkin’s set
is identical to Ekman’s set without the emotion sad and four other emotions
added; by swapping disgusted for contempt, Ekman’s set would have been
optimal at 0.747.

We obtained a slightly different optimal set consisting of the eight most
semantically distinct emotions compared to DELSAR,
taking away inter-
ested and sleepy and adding anxious and miserable:
accepting anxious ashamed contempt joyful miserable pleased
stressed
This set achieved a 1.9% increase in accuracy compared to Tomkin’s set.
We could say that this basic emotion set contains those emotions which are
the most atomic in the sense that the words surrounding these emotion
keywords are semantically concentrated;
people using these emotions are
more likely to be actually referring to these emotions due to the similarity of
language across all documents. Take happy as an example, which is the least
atomic emotion: being the least semantically concentrated means that the
language that people use when using the word happy varies the most, either
due to describing a great variety of things, being used in a great variety of
contexts, or varying perceptions of what the emotion happy actually means.

Conclusion
A vast majority of computer scientists tend to use Ekman’s basic emotion
set for emotion categorisation,
and it appears that,
semantically,
it is the
most distinct set, with a 2.9% increase in accuracy compared to the average
of the remaining sets. Using an iterative algorithm based on LSC, we have
discerned a set of eight (rather than Ekman’s six) basic emotion keywords
that have been calculated to be the most semantically distinct.
This set

Computation and Psychology Workshop (NCPW13), July 2012

performed better in all semantic tests than all of the basic emotion models
analysed, with a 6.1% increase in accuracy over Ekman’s basic emotion set,
providing evidence that by carefully selecting emotion keywords,
more of
the emotion spectrum can be accounted for.
It must be noted,
however,
that the lack of varience of surrounding words of identified basic emotions
may just depict a stricter consensus on the definition of the word, unrelated
to any emotional phenomenological hierarchy.
Emotions must be seen as relative to a specific domain;
it has been
recently shown that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally univer-
sal.
33
Basic emotions are ultimately not universal
and are correlated with
underlying thematic concerns within the corpus under analysis.
Ranking emotions and basic emotion sets using our algorithms according
to a metric of semantic distinctiveness allows us to compare the similarity
of compound emotions,
analyse the composite properties of emotions and
highlight how specific emotions interact with each other, with applications
ranging from clinical assessments to emotion engineering.
Emotion may contribute to evolution on a much grander scale than
previously thought.
Indeed,
Izard
13
suggests that the main component in
evolution could be Emotion Schemas, that is, evolution of actions through
imitative learning of specific emotions. Memetic theory states that the abil-
ity to imitate is the only requirement for language to occur in evolution,
and it has been shown in several studies that syntax and semantics emerge
spontaneously (for a discussion, see Blackmore
34
). Thus, by analysing lan-
guage we should be able to reverse-engineer the imitative mechanisms of
humans. Mapping such processes could shed light on an updated and, com-
bined with genetic algorithms, a more complete model of human evolution.
