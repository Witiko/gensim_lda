Abstract 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
present 
a 
novel 
approach 
using 
LDA 
(Latent 
Dirichlet 
Analysis, Blei, David, Andrew, Michael, 
and Jordan, 2003) to analyze synonym 
groups 
appearing 
in 
fixed 
frames 
containing Chinese locative phrases, such 
as [zái noun phrase (yǐ/zhī) shàng/xià/etc. 
biān/miàn/etc.], and to understand noun 
meanings related to the syntactic forms 
of 
locative 
phrases. 
We 
mapped 
the 
different noun phrases to their collocating 
synonym 
groups 
before 
we 
generated 
similarity 
comparison 
among 
different 
combinations. 
We 
collected 
locative 
phrases using 11 monosyllabic locative 
words 
and 
5 
locative 
compound-
formation patterns from Sketch Engine, 
and we aligned these compounds with 
Chinese Synonym Forest (Mei, Zhu, & 
Gao 1983) before clustering. A Hive Plot 
(Krzywinski, 
Birol, 
Jones, 
and 
Marra, 
2012) visualizer was constructed in order 
to 
help 
understand 
the 
relationship 
of 
locative nouns and their synonym groups. 
The results showed not only the semantic 
meaning 
within 
a 
locative 
phrase, 
but 
also 
the 
corresponding 
semantic 
meanings among locative phrases.

Introduction 
Locative 
phrases 
express 
the 
locative 
and 
directional information in relation to a certain 
object 
or 
entity. 
In 
Chinese, 
locative 
phrases 
have the following structure (Li and Thompson, 
1989, pp 390): 
zái noun phrase ~ (locative particle) 
‘at’ 
Within this structure, the locative particles can be 
monosyllabic 
or 
disyllabic 
compounding 
with 
prefixes, like yǐ and zhī, as well as suffixes, like 
biān, miàn, and tóu. (See Table 1). 
Many scholars have done research on locative 
phrases 
to 
understand 
the 
language 
context 
through frame 
reference (Hsu 
and Tai, 2001; 
Liang 
and 
Wang, 
2010) 
and 
image 
schema 
(Liang and Wang, 2010; Wang and Hsieh, 2011), 
but not on cross-comparing the different locative 
words with their suffix/prefix combinations.

In this study, we collected data from the Chinese 
Giga-word corpus
1
(Ma, and Huang, 2006) in 
Sketch Engine to retrieve the combinations of 
1
Giga-word corpus contains 2466840 news 
articles in Taiwan’s CNA and Mainland China’s 
XIN.
Chinese 
locative 
nouns 
in 
Table 
1, 
and 
we 
categorized each compound into synonym groups 
according 
to 
the 
categories 
provided 
by 
the 
Chinese 
Synonym 
Forest 
(Mei, 
et. 
al. 
1983) 
disregarding 
the 
part-of-speech 
information
2
. 
Then 
we 
adapted 
the 
LDA 
(Latent 
Dirichlet 
Analysis, Blei, et. al. 2003) methods to cluster 
each 
synonym 
group 
to 
extract 
meaningful 
groups of combinations existing in our data set. 
Instead of a network view, we used Hive Plot 
(Krzywinski, 
et. 
al. 
2012) 
to 
visualize 
the 
comparison 
result 
of 
each 
locative 
noun 
combination. 
The 
graphical 
decomposition 
of 
concept categories in locative phrases, hopefully, 
would benefit the analysis of Chinese locative 
nouns.

Methodology 
2.1
Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
The LDA model involves drawing samples from 
Dirichlet 
distributions 
and 
from 
multinomial 
distributions. 
This 
method 
is 
widely 
used 
in 
biomedical 
studies 
and 
can 
profile 
genes 
(Flaherty, Giaever, Kumm, Jordan, and Arkin, 
2005) by considering DNA sequences are simple 
4-letter 
combination 
(A, 
T, 
G, 
and 
C). 
The 
formally 
probabilistic 
generative 
process 
is 
defined (Blei and Lafferty, 2009) as: 
1.
For each topic k, draw a distribution over 
words




Dir
d
~
. 
2.
For each document d, 
a)
Draw a vector of topic 
proportions

b)
For each word i,

where K is a specified number of topics, V is the 
number of words in vocabulary; Dir(α) is a K-
dimensional Dirichlet; Dir(β) is a V-dimensional 
Dirichlet; and 
i
d
z
,
is the i-th word in the d-th 
document. 
2
The locative suffixes and prefixes are also 
interfered by the concept combination in locative 
phrases. Because lack of part-of-speech 
information in Chinese synonym forest, we can’t 
not create explicit formation for locative phrases.

latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). (
Nodes denote 
random variables; edges denote dependence between 
random 
variables. 
Shaded 
nodes 
denote 
observed 
random 
variables; 
unshaded 
nodes 
denote 
hidden 
random variables. The rectangular boxes are “plate 
notation,” which denote replication.) 
In large corpus experiments, LDA topic model 
can 
explain 
why 
some 
parts 
of 
the 
data 
are 
similar by observing different sets of 
various 
words’ 
probabilities 
in 
topics, 
such 
as 
arts, 
budgets, 
children 
and 
education

groups 
(Blei, et. al., 2003). 
2.2
Chinese Synonym Forest 
The Chinese Synonym Forest (or Chilin
同義詞
詞林
, Mei et al., 1983) is a collection of 5300 
Chinese 
synonyms. 
In 
this 
synonym 
forest, 
synonyms 
were 
categorized 
into 
3 
levels 
hierarchical 
groups. 
The 
top 
level 
of 
this 
hierarchy is the upper concept labeled from “A” 
to 
“L” 
including 
human, 
object, 
time/ 
space, 
abstract 
entities, 
characteristic, 
movements, 
psychological, phenomenon-condition, activities, 
relationship, 
auxiliaries, 
and 
honorifics, 
(see 
Appendix I). Within each top level, there are 
several middle and specific synonym groups, and 
each one has its own group code representing the 
hierarchical 
information 
and 
synonym 
relationship 
symbols: 
“=” 
means 
a 
semantic 
equal group, “#” means semantic unequal but in 
the same group, and “@” is a self-enclosed and 
independent group. The extended version of the 
Chinese Synonym Forest by the HIT IR Lab 
expended the original 3 level hierarchies to 5, 
deleted rarely usage words, and included 
modern 
words from news corpus. Table 2 (next page) 
shows 
several 
examples 
from 
the 
extended 
version (hereafter Chilin).
In Table 2, we can see that each synonym group 
has 
a 
unique 
code: 
the 
initial 
capital 
letter 
represents the top level concept, the last symbol 
represents 
the 
semantic 
relationship 
within 
a 
synonym group, and the other letters or numbers 
in between represent the position of a word in a 
synonym hierarchy.

Forest. (The synonym meanings are translated by 
the authors.)

This synonym list has two major problems while 
applying 
it 
in 
computation 
algorithm: 
first, 
because of the lack of clearly definition of each 
synonym 
group, we can only conjectured the 
meaning; second, because Chinese compounds 
have many senses, a word can be found in many 
synonym 
groups, 
such 
that
幌 子
huǎngzi 
(asterisked 
in 
Table

originally 
means 
‘signboard of hotel’ and it also commonly means 
‘brand’ 
(a 
metaphor 
when 
referring 
to 
performing an activity under the guise of the 
name). Despise the problems presenting above, 
Chilin is the state-of-art collection of synonym 
wordlist.

We used 11 directional words:

to 
collect data from the Chinese Giga-word corpus, 
and the results of locative nouns, disregarding 
the presents of

can be found in Table 3 below. 
The reason of excluding 
左
zuǒ,
右
yòu, 
內
nèi, 
中
zhōng is because these words cannot be found 
in all 5 prefixes/suffixes. 
Because the Chinese Giga-word corpus is a news 
corpus, we found that not all the combinations 
can be found. The usage of ~tóu is significantly 
lower than other formations in every locative 
word 
and 
statistics 
shows 
that 
the 
usages 
of 
shàng, xià, qián, hòu, lǐ, wài as prefixes of biān, 
as well as dōng, xī, nán, běi as suffixes of yǐ 
cannot be found in news corpus. Even dōng, xī, 
nán, 
běi 
as 
media 
addressing 
directional 
information are barely found using biān as suffix.

Clustering using LDA and Hive Plot 
Pustejovsky (1991:437) points out that “much of 
the lexical ambiguity of verbs and prepositions is 
eliminated because the semantic load is spread 
more evenly throughout the lexicon to the other 
lexical 
categories.” 
Here, 
we 
differentiate 
different 
uses 
of 
locative 
phrases 
through 
observing their groups of nouns in a fixed frame. 
In order to find the meanings corresponding to 
the locative nouns appearing in the fixed frame 
[zái 
noun 
phrase 
(yǐ/zhī) 
shàng/xià/etc. 
biān/miàn/etc.] in all combinations in Table 3 
above, we used LDA to cluster in the nouns 
appearing in each combination by first mapping 
each noun to its synonym group in Chilin. Before 
we 
used 
Chilin, 
we 
needed 
to 
translate 
the 
original 
synonym 
list 
which 
is 
in 
simplified 
Chinese into traditional encoding. In order to 
avoid 
any 
translation 
problems, 
we 
uses 
Simplified/Traditional Chinese conversion table
3
with 
maximum 
matching 
phrases 
for 
the 
conversion. In our study, in order to retrieve the 
patterns in Table 3, we used zái as a keyword to 
locate 
any 
fixed 
locative 
phrases. 
Thus, 
the 
pattern we are looking for is [zái noun phrase 
(yǐ/zhī) shàng/xià/etc. biān/miàn/etc.]. To locate 
this pattern, we searched for occurrences of zái 
within the left window size of 3 from all locative 
compounds. When mapping each compound onto 
the synonym group codes, some compounds may 
be located in more than one synonym group. We 
enlisted all synonym group codes before doing 
LDA 
process, 
because

synonym code) to be multinomial distribution to 
each specific topic (see in 2.1). While clustering 
each mapped locative phrase containing several 
translated synonym group codes into topics, each 
topic 
(or cluster) also 
presents 
a 
multinomial 
distribution. 
While 
clustering, 
we 
set 
the 
minimum data set to 5 to filter out xià tóu and xī 
tóu, 
and 
commanded 
LDA 
to 
cluster 
each 
locative phrase in to 5 topics with parameters 
chunk-size at 10% of dataset during 20 passes. 
The selected results as follows:

LDA 
creates 
5 
clusters 
according 
to 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
existing 
synonym 
groups. 
Because 
all 
information, 
including 
parts 
of 
speech, were inputted into LDA, if a part of 
speech is considered more prominent by LDA (as 
in 0.152*1-/Nb above where the initial is marked 
with a “/”), the part of speech will be listed as 
one of the most important features of a particular 
cluster. The elements without the “/” represent 
the Chilin synonym group codes. 
However, the results in Table 4 are hard to us to 
recognize 
the 
patterns 
of 
correlation 
between 
synonym groups and parts of speech in locative 
nouns. 
Therefore 
we 
adapted 
the 
Hive 
Plot 
(Krzywinski, et al, 2012) method to construct a 
network viewer for comparison by using each 
coefficient weight larger than 0.05 (Figure 2). 
Furthermore, we also incorporated the synonym-
group-occurring 
frequency 
into 
the 
Hive 
Plot 
diagram 
if 
this 
occurring 
frequency 
ratio 
is 
higher than 0.005 within each pattern. As the 
occurring 
frequency 
represents 
the 
most 
prominent pattern in each locative phrase, the 
LDA 
topic 
coefficients 
are 
able 
to 
show 
the 
significant differences among topics with each 
locative prefix/suffix formation. 
In our study, we used GENSIM (Řehůřek and 
Sojka, 
2010) 
library 
to 
perform 
the 
LDA 
clustering 
of 
the 
essential 
synonym 
groups 
appearing 
in 
different 
formations 
of 
locative 
nouns, and we analyzed the coefficient within 
each generating groups.

In Figure 2, we used the Hive Plot to integrate 
information 
of 
LDA 
clusters 
and 
Chilin 
hierarchy within an interactive diagram for 5 
patterns of locative noun formations. The upper 
left drop-down bar shows the select function, and 
the bottom text provides the basic statistics of the 
current 
diagram. 
There 
are 
3 
axes 
in 
each 
diagram: the upward axis is the pattern we used 
in LDA (the top two nodes are prefixes and the 
last three are suffixes); the right-downward axis 
is 
the 
mapped 
(sub)synonym 
groups 
(green 
nodes)

or P.O.S tag (pink nodes) in the LDA 
topics or high occurring frequency nodes; and the 
left-downward axis is the upper-level synonym 
groups (red nodes) and the initial letter of P.O.S 
tags 
(the 
coarse 
categories 
of 
‘N’, 
‘V’, 
etc.) 
(brown 
nodes) 
corresponding 
to 
the 
nodes 
locating in right-downward axis. 
Each node in the upward axis represents a single 
LDA clustering processing, which processes all 
locative nouns matching the node label (e.g., all 
patterns containing biān) , and the links (grey) 
represent the aggregated coefficient (weighting) 
of 
each 
clustered 
topic. 
While

Prefixes/Suffixes of Locative Nouns 
In order to understand the locative phrases, it is 
necessary to provide some of the meanings of the 
prefixes/suffixes in this section. Noun phrases 
are appearing in the fixed frame [zái~ (yǐ/zhī) 
shàng/xià/etc. biān/miàn/etc.] may occur with 5 
prefixes/suffixes: 
～
邊
biān, 
～
面
miàn, 
～
頭
tóu, 
以
yǐ
～
, 
之
zhī
～
. Each prefix/suffix word 
has 
its 
specific 
meaning, 
according 
to 
http://www.zdic.net/. Biān means “edge, margin, 
side, border”, miàn means “face; surface; plane; 
side, dimension”, tóu means “head; top; chief, 
first; boss”, yǐ means “by means of; thereby, 
therefore; 
consider 
as; 
in 
order 
to”, 
and 
zhī 
means “marks preceding phrase as modifier of 
following phrase; it, him/her, them; go to”. When 
these 
prefixes/suffixes 
form 
compounds 
with 
locative words such as zái, they can be used to 
describe the locative information of time/space 
and abstract entity (Figure 3), as well as object, 
and characteristics (Figure 4), for example.

běi), such as “
上面
”(shàng miàn), 
and “
以下
”(yǐ xià). 
When 
expressing 
location 
information 
of 
the 
synonym group object (in Figure 4), the data 
showed that nouns compounding with all prefix 
patterns (biān, miàn, tóu) and the suffix pattern 
of 
yǐ 
are 
significant, 
because 
these 
physical 
features like “edge”, “surface”, and “top” can 
only be found in the physical existence of objects. 
And the connection of zhī is not presenting in 
Figure 
4, 
because 
of 
less 
frequent 
and 
not 
significant in LDA clusters. Similar to object the 
synonym group called characteristics is an upper 
group 
of 
shape, 
appearance, 
color/taste 
for 
physical 
objects, 
and 
nature, 
moral, 
circumstances, 
and 
others 
for 
abstract 
events. 
Therefore, all prefix patterns (biān, miàn, tóu) 
can 
be 
used 
while 
expressing 
the 
locative 
information related to physical objects. As to the 
prefix formation of zhī, it usually modifies the 
features of abstract events. More examples like 
human and movement are presenting in Figure 5. 
Figure 5 Connections of human and movements 
When referring to directional information about 
human, linkage to sub-synonym (green nodes) 
groups such as occupation or social positions 
(labors, land lord, loyal families, and etc.) were 
seen. Data also show that only yǐ, tóu, and miàn 
are found in corpora. Considering the meaning of 
tóu and miàn, it is clear to find “face” and “head” 
senses of human. Another interesting finding is 
the 
linkage 
of 
activities 
to 
head 
movements 
(kissing, blinking, listening, biting … and etc.) 
and to miàn. 
3.2
Directional Words 
In this section, we analyzed 11 directional words 
(excluding zuǒ, yòu, nèi, zhōng but including two 
forms of 
裡
/
裏
lǐ; cf. Table 1), and we also used 
the same setting in 3.1 (using LDA model to 
create 
5-topic 
clusters 
and 
combining 
most 
frequent synonym groups to plot Hive diagram). 
After 
mapping 
all 
noun 
phrases 
onto 
Chilin 
synonym 
groups, 
we 
used 
Hive 
Plot 
for 
interactive 
investigation 
and 
we 
enlisted 
the 
selected results in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Results of comparing directional words. 
(a) focuses on phenomenon-condition; (b) 
focuses on psychology; (c) focuses on human; (e) 
focuses on appearance; (f) focuses on sin 
activities 
In 
Figure 
6, 
we 
show 
differences 
when 
comparing directional words in the LDA results,. 
We 
selected 
some 
interesting 
patterns 
for 
discussion, 
as 
follows: 
in 
Figure 
6(a), 
phenomenon-condition (including sub-synonym 
groups) is not connected to dōng, xi, nán, běi, 
because it is awkward to address any direction of 
a phenomenon or conditio; in (b), psychology 
nouns exclusively use
裡
/
裏
lǐ and 
外
wài, such 
as “
在
發現
裡面
” (discover something inside..) 
and “
在
支持
之外
” (besides supporting); in (c), 
human nouns only show the usage of
前
qián “
在
民眾
之前
”(before citizens). In Figure 6(e), if we 
observed the nodes on the right-downward axis, 
we 
can find 
even 
more interesting 
usages 
of 
directional nouns. For example, only
前
qián and 
後
hòu, such as “
在
明朗
之前
” (before event 
clear) and “
在
明朗
之後
”(after event clear), can 
be addressing appearance (sub-synonym groups 
are less, fertile, bare, dense, sparse, and etc.), as 
well as the only usage of sin activities and lǐ, 
such as “
在
治罪
條例
裡面
” (in offences 
ordinance), 
can 
be 
found 
in 
news 
corpora. 
Unfortunately, 
we 
cannot 
enlist 
all 
1,509 
relationships among 104 concepts in Hive Plot of 
all directional words. The above are just some 
interesting observations. 
3.3
Combination of Directional Words and 
Patterns 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
dig 
in 
each 
formation 
of 
directional 
words 
and 
prefixes/suffixes 
combination. We used the same method to create 
Hive 
Plot 
for 
each 
directional 
word 
and 
prefix/suffix formation pattern. We combined all 
statistical 
results 
of 
LDA 
and 
the 
occurring 
frequency of synonym groups using the same 
directional words. Similarly, in this paper, we 
just selected some findings for discussion. 
(A)
Time/space 
In 
Chilin 
synonym 
groups, 
time/space 
is 
the 
upper-level 
groups 
of 
time 
(its 
sub-synonym 
groups including: A.D., B.C., end of year, four 
seasons…and etc.) and space (its sub-synonym 
groups including: position, direction, neighbor-
hood, surrounding, etc.). Our data showed very 
interesting results while comparing each opposite 
direction in pairs (Figure 8). 
In Figure 7(a), we can see shàng is used in the 
suffix patterns (
zhī
and yǐ), and xià is used with 
the prefix biān and suffix yǐ. If we consider the 
semantic senses of biān – “edge, margin, side, 
border”, example like “
在
朝
/
往
下邊
” (To the 
following), 
it 
seems 
that 
xià 
biān 
shows 
a 
distance 
closer 
to 
an 
observed 
point. 
On the 
contrary, when addressing shàng, data showed 
that 
most 
uses 
ignored 
the 
distance 
with 
regarding to the observation point. In addition, in 
(b), we can see lǐ and wài are totally different. 
When expressing time/space in wài, just like all 
other directional nouns (qián, hòu, dōng, x
ī
, nán, 
běi), they are connected to every prefix/suffix 
pattern. 
As 
to 
lǐ, 
no 
matter 
its 
sub-synonym 
groups are time or space, we can find only one 
linkage 
to 
miàn 
which 
means 
“face; 
surface; 
plane; side, dimension”, such as “
在
時間
裡面
” 
(during that time). 
(a) focuses on time/space and comparing shàng, xià 
(b) focuses on time/space and comparing 
lǐ
and 
wài 
Figure 7 comparing time/space in pairs of 
directional words with opposite meanings 
(B)
Psychology 
In Chilin, psychology has only two sub-synonym 
groups, 
psychological 
activities 
and 
psycho-
logical 
status. 
However, 
we 
can 
only 
found 
psychological activities is connected in collected 
corpora. In Figure 2, we found that nouns in 
psychology 
synonym 
groups 
are 
usually 
used 
with biān, tóu, and miàn, and we could only find 
5 
linked 
graphs 
in 
every 
locative 
noun 
and 
pattern combination (Figure 8). 
(a)
(b) 
(c) (d) 
(e)
Figure 8 Connections of synonym 
group psychology 
in different locative nouns 
First, the synonym group psychology is linked to 
běi 
(a) 
and 
nán 
(b), 
and 
the 
linkages 
are 
relatively lower than other linkage weighting in 
the same graph, such as “
在
支持
中國
北邊
” 
(supporting northern China) and “
在
規劃
濁水
溪
以南
” (planning south of Zhuoshui River). 
When 
expressing 
locative 
information, 
psychology nouns use only suffix biān in our 
corpora. More significant results can be found in 
locative nouns lǐ, wài, and hòu. In Figure 8(c), 
when using locative noun lǐ to address directional 
information of synonym group psychology, we 
can only find evidences support using suffixes of 
biān, tóu, and miàn, but not with prefixes. The 
LDA result of no linkage to pattern node lǐ is 
different from all other graphs. In Figure 8(d), 
psychology 
nouns 
are 
relatively 
close 
to 
the 
observation of object because both use
wài biān 
instead of using suffixes tóu and miàn. In Figure 
8(e), locative information of psychology appears 
as abstract entities by using yǐ hòu. 
(C)
Example of Generating Locative Structure 
Although the complexity of analyzing Chinese 
locative nouns which accompany with 5 different 
suffixes and prefixes, it is possible to generate 
locative structure for a locative nouns. We take 
裡
lǐ 
as 
an 
example. 
In 
Figure 
7(b), 
while 
addressing concept regarding to time/space, the 
frequency of using suffix combination, miàn, is 
significant in diagram, and the usage of miàn 
only 
can 
be 
found 
in 
compounds 
in 
space 
category, if we look into right-downward axis 
(sub-synonym groups).(Figure 9) 
Figure 9 Connections of sub-synonym 
groups, time 
and space, to different locative nouns 
The 
translations 
of 
using 
lǐ 
miàn 
and 
lǐ 
are 
different, because the translated senses depend 
on the concept before locative nouns (here, one is 
time period, and the other is space). For example, 
“
夏日
” is compounds addressing summer days 
and be collected in times category, therefore “
在
夏日
裡
” is translated into “in/during summer 
days”. As to space, locative nouns like “
在
城市
裡面
” can be translated into “in/inside city”, 
other suffixes and prefixes, such as 
～
邊
biān,
～
頭
tóu, 
以
yǐ
～
, 
之
zhī
～
, are rarely found in 
corpus.

Conclusions 
Locative 
phrases 
are 
formatted 
compounds 
which contain 
directional 
nouns and 
referring 
scope at the same time. The combinations of 
locative phrases are difficult for us to analyzing 
the formation and to establish formal rules for 
representation 
and 
composition 
for 
locative 
nouns. Our study tries to re-categorize all nouns 
appearing in a certain fixed frame. The semantic 
meaning of the nouns can be seen in our study by 
observing their concepts. Instead of using human 
judgments, we propose a novel method by using 
LDA model and its clustered topics parameters, 
as well as integrating the statistical frequency 
and 
Chinese 
Synonym 
Forest 
hierarchical 
information to inspect the differences between 
locative 
nouns 
and 
prefix/suffix 
formation 
through Hive Plot interface. In this study, we 
discover 
several 
findings 
regarding 
locative 
nouns 
and 
syntactic 
locative 
phrases 
using 
synonyms nouns. Our study is limited by the 
news 
genre 
of 
Giga-word 
corpus 
in 
Sketch 
Engine. It is possible to use different machine 
learning mechanisms, and to adapt interactive 
visual investigating method to help us understand 
(a)
Psychology to běi, 
(b)
Psychology to nán, 
(c)
Psychology to lǐ, 
(d)
Psychology to wài, 
(e)
Psychology to hòu, 
more 
relationships 
beyond 
statistical 
data. 
As 
Pustesjovsky 
(1995:26) 
points 
out 
that 
“the 
ways in which words carry multiple meanings 
can vary”, by observing the nouns in a fixed 
frame, 
we 
can 
see 
how 
different, 
and 
some 
closely-related, 
locative 
phrases 
vary 
in 
their 
concepts.
