AGGLOMERATIVE CLUSTERING USING COSINE 
AND JACCARD DISTANCES: A COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH 
TO ROMAN VESSEL TAXONOMY
1. Introduction
When it comes to the comparison of ceramic finds from different archae-
ological projects, categorization can be problematic. Researchers incorporating 
older data into current questions are faced with the task of comparing finds 
which may have been classified or typed according to different criteria. After 
all, different methods, even applied to the same body of evidence, potentially 
result in different conclusions. The development of new classes and typologies 
over time also means that older data will inevitably have to be related to the 
current system in place through a series of concordances, which can take 
considerable effort to produce, especially for large collections of material.
In this paper, I offer a computational method to the categorization of 
vessels finds as an efficient way to deal with the problem of discrepant systems 
of classes and types. Each vessel artifact (or artifact-type) is described as a set 
of its component semantic attributes. The semantic distance between these 
sets can then be measured, and proximate sets clustered into new categories. 
The result is a framework of algorithmically derived categories to which 
vessel-types can be assigned, thereby ensuring standardized cross-project 
comparison.
This method is inspired by Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et 
al. 1990), and is based on the creation of semantic sets of vessel-types, which 
are then compared to associate similar sets to one another, using two differ-
ent ways to assess their associative distance. The first metric is the Jaccard 
index, which directly measures the degree of similarity between two sets. The 
second is the cosine similarity, which measures the angular distance between 
two different vectors, in this case, produced from the vessel sets. These two 
methods are used as a check on one another, to assess the integrity of the 
synthetic categories found by hierarchical clustering with Ward’s minimum 
variance method. To summarize, this paper presents a method to effectively 
and flexibly relate different vessel classes and types to one another, creating 
a baseline for inter-project comparison of finds that are categorized under 
different rubrics.
By way of an example, this algorithm is applied to a small dataset 
containing 1,492 entries of vessel-types, drawn from various excavations 
in Italy, focusing on but not limited to the period of the Roman Republic. 
In general, the algorithm successfully assigned vessels to new groups, and

final adjustments to the cluster assignment could be undertaken manually. 
In this regard, visual inspection of hierarchical dendrograms is a useful step 
in obtaining a sound re-categorization. In addition, post-procedural analysis 
of categorical ambiguity was also performed to assess ambiguity in cluster 
assignment.
This article presents the pilot dataset and algorithm of the open-source 
project synthkat, an initiative aimed at computational means to construct 
synthetic categories of archaeological ceramic and glass vessels, written in 
Python (version 3.4.3). The project files and data used to illustrate this method 
are available at https://github.com/scollinselliott/synthkat/. Initial data pro-
cessing was expedited by way of a pilot script in Python that processed raw 
.csv files as input, and then produced an output of documents in .json, .csv, 
and .txt format. The synthkat script was based on the topic-modeling package 
gensim (R
˘
ehu˚r˘ek, Sojka 2010), as well as numpy and scipy. Plots were made 
using the package matplotlib for Python (Hunter 2007). Dendrograms were 
plotted with the assistance of code written by Jörn Hees

2. Semantics and vessel taxonomy
The study of ceramic vessels of Roman Italy abounds in classifications 
and typologies, most of which have developed organically from the nine-
teenth century onward (Gandolfi 2005). While the boundaries between 
certain classes are fairly clear, such as lamps and transport amphorae, those 
between other classes can be less clear. Common ware(s), for example, rep-
resents one of the most difficult classes to treat, a category manifested in 
large part in negative terms and vaguely associated with cookware (Bats 
1996; Cortese 2005; Santoro Bianchi 2005). Sometimes, unslipped wares 
are divided by the composition of the clay, inclusions, and other mineral 
or chemical factors. At other times, the distinction is functional: the first 
division is between vessels which were used in the consumption or storage 
of food (ceramica da mensa or da dispensa) and those which were used 
in its cooking (ceramica da fuoco or da cucina). Mortaria and other large 
storage containers in opus doliare may at times be distinguished from other 
common ware. A concordance is necessary to relate these different vessel 
classes with one another.
After all, there will always be slight differences in the organization and 
arrangement of classes that require steps to be taken to ensure concordance. 
For example, in the case of comparing en masse the vessels finds from two 
excavations published five years apart – those at Fiesole on the Via Marini (de

Marinis 1990) and those at Settefinestre (Ricci 1985) – finds would have to 
be re-classified: classes such as ceramica acroma depurata and ceramica acroma 
grezza from Fiesole are congruent with the ceramica comune of Settefinestre 
(Table 1). The task of translation is even more obvious when working across 
languages, considering the comparison of “kitchen ware,” “coarse ware,” or 
“domestic ware” (Dyson 1976), with ceramica da cucina, da fuoco, grezza, 
da mensa, or da dispensa. In sharp contrast to the ordinary and quotidian 
use of these vessels in their actual, systemic context, the semantics of their 
archaeological definition seem profound.
Moreover, tracing the progress of research will show that classes and 
types come into and fall out of use over time. Grey-gloss ceramics, for 
example, have only been recognized as a class separate from black gloss 
since 1980 (Giardino 1980; Vittoria 2011). Black-gloss Campanian B, as 
originally articulated by Nino Lamboglia, is an example of subclass in crisis. 
At first it was thought to have been produced only in Etruria, but currently 
it appears that the production of Campana B ceramics was widespread 
throughout Italy and the western Mediterranean (Lamboglia 1952, 140-
142; Morel 1998a, 237-239; Morel 1998b, 12-15; Cibecchini, Principal 
2004; Olcese 2006, 528). “Pre-sigillata” is a term now deprecated, though 
the present and future cannot erase its use in past publications (Ettlinger 
et al. 1990, 4). Even though the way in which older materials have been 
classified and typed might be “outdated,” they should not be disregarded 
on account of obsolescence. Archaeology is, after all, the recovery of ob-
solete materials, and it would be both ironic and sad to discard the results 
of prior generations.
Thus, anyone who wishes to compare finds from one project with 
another has to become a sort of translator, who would have to develop 
a series of concordances, catch-as-catch-can, that relate different classes 
and types to one another (Table 1). This approach is business as usual, 
in re-identifying and re-typing archaeological finds, of relating similar to 
similar. However, the larger the dataset, the more prohibitive the rewards 
of this exercise would be. This is where the use of a computational method 
becomes helpful. But in order to deal computationally with ceramic vessel 
taxonomy, it is necessary to put that meaning in a language a computer can 
understand: mathematics.
Setting aside the deep but venerable nuances of the terms “class”, “type,” 
or “group” (Steward 1954; Shepard 1956; Rice 1987, 274-288; Read 
2007; Reynolds 2008, 82), mathematically, the basic concept at work is one 
of sets: what classification and typology have in common is the essential act 
of grouping elements (here, the vessels or vessel fragments) into sets (a class 
or type), on the basis of a criterion. That criterion has been, is, and will be 
subject to variation, predicated now on physical properties or characteristics

of the clay or slip, now on morphology, as derived either from traditional 
or common-sense traditional categories or aesthetic-rational aspects of the 
vessel design. In the case of Roman ceramics in Italy, at least, classification 
has tended to describe the technical-functional divisions among vessel man-
ufactures, while typology has tended to refer to morphological-functional 
variations within classes. Yet, any process of classification or typology is, in 
effect, a reduction of the object down to its constituent semantic components, 
11

to compare it with another object’s semiotic system, the notion of the type or 
class to which it is attributed.
Thus, typing or classing vessels is nothing more than establishing links 
between the object itself and an ideal class or type, itself formed by compari-
sons with other artifacts. Breaking down this process mathematically in terms 
of set theory, the process of identifying a sherd representing a vessel-type as 
belonging to a particular class or type can be construed as the creation of a 
set A with any number n of attributes a
i
. For example, from excavations at 
Fiesole, Via Marini, the type VN.P3 is related to the Morel 2255/Lamboglia 
5 black-gloss plate (de Marinis 1990, 105). Expanding this record’s conno-
tations across different languages, one can derive an explicit set of attribute 
characteristics (Table 2). Increasing the connotations of the object renders it 
all the more relatable to other types or sets which share those attributes. This 
process is basically doing with meaning what chemical analysis does with the 
raw material of the vessel. Indeed, the chemical composition of the vessel can 
be construed as another attribute of the vessel itself.
I utilized two domains of semantic sets, one for vessel morphology, or 
form, and another for ware. The division of these two domains was necessary, 
as combining the two tended, in practice, to result in confused comparisons: 
experimentation with the algorithm and the high dimensionality of the dataset 
(see below) coerced dimensional reduction, which could be accomplished by 
limiting the use of certain terms to either vessel form or ware. Thus, separate 
synthetic categories were developed for these two different aspects of the 
vessel-type.
There are any different number of ways in which the composition of a 
semantic set has been articulated in past scholarship. It was a central point of 
discussion in processual archaeology, such as with James Deetz’s factemes and 
formemes, or David Clarke’s hierarchical taxonomy of cultural entities down 
to their constituent attributes (Deetz 1967; Clarke 1978; Preucel 2006, 
101-109; cfr. also Ramazzotti 2010). Unlike Clarke’s definition, however,

that attributes are the smallest unit, a «logically irreducible character of two 
or more states, acting as an independent variable within a specific frame of 
reference» (Clarke 1978, 156), it must be recognized that attributes cannot 
by themselves be “logically irreducible”. They are bound by the very process of 
interpretation and identification, which are logically reducible, since attribute 
identification must be subject to definition and explanation.
In other words, culture does not have a smallest particle. Attributes are 
not atomic. The frame of reference shifts. Even though the system of culture 
can be analogized as information systems, as Clarke sees it, it still does not 
make sense to reduce cultural information – ideas – to the level of a bit (Clarke 
1978, 88-91). Even ideas that one could argue are maximally reduced, like a 
color or a shape, or carination on a vessel wall still have a depth of meaning 
that is dependent on other factors within a cultural system. No single idea can 
exist in isolation, just as the definition of an attribute is inextricably bound to 
the meaning of the entire cultural system, and will always be logically reducible 
against the backdrop of some context. In this way, attributes that are used to 
identify the basic components of an artifact can be reducible or referable to 
other cultural components. Semiotics is an inescapable and self-perpetuating 
act; the full explicit articulation of the meaning of a vessel, or vessel fragment, 
ad absurdum, will never end.
The costs of the time spent in incorporating hierarchical systems of 
classification or typology, such as Jean-Paul Morel’s magisterial Céramique 
campanienne (Morel 1981), or along the lines of the Chronotype developed 
by Timothy E. Gregory and Nathan Myers for the Sydney Cyprus Survey 
Project (Meyer 2003; Moore 2008), proved to be excessive. Hierarchy after 
all mandates the ordering of the attribute set. For example, just taking VN.P1 
(a
0
) as a subset of black gloss (a
1
) would necessitate the creation of a tuple – a 
nested ordered pair – expressed as (a
0
,a
1
) = {{a
0
},{a
0
,a
1
}}, within the semantic 
set. Constructing hierarchies involves the introduction of yet more complex 
criteria, which, for the purposes of constructing new ceramic categories, 
would hinder comparison. Keeping each set at the level where all attributes 
are unnested, {a
0
,a
1
}, rather than nested, e.g., {{a
0
},{a
1
},{a
0
,a
1
},{{a
0
},{a
0
,a
1
}}}, 
lowers the costs of time and energy spent in data entry and computational 
work necessary to deal with these more complex entities.
3. A computational approach to synthetic classification
Proceeding from the creation of semantic sets for each vessel-type, the 
next step is to find a means of comparing them to one another and grouping 
like with like, building categories from the bottom up. Cluster analysis is 
used ultimately to locate and identify groupings, but there are many different 
methods available, and not all produced useful results. Initially, I focused on

replicating results analogous to topic identification using Latent Semantic 
Analysis (LSA), which is used in large-scale comparisons of textual corpora 
(Deerwester et al. 1990). In this regard, the first step consisted of the crea-
tion of a term-document matrix, in which each term represented a semantic 
attribute given to each vessel, and in which each document represented the 
vessel-type itself (Table 3). Following LSA in a banausic and unreflective way, 
though, posed certain problems. For example, term-document matrices are 
typically subjected to term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting 
(tf-idf), which weights the elements of the matrix proportional to the number 
of times it appears in each document, so rare terms are given more prominence 
than they would otherwise receive. Since each attribute appears only once in 
each semantic set for each vessel type, performing tf-idf would not seem to 
hold any particular theoretical validity.
Furthermore, singular value decomposition, which lies at the heart of 
LSA, did not elicit a particularly useful representation of the data (Fig. 1). 
Multiple attempts were made to select different vector spaces which would 
be amenable to a density-based clustering algorithm, such as DBSCAN and 
OPTICS (Ester et al. 1996; Ankerst et al. 1999; Kriegel et al. 2011). Yet, 
manipulation of the data at the level of the term-document matrix, selection of 
different vector spaces, and variation in the scale of the epsilon-neighborhood 
in each of the clustering methods, repeatedly failed to provide groupings that 
made sense as archaeological categories. These poor results were probably 
obtained due to the high-dimensional space of a sparse matrix (10,384 of 
2,584,144 entries in the term-document matrix generated from the pilot da-
taset were non-zero), as well as the overall shape of the semantic sets.
Therefore, I sought out alternative approaches that could still serve to 
measure the distance between the semantic sets and produce archaeologically 
meaningful clusters, notwithstanding the high dimension of the data matrix. 
Two methods were assessed that could be used to create a distance matrix, 
cosine similarity and the Jaccard index. Both methods were used as a check 
on the integrity of the results obtained from clustering, as each measures 
distance differently (Table 3).
Cosine similarity is a good measure for high-dimensional spaces, and 
thus is particularly appealing for the case of large datasets (cosine similarity 
is also germane to LSA, and is included as a feature in gensim). Taking two 
vectors in an n-dimensional space, the distance between vector A and B is 
measured as the cosine of the angle between the two:
Jaccard index.

The cosine similarity will have a value of 1 where two vectors have precise the same
angle, and a value of 0 when they are orthogonal to one another (as well as a value of
-1 when opposite, but this will not happen since we are working with non-negative
values such as here).
Taking as an example the six columns in the term-document
matrix in Table 3 as six vectors in a 43-dimensional space (the number of rows in the
matrix),
calculating the cosine similarity between each of the vectors will
produce
a

obtain a distance matrix,
the cosine similarity was subtracted from 1 such that 0

cosine similarity between each of the vectors will produce a 6 × 6 matrix 
of cosine similarities that records the angle between each vector. To obtain 
a distance matrix, the cosine similarity was subtracted from 1 such that 0 
indicates similarity, and 1 represents distance
2
. The distance matrix will be 
of the form:
Jaccard index.
Both methods were used as a check on the integrity of
the results
obtained from clustering, as each measures distance diﬀerently.
Cosine similarity is a good measure for high-dimensional spaces, and thus is par-
ticularly appealing for the case of large datasets (cosine similarity is also germane to
LSA, and is included in the gensim package). Taking two vectors in an
n
-dimensional
space, the distance between vector
A
and
B
is measured as the cosine of the angle
between the two:
cos
(
θ
) =
A
·
B
∥
A
∥∥
B
∥
The cosine similarity will have a value of 1 where two vectors have precise the same
angle, and a value of 0 when they are orthogonal to one another (as well as a value of
-1 when opposite, but this will not happen since we are working with non-negative
values such as here).
Taking as an example the six columns in the term-document
matrix in Table 3 as six vectors in a 43-dimensional space (the number of rows in the
matrix),
calculating the cosine similarity between each of the vectors will
produce
a
6
×
6
matrix of cosine similarities that records the angle between each vector. To
obtain a distance matrix,
the cosine similarity was subtracted from 1 such that 0
indicates similarity,
and 1 represents distance.

In implementing Ward’s method on the small pilot dataset that follows, 
dendrograms were used heuristically to find a cut-off distance for the opti-
mal number of clusters, and it is anticipated that the selection of cluster size 
will persist in being a point of considerable debate and interpretation. The 
following example, which uses pilot data from synthkat, illustrates the way 
in which deciding on the number of clusters should be done manually to en-
sure that the cluster groups make sense for an archaeological categorization.

The bulk of the pilot dataset used as a test case for the performance of 
the above method was collected from the published results of various projects 
(Guzzo 1970; Frova 1977; Bonghi Jovino 1985; Ricci 1985; de Marinis 
1990; Milanese 1993; Bilde, Poulsen 2008). The collection of vessel-types 
were based principally on, but were not limited to, classes and types that per-
tain to the last two centuries BCE. Collection and definition of semantic sets 
of vessel-types continues, and datasets are uploaded to https://github.com/
scollinselliott/synthkat/ as they become available. The pilot dataset fixed for 
this paper comprises a total number of 1,492 vessel-types. The total number of 
semantic terms used was 1,732, intentionally limited to increase inter-referen-
tiality between the different document-vectors in the pilot dataset: terms and 
types that were thought to have broad referentiality were included, whereas 
those that tended toward particularity (such as descriptions of clays, slip qual-
ity, finer morphological details) were, for this pilot dataset, avoided (Table 4).

the number of clusters (Fig. 3). The methodology for choosing the number 
of clusters is a particular problem in hierarchical cluster analysis, and com-
putational methods to determine cluster size can still defer to rules-of-thumb 
or ad hoc judgments, such as the “elbow method,” used to find the optimal 
numbers of clusters with respect to variance.
In light of the nature of this exercise, the resulting number of cluster 
groups should be roughly equivalent to the number of categories that one 
began with. If there were too few clusters, the ceramic categories become one 
undifferentiated mass, but too many will result in micro-categories whose 
boundaries might be semantically irrelevant or misleading (creating sharp 
21
Agglomerative clustering using cosine and Jaccard distances
distinctions between “plate” and “platter”, for instance). Here, I tried to adhere 
as closely as possible to a number of clusters that was roughly equivalent to 
the number of classificatory and/or morphological categories which were used 
in individual projects at the outset, such as the number of classes in Table 1. 
Setting an arbitrary maximum distance of 10 between clusters (for both the 
Jaccard and cosine distances) resulted in an output of 22-27 categorical clus-
ters for either form or ware (Table 4). The resulting dendrograms are given in 
Fig. 3. The full list of categorical assignments derived from the pilot dataset 
may be found on the project website.
Furthermore, it would be ideal if linkages produced from cosine and 
Jaccard distances resulted in equivalent groupings. In other words, the syn-
thetic categorization should not be affected by the selection of the method 
of measuring distance. A check on the integrity of the resulting categories 
was made by seeing whether or not there was any overlap in the member-
ships of ceramic entries when either cosine or Jaccard distances were used, 
that is, if there were any clusters k – here denoted k
cos(
θ
)
or k
Jaccard
depending 
on its measure – where 0 < Jaccard(k
cos(
θ
)
,k
Jaccard
) < 1, that is, if there was any 
overlap in the categorical membership of an entry. This check revealed that, 
while most categories were exclusive or identical in either measure, there 
were some where membership was ambiguous. This tended to be the case 
more in instances of vessel form, rather than vessel ware. Table 5 lists the 
different categories which possessed some ambiguity in terms of vessel-type 
membership.
Merging categories is one effective way to resolve this ambiguity. For 
the example of vessel ware: 2
cos(
θ
),w
and 3
cos(
θ
),w
were formed by entries of ce-
ramica comune tirrenica, ceramica grezza di importazione extraregionale (in 
this case, from Provence), and grezza ligure, all of which nomenclature were 
particular to the corpus of finds from the excavations in the cloister of San 
Silvestro in Genova (Milanese 1993). The cluster 17
cos(
θ
),w
was made up of 
various entries of unslipped coarse or common wares. These elements were 
grouped differently by the Jaccard difference, into two different clusters, 
7
Jaccard,w
and 15
Jaccard,w
. Accordingly, equalizing these two categories according 
to the Jaccard measure and those three categories according to the cosine 
distance resolves that issue.
The case of vessel form is more problematic. Very often it is a matter 
of just one or two entries that is falling into either one category or another, 
given the frequent approximation of Jaccard(k
cos(
θ
)
,k
Jaccard
) to either 0 or 1. 
This would indicate that only slight adjustment would have to be made to the 
categorization. One case where ambiguity was greater involved the categories 
11

,...,17
cos(
θ
),f
and 12
Jaccard,f
,...,15
Jaccard,f
. Directly examining the assignments 
made to each of these categories reveals that the Jaccard distance failed to 
elicit a reasonable categorization. 14

distance of 50, of vessel-type clusters based on form. Dendrogram on the left was based on cosine 
distances, that on the right on Jaccard distances.
beakers and saucepans together). The reason why such a clustering failed 
in this case is foremost that the quality of the semantic set for each of the 
elements in those sets was fairly poor, sometimes consisting of a single entry, 
which negatively impacted that vessel-type’s referentiality to other forms. 
Richer description of their semantic sets is necessary, such that it contains 
more non-unique elements shared by other elements of the entire corpus. The 
output is only as good as the input.
Additionally, the cut-off point could be adjusted to alter the maximum 
distance between clusters. In this case of vessel form, setting the maximum 
distance from 10 to 50 results in identical groupings according to both the 
cosine and Jaccard distance (even if the way such clusters are positioned 
hierarchically differs – see Fig. 4). The creation of fewer categories could be 
justified given a significant enough degree of ambiguity, but improvement of 
the quality of the semantic sets should be the initial step.
5. Conclusions
The approach presented here admits of considerable flexibility and re-
verses the traditional approach to vessel classification and typology, creating 
categories computationally from the bottom up. Since the algorithm produces 
a new categorization for different datasets, there is no limit to the way in 
which semantic sets can be constructed, even to serve particular intra- or 
23
Agglomerative clustering using cosine and Jaccard distances
sub-classificatory questions. Further work, beyond the scope of this article, 
includes the implementation of fuzzy sets (or soft categories) as a way to treat, 
computationally, the ambiguity in vessel categorization and comparison. LSA 
methods can likewise be explored to examine how well vessels finds may 
accord with a priori categories in existence. Additional measures, such as 
the Tanimoto distance (Rogers, Tanimoto 1960), can also be explored as a 
means to assess the differences between semantic sets.
While there should be a post-procedural check on categorical assignment, 
an algorithmic process can greatly expedite the assignment of ceramic finds 
to classificatory and morphological groups, enabling the accumulation of 
large-scale comparisons of ceramic vessel assemblages from multiple different 
projects that have used different taxonomic systems. The project synthkat 
offers a preliminary set of data, and the refinement and expansion of the 
semantic descriptions from the pilot dataset will improve the effectiveness 
of the clustering algorithm. Algorithmic means do not entail a complete re-
placement of traditional methods of vessel identification, but they assist in 
sorting and organizing a body of data at a level that would be impossible for 
a single individual or group to accomplish. It serves ultimately to help bridge 
the difficulty in working with older data, and in the inevitable difficulty that 
comes with translating and interpreting past data, since the knowledge ob-
tained today will inevitably run the same risk of obsolescence.

ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the issue of standardization in the cross-comparability of different 
vessel assemblages. It presents a computational method for building vessel categories from the 
bottom up, by comparing the specified attributes of a collection of vessel-types, and grouping 
like with like. Thus, it provides a platform for translating vessel data which may have been 
classified or divided by type using one taxonomy, bringing them into communication with 
those categorized by another. Two different methods of measuring the similarity among 
vessel-types – cosine similarity and the Jaccard index – are explored, toward providing a control 
on the resulting “synthetic” categories. An exploratory dataset, collected from published data 
of archaeological projects in Italy focusing on ceramic vessels of the last two centuries BCE, 
was used to test the performance of this approach. Project data and results are open source 
and are available online at https://github.com/scollinselliott/synthkat/.
