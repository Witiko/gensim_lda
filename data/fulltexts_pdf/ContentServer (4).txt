The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is the largest known superfamily
of secondary carriers found in the biosphere.
It is ubiquitously distributed
throughout virtually all
currently recognized organismal
phyla.
This super-
family currently (2012) consists of 74 families, each of which is usually con-
cerned with the transport
of
a certain type of
substrate.
Many of
these
families, deﬁned phylogenetically, do not include even a single member that
is functionally characterized.
In this article,
we probe the evolutionary ori-
gins of these transporters,
providing evidence that they arose from a single
2-transmembrane segment
(TMS)
hairpin structure that triplicated to give
a 6-TMS unit
that
duplicated to a 12-TMS protein,
the most
frequent
topological
type of
these permeases.
We globally examine MFS protein
topologies,
focusing on exceptional
proteins that
deviate from the norm.
Nine distantly related families appear to have members with 14 TMSs in
which the extra two are usually centrally localized between the two 6-TMS
repeat
units.
They probably have arisen by intragenic duplication of
an
adjacent
hairpin.
This alternative topology probably arose multiple times
during MFS evolution. Convincing evidence for MFS permeases with fewer
than 12 TMSs
was
not
forthcoming,
leading to the
suggestion that
all
12 TMSs are required for optimal function. Some homologs appear to have
13,
14,
15 or 16 TMSs,
and the probable locations of the extra TMSs were
identiﬁed.
A few MFS permeases are fused to other functional
domains or
are fully duplicated to give 24-TMS proteins with dual
functions.
Finally,
the
MFS families
with no known function were
subjected to genomic
context analyses leading to functional predictions.
Introduction
Before 1993,
several
families of
secondary carriers of
similar topology were recognized, but there was no evi-
dence
that
these
were
related by
common descent.
Among these were a family of sugar porters including
the
mammalian glucose
facilitators,
two families
of
drug and multidrug efﬂux pumps,
a family of
meta-
bolic
uptake
porters,
a family of
organo-phosphate-
ester:inorganic phosphate antiporters and a family of
oligosaccharide porters
that
included the well-studied
lactose permease of
Escherichia coli.
In that
year,
our
bioinformatic efforts
provided the ﬁrst
evidence that
these
families
were
related,
and we
coined the
term
‘major
facilitator
superfamily’
(MFS)
[1].
It
included
uniporters, symporters and antiporters.
Five years later,
the MFS was expanded to include
12 more
families
[2]
and following another
year
of
intense
research,
it
was
expanded to a total
of
34
families
[3].
Today,
we
recognize
74 MFS families.
Each well-characterized family within this superfamily
transports
a different
set
of
related compounds
(e.g.
simple
monosaccharides,
oligosaccharides,
amino
acids,
peptides,
vitamins,
enzyme
cofactors,
drugs,

[4–7].
However,
for 17 families,
no function-
ally characterized member is known.
These are called
unknown major
facilitators
(UMFs).
No evidence of
the substrates
transported or
the directions
of
trans-
port have been postulated.
The MFS and its many recognized families are tabu-
lated
and
described
within
the
IUBMB-approved
Transporter
Classiﬁcation
Database
(TCDB;

www.tcdb.org) [8,9].

Results
2-TMS repeats in MFS transporters
Early structural and sequence similarity studies revealed
that
MFS proteins exhibit
two 6-transmembrane seg-
ment
(TMS)
repeat
units (see [1]
and references cited
therein).
It has been suggested that a 3-TMS precursor
gave rise to the 6-TMS repeat element [16,17]. However,
the evidence supporting this possibility was weak,
and
the symmetry of
the hydrophobic regions observed in
what [18] and avehas [19] plots, which is often a good
indication
of
repeat
units,
tentatively
suggested
a
2-TMS repeat unit in both of the two 6-TMS halves of
these homologs.
Novel
programs,
such as ancientrep
(see Materials and methods), and recent advances in the
tools used to look for internal repeats, have signiﬁcantly
improved our ability to identify ancient intragenic dupli-
cations. Here, we provide strong statistical evidence that
a 2-TMS precursor gave rise to MFS proteins.
Horizontal
and vertical
comparisons
of
TMS 1–2
with TMS 3–4, TMS 3–4 with TMS 5–6, TMS 7–8 with
TMS 9–10
and
TMS 9–10
with
TMS 11–12,
etc.,
yielded comparison scores of
8–10 standard devations
(SD) (Fig. 1).
When looking for 3-TMS repeats,
TMSs
1, 2 and 3 were compared with TMSs 4, 5 and 6; TMSs
1 and 2 paired most frequently with TMSs 5 and 6 (data
not shown). These results conﬁrmed the 2-TMS predic-
tion based on the comparison scores and TMS align-
ments presented in Fig. 1.
These data suggest strongly
that a 2-TMS triplication and not a 3-TMS duplication
gave rise to all MFS superfamily members.
Global topological analyses of MFS porters
The major facilitator superfamily (TC# 2.A.1)
The
predicted topologies
of
MFS porters
in TCDB
(TC# 2.A.1)
were examined using the novel
tmstats
program ([20a]; see accompanying article). None of the
428 porters examined appeared to have fewer than 12
TMSs,
and 75% were
predicted to have
12.
Many
MFS porters have been shown experimentally to have
12 TMSs per polypeptide chain,
but
some,
for exam-
ple,
members
of
the drug : H
+
antiporter-2 (DHA2)
family (TC# 2.A.1.3),
have
been shown to have
14
TMSs with the extra two TMSs sandwiched in between
the two 6-TMS repeat
units [20–22].
It
has been pre-
sumed that
all
members of
the DHA2 family have a
14-TMS topology,
whereas all
members of the related
DHA1 family (TC# 2.A.1.2)
have 12 TMSs,
but
this
has not been demonstrated.
We have conducted topological
predictions
for
the
proteins
listed
under
TC# 2.A.1
(MFS)
using
the
tmstats program.
The distribution of predicted topo-
logical
types is shown in Fig. 2A,
and the histogram is
shown in Fig. 2B.
Proteins
predicted to have one or
four
TMSs
proved to be
membrane
fusion protein
(TC# 8.A.1)
family members
that
serve
as
auxiliary
constituents of
some MFS efﬂux pumps [22,23].
They
were excluded from this study using the ‘No auxiliary
proteins’ option of tmstats.
Eight proteins were predicted to have 10 TMSs,
but
on closer inspection,
all
could be interpreted as 11- or
12-TMS proteins
except
for
one
that
proved to be
N-terminally truncated because of incomplete sequenc-
ing and erroneous initiation codon selection.
Thus,
it
seems
likely that
none of
the MFS permeases
exam-
ined has just 10 TMSs.
Thirty-ﬁve proteins were predicted to have 11 TMSs.
One was from the sugar porter family (Family 1) and
six were from the DHA1 family (Family 2).
In each of
these
cases,
the
program (based on hmmtop
[24]),
missed one small
peak of
hydrophobicity,
explaining
the prediction of
11 TMSs.
Five anion : cation sym-
porter
(TC# 2.A.1.14)
family members
and 10 of
20
organic cation transporters
(TC# 2.A.1.19)
were pre-
dicted by the program to have 11 TMSs.
In all
cases,
the hydropathy plots could be interpreted in terms of
12 TMSs with one small
peak of hydrophobicity hav-
ing been missed by hmmtop.
Interestingly,
in members
of
both of
these families,
putative TMSs 1 and 2 are
separated by large hydrophilic loops,
and hydrophobic
peak 1 is most frequently missed,
causing the program
to predict 11 TMSs.
Thus,
we could not gain convinc-
ing evidence for an MFS porter of 10 or 11 TMSs.
Three proteins in the DHA2 family were predicted
to have 12 TMSs (3.7,
3.21 and 3.28).
However in 3.7
and 3.28,
two additional
C-terminal
peaks
of
hydro-
phobicity,
not
counted by hmmtop,
were
identiﬁed.
3.21 exhibits
12 putative
TMSs
with no additional
C-terminal
peaks,
but alignment with its closest homo-
logs revealed that
TMSs 1 and 2 are lacking because

the wrong initiation codon had been selected.
Thus,
all
members
of
MFS family DHA2 appear
to have
14
TMSs.
In view of these ﬁndings,
we suggest that all
12
TMSs of all examined MFS permeases are required for
function.
Nine permeases were predicted to have 13 TMSs.
Of
these,
three were from the DHA2 family 3,
and two
were from the anion : cation symporter family 14 (14.2
and 14.12).
In the two anion : cation symporter family
proteins,
the topologies could be interpreted in terms
of 12 TMSs,
but
an extra N-terminal
TMS may exist
in
both
proteins,
accounting
for
the
13-TMS
prediction.
Of
the three DHA2 family members
pre-
dicted to have 13 TMSs, all may have 14 TMSs.
Thirty-one porters were predicted to have 14 TMSs.
Twenty-ﬁve
of
these
are
from the
DHA2
(2.A.1.3)
family,
showing that a majority of the members of this
family are predicted to exhibit
14 TMSs.
In addition,
NrtP (TC# 2.A.1.8.3) of the nitrate ⁄ nitrite porter fam-
ily exhibits 14 putative TMSs.
This protein aligns with
the 12-TMS nitrate porter of the diatom, Cylindrotheca
fusiformis
(TC# 2.A.1.8.4)
throughout
its
12-TMS
length,
but
NtrP has
a
central
insertion with two
additional
TMSs
not
present
in the
latter
protein.

Moreover, all top hits obtained with NrtP as the query
sequence in NCBI
PSI-BLAST searches
exhibited 14
putative TMSs,
with the extra two centrally located.
The same proved to be true for the sialic acid trans-
porter,
NanT of
E. coli
(TC# 2.A.1.12.1)
with
the
extra two TMSs between the two 6-TMS repeat units.
Although the lactate ⁄ pyruvate porter,
Jen1 of Saccha-
romyces cereviscae (TC# 2.A.1.12.2),
has 12 TMSs,
all
top hits obtained with NCBI-BLAST and NanT as the
query
sequence
had
14
TMSs.
AmpG of
E. coli
(TC# 2.A.1.25.2),
which transports peptidoglycan deg-
radation products (muropeptides) and penicillin, exhib-
its
14 clear
peaks
of
hydrophobicity.
Its
closest
hit
with TC-BLAST was
TC# 2.A.1.25.3 which displays
12 TMSs.
These two proteins
align well,
but
AmpG
has
two extra TMSs
in the C-terminal
position.
All
top hits to AmpG obtained in an NCBI-BLAST search
exhibited 14 peaks of hydrophobicity.
The
lysophospholipid
importer
of
E. coli
(TC# 2.A.1.42.2) was predicted to have 14 TMSs,
but
12 of these are in the transporter domain,
whereas the
additional
two putative TMSs
are in the fused acyl-
ACP synthetase
domain
[25].
This
MFS
permease
therefore
has
the
usual
12-TMS topology.
All
four
members of the vacuolar basic amino acid transporter
(TC# 2.A.1.48)
family in TCDB exhibit
an apparent
14-TMS topology,
and their
closest
TC hits
outside
the vacuolar basic amino acid transporter family were
the 14-TMS DHA2 family members.
In fact,
an NCBI
search with any one
of
these
proteins
as
the
query
yielded additional
proteins predicted to have 14 TMSs.
Family 48 includes members only with 14 TMSs,
with
extra TMSs 7 and 8 being sandwiched in between the
two 6-TMS repeat units (Table 1).

Arn3 (TC# 2.A.1.16.1), Enb1 (TC# 2.A.1.16.2), Taf1
(TC# 2.A.1.16.3) and Arn1 (TC# 2.A.1.16.4),
all
from
S. cerevisiae
within the
siderophore-iron transporter
family,
are predicted to have 15 TMSs
according to
the
what
and hmmtop
programs.
The
extra
three
TMSs may be in the centers,
between the two repeat
units (TMSs 7 and 8) as well as at the C-termini (TMS
15).
Finally,
VBA2 (TC# 2.A.1.48.2) could have 14,
or
less likely,
15 TMSs.
Sixteen TMSs were predicted for
LfrA of
Mycobacterium smegmatis
(TC# 2.A.1.3.3)
and QepA of
E. coli
(TC# 2.A.1.3.33).
It
is
possible
that
these proteins
have TMSs
in a 6 + 2 + 6 + 2
arrangement, but two adjacent putative TMSs near the
C-terminus of
each protein are fairly hydrophilic and
could be inter-TMS hydrophilic loops.
TC# 2.A.1.34.1 is a sensor kinase ⁄ MFS fusion pro-
tein from Anaeromyxobacter.
It is predicted to have 17
TMSs.
However,
the N-terminal
sensor kinase domain
exhibits ﬁve or six putative TMSs,
whereas the trans-
porter domain has 12.
TC# 2.A.1.43.2 has 18 putative
TMSs,
but
this protein is a fusion between an N-ter-
minal
12-TMS
MFS
permease
and
a
C-terminal
6-TMS YedZ domain [26].
Thus,
both of
these pro-
teins exhibit the usual 12-TMS MFS topology. Finally,
2.A.1.8.11
is
a
24-TMS
fusion
protein
(NarK1–
NarK2) with two full-length MFS carriers,
each of 12
TMSs
[27].
NarK1
is
a
NO
3
: H
+
symporter,
and
NarK2 is a NO
3
: NO
2
antiporter.
These three fusion
proteins
therefore do not
represent
exceptions
to the
12-TMS rule.
The
two transporter
domains
in this
double-sized porter exhibit negative cooperativity with
respect to NO
3
afﬁnity [27].
Other MFS families
In
addition
to
the
MFS
families
listed
under
TC# 2.A.1,
there are six that
have been shown to be
distant
members
of
the MFS.
These include families
with
TC#s
2.A.2
(GPH),
2.A.12
(AAA),
2.A.17
(POT),
2.A.48
(RFC),
2.A.60
(OAT)
and
2.A.71
(FBT).
The 88 proteins
included (those within these
families
represented in TCDB on 4 November
2011)
yielded the distribution shown in Fig. 3A as
well
as
the
histogram shown in Fig. 3B.
Only one
protein,
the
folate
carrier
of
Caenorhabditis elegans
(folt1;
TC# 2.A.48.2.2),
was predicted to have nine TMSs in
a 5 + 4 arrangement.
Examination of the hydropathy
plot revealed that peaks 1 and 7 were small.
Although
peak 1 was
not
predicted to be a TMS,
peak 7 was.
Alignment of the protein sequence with all
of its close
orthologs
showed that
folt1 is
shorter
than the rest,
containing
an
internal
deletion
corresponding
to
TMSs
9
and 10
in the
12-TMS
homologs.
Thus,
assuming that
a sequencing error was responsible for
this unique deletion,
the native folt1 protein probably
has 12 TMSs.
The possibility that
this protein is the
translated
product
of
a
pseudogene
cannot
be
excluded.
Most
of
the proteins predicted to possess 10 or 11
TMSs
could be interpreted in terms
of
the expected
12-TMS
topology.
Thus,
peaks
of
hydrophobicity,
revealed by the what program,
were not predicted to
be TMSs by the hmmtop program.
Because these pro-
teins
proved
to
be
homologous
throughout
their
lengths with close homologs that appear to possess 12
TMSs,
we conclude that
these proteins
also have 12
TMSs.

88 homologs
were
predicted to
have
12
TMSs.
Interestingly,
every
member
of
the
AAA family (2.A.12) was predicted to have 12 TMSs.
Six and seven homologs of these six families were pre-
dicted to have
13 and 14 TMSs,
respectively.
After
examining these
proteins
in greater
detail,
we
con-
cluded that some of
these 13 proteins have 12 TMSs,
but most have 14.
In every case where 14 TMSs were
predicted,
the extra two were present in the middle of
these proteins,
between the two 6-TMS repeat
units.
Among the proteins with 14 clear peaks of hydropho-
bicity (14 probable TMSs) were 2.A.2.6.2,
2.A.17.1.1-4
and 2.A.71.1.1-4.
We conclude that in the GPH,
POT
and FBT families,
both the 12- and 14-TMS homologs
exist,
and in general,
these segregate according to TC
subfamily.
It should be noted that several
MFS fami-
lies
tabulated under
TC# 2.A.1 also have 14 TMSs,
sometimes exclusively,
but
frequently among 12-TMS
homologs.
These
results
conﬁrm the
conclusion that
the 14-TMS topology evolved from the 12-TMS topol-
ogy many times in different families.
Variations in 14-TMS topologies
Several
MFS
(2.A.1)
homologs
have
a
modiﬁed
12-TMS topology with between one
and four
extra
TMSs
predicted.
2.A.1.14.2
has
an extra
predicted
N-terminal
TMS in an arrangement:
1 + 6 + 6.
The
same
is
true
for
2.A.1.40.1-3.
These
three
proteins
probably have 13 TMSs,
in which TMS 1 is
distant
from TMS 2 (the ﬁrst TMS in the ﬁrst 6-TMS half).
Few proteins were predicted to have 15 or 16 TMSs.
All
members
of
family 16
(siderophore-iron
trans-
porter) were predicted to have 15 TMSs.
However,
the
penultimate putative TMS was only weakly hydropho-
bic,
although being more strongly amphipathic.
Direct
experimental evidence will be required to determine the
topologies of these C-terminal domains.
In summary,
MFS permeases
are remarkably con-
stant
in topology,
having
12
TMSs
with high fre-
quency,
14 TMSs with lower frequencies,
and 13,
15
or 16 TMSs with very low frequencies (Table 1). When
13 or 15 TMSs are predicted,
the extra one is likely to
be N-terminal
or
more frequently,
C-terminal
to the
standard 12-
or
14-TMS topological
arrangements,
respectively.
Very few homologs may have 16 TMSs in
a 6 + 2 + 6 + 2 arrangement (see Table 1).
Functional predictions for MFS families of
unknown specificities
Small
gene size,
high gene density,
intronless
coding
regions
and simple
operon organization in bacterial
genomes render functional
predictions feasible [28,29].
Our
previous
molecular
genetics
studies
based
on
operon context have proven to be successful
in identi-
fying the substrates of
transporters of
unknown func-
tion [25,26,30,31].
Further,
D.A.
Rodionov and his
coworkers have demonstrated the success of these pre-
dictions using the same databases and procedures (see
[32–34]
as
well
as
earlier
publications
from this
research group).
Operon context analyses and identiﬁ-
cation of transcription factor-controlled regulons were
facilitated by the use of the SEED database [35]
along
with RegPrecise and RegPredict
[36,37].
SEED identi-
ﬁes
close homologs
using the PSI-BLAST algorithm
[38,39].
Sixteen families
listed under
TC# 2.A.1 include no
member
with known substrate(s).
These
are
called
UMF families (UMF1–16).
The former UMF1 family
(2.A.1.24)
now includes a member of
known function
and therefore was excluded from these studies.
Below
we use the SEED and RegPredict databases as well
as
relationships
with other
families
in TCDB to predict
functions.
UMF2 (2.A.1.26)
The UMF2 protein of E. coli,
ycaD with 12 TMSs,
is
found adjacent to the ycaM gene,
coding for a protein
with 13 putative TMSs,
a member of the APC super-
family.
All
functionally characterized members of
the
APC family (2.A.3)
within the APC superfamily [39a]
are known to take up amino acids, polyamines and or-
ganocations.
Adjacent
to and divergently transcribed
in many organisms,
we ﬁnd an operon encoding pyru-
vate-formate lyase and its activator, as well as a proba-
ble
formate
efﬂux
system.
In
other
coregulated
operons,
the
enzyme,
acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
which
catalyzes the formation of
the precursor of
fatty acid
biosynthesis,
malonyl-CoA,
can
be
found.
These
results
indicate that
the transporter,
YcaD,
functions
in a capacity related to the
synthesis,
utilization or
degradation of acetyl-CoA.
Preliminary results indicate
that it is a pyruvate ⁄ a-ketobutyrate uptake system (AJ
Le et al., unpublished results).
A
palindromic
DNA
sequence,
CCATGAAA
TTTTTCGACTGAA,
was
identiﬁed in front
of
the
ycaDM operon in various
enterobacterial
genomes.
This sequence was identiﬁed in front
of
six such ope-
rons
within the RegPredict
training set.
This
reveals
that
the
protein binding to this
site
is
restricted in
scope and probably regulates a speciﬁc branch of
the
metabolome.
It was by this method that we were able
to identify
the
acetyl-CoA carboxylase
gene
which
apparently is co-regulated with the ycaDM operon.

UMF3 (2.A.1.29)
Only two UMF3 family members proved to be sufﬁ-
ciently similar in sequence to warrant
being included
within the same SEED subsystem. In the gene neighbor-
hood of the Aeropyrum pernix homolog,
a gene cluster
encodes
a
complete
ABC peptide
uptake
system
(TC# 3.A.1.5)
with all
ﬁve expected constituents.
The
presence of a peptide uptake system as well
as a gluta-
mate decarboxylase within the same operon with each
of
the two archaeal
UMF3 family members
suggests
that the MFS transporter could be an exporter for an
amino acid or amino acid derivative such as the product
of the a-decarboxylation reaction, c-aminobutyric acid.
UMF4 (2.A.1.33)
YqgE of Bacillus subtilis is encoded in an operon also
encoding the essential cell division protein, FtsI, a pep-
tidoglycan synthetase (EC# 2.4.1.129)
that
exhibits
a
penicillin
binding
protein
(PBP3)
transpeptidase
domain. This enzyme is a member of the DD peptidase
family which includes
transpeptidases,
carboxypeptid-
ases
and endopeptidases.
The byproduct
of
the FtsI
transpeptidase reaction (cross-linking extracytoplasmic
peptidoglycan cell
wall
strands)
is d-alanine.
Possibly
YqgE is a d-alanine uptake porter. In some organisms,
YqgE homologs
are encoded in operons
with a Pst
phosphate
transporter
of
the
ABC
superfamily
(TC# 3.A.1.7.1);
other times,
these genes are not coex-
pressed but are in the same gene neighborhood.
UMF5 (2.A.1.46)
Examining the gene neighborhoods of the two UMF5
representatives in TCDB from Bordetella pertussis and
Tropheryma whipplei
did not reveal
extensive gene con-
servation and thus,
no functional
predictions
were
made.
UMF6 (2.A.1.47)
Streptococcus pneumoniae
and
Streptococcus thermo-
philus
each encodes
a UMF6 family member
that
is
present in an operon with two lantibiotic peptide bio-
synthetic
enzymes.
It
seems
likely that
these
trans-
porters export
the bacteriocidal
peptides produced by
these
biosynthetic
enzymes.
All
such UMF6 homo-
logs appear to derive from Firmicutes and Molecutes
which are known to produce bacteriocins.
However,
several
UMF6 homologs may export other substrates,
such
as
other
peptides
with
differing
modes
of
action.
UMF7 (2.A.1.51)
UMF7 homologs are found in many bacteria. In the a-pro-
teobacterial genuses, Brucella, Rhizobium and Agrobacte-
rium,
they colocalize with:
(a)
a LysR transcriptional
regulator,mostofwhichfunctionintheregulationofamino
acid ⁄ nitrogen metabolism; (b) a BacA peptide ⁄ bleomycin
uptake transporter of Rhizobium meliloti;
(c) a putative
polysaccharidedeacetylase;and(d)anEngA-typeGTPase.
The BacA protein (TC# 9.A.18.1.2) is homologous to the
microcin peptide
uptake permease,
SbmA (TC# 9.A.
18.1.1). On this basis, we suggest that UMF7 may function
in some aspect of amino acid metabolism, possibly catalyz-
ing the efﬂuxof peptidehydrolysis products: aminoacidsor
aminoacidderivatives.
UMF8 (2.A.1.52)
Eight
UMF8
homologs
were
examined
in
enteric
bacteria.
In E. coli
and its close relatives,
UMF8 was
in the same operon with a transcriptional
regulator of
the
GntR family as
well
as
a probable
l-xylulose-
5-phosphate-3-epimerase.
In
other
bacteria
such
as
Proteus mirabilis
and
Yersinia pestis
the
transporter
again appeared to be
in operons
that
also encoded
either a hexulose-6-phosphate isomerase or an l-xylu-
lose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase.
An
E. coli
operon
convergently
transcribed from the
one
bearing
the
UMF8
homolog
encodes
two
putative
glucuronide
transporters
(TC# 2.A.2.3)
and an a-glucosidase,
as
well
as
a
putative
outer
membrane
sugar
porin
(TC# 1.B.21.2.1).
All
of
these
results
indicate
that
UMF8 is
a transporter
for
one or
more sugars
that
feed into the pentose-phosphate pathway.
Candidates
include gluconate,
glucuronate,
galactonate,
galacturo-
nate and certain pentoses.
UMF9 (2.A.1.54)
The archaeal UMF9 protein in TCDB, present in Met-
hanococcus maripaludis,
is
encoded in a gene
cluster
that also encodes several
enzymes that probably func-
tion
in
methanogenesis.
Immediately
adjacent
to
UMF9 is a possible uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase,
an enzyme
involved in heme
biosynthesis,
but
this
enzyme
is
homologous
to
methyl-cobalamin : coen-
zyme M methyltransferase,
an
enzyme
involved
in
methane
production
from methanol,
dimethylamine
and
trimethylamine.
Convergently
transcribed
from
this
two-gene
operon
is
a
four-gene
operon
that
encodes
a
dimethylamine
methyltransferase
corrinoid
protein,
two proteins
similar
in sequence
to methyl-
cobalamin : coenzyme M methyltransferase and a large

(593 amino acids)
protein with a ferredoxin domain,
probably
involved in electron transfer.
Thus,
UMF9
could be an uptake system for substrates of methanogen-
esis such as di- and trimethylamine as well as methanol.
UMF10 (2.A.1.59)
UMF10
proteins
are
found
in
both
bacteria
and
archaea.
The archaeal
homologs occur in poorly con-
served operons with few clues as to the potential trans-
port
substrates.
The bacterial
proteins often occur in
different
types of gene clusters with potential
implica-
tions
as
to function.
For
example,
in Nostoc puncti-
forme,
Chlorobium tepidum and Chlorobaculum parvum,
the
UMF10
homologs
occur
together
with 8-TMS
rhomboid intramembrane proteases that probably cat-
alyze
protein hydrolysis.
They may also function in
bacterial
transmembrane
protein
translocation
[40].
Sensor
histidine
kinase ⁄ response
regulator
pairs
are
also encoded.
The sensor kinases are in the same fam-
ily with QseC, a bacterial adrenergic receptor that acti-
vates
virulence
gene
expression
in
response
to
interkingdom cross-signaling [41].
This sensor kinase ⁄
response regulator pair also regulates the master switch
of the bacterial ﬂagellum, ﬂhDC [42].
UMF11 (2.A.1.62)
UMF11 proteins,
sometimes
annotated as
macrolide
efﬂux
systems
in the
NCBI
protein databank,
are
found
in
many
Firmicutes
of
the
genera
Bacillus,
Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus.
They occur in gene
clusters,
often within operons,
that
include an azore-
ductase,
responsible for the oxidation of
diamines
to
azo compounds
(R-N=N-R¢),
and homologs
of
the
periplasmic YdcF S-adenosyl
methionine binding pro-
tein that in some organisms plays a role in vancomycin
resistance [43].
Because vancomycin contains multiple
amino groups,
it is possible that the UMF11 homolog
and the azoreductase play a role in vancomycin resis-
tance.
In several
Firmicutes,
these genes may be under
the control
of a LysR transcriptional
regulator,
and in
some
of
them,
putative glycine ⁄ betaine
ABC uptake
systems,
arginine ⁄ ornithine
antiporters
and aspartate
ammonia-lyases can also be found. Thus, because these
gene clusters are concerned with nitrogen metabolism,
bacterial
UMF11 homologs are likely to play a role in
the transport of amino acids or their derivatives.
UMF12 (2.A.1.63)
In several
archaea
and bacteria
(e.g.
Methanosarci-
na mazei and Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus) the
UMF12 homologs are present within operons that also
encode the ﬁve constituents of
a complete ABC pep-
tide uptake porter of
the PepT family (TC# 3.A.1.5).
TC-BLAST searches
revealed that
these proteins
are
probably
peptide
rather
than oligosaccharide
trans-
porters,
both of which can be found in the PepT fam-
ily.
Possibly these UMF12 transporters export
amino
acids and ⁄ or their derivatives.
In other archaea,
including several
Pyrococcus spe-
cies,
the UMF12 homologs
are encoded within gene
clusters
that
are involved in amino acid metabolism.
Enzymes
encoded include indolepyruvate oxidoreduc-
tase,
concerned with aromatic amino acid interconver-
sions,
asparaginase
(isoaspartyl
aminopeptidase),
which cleaves
asparagine to aspartate and ammonia,
and another MFS permease most similar to the efﬂux
pumps
of
the
Dha1
family
(TC# 2.A.1.2).
These
observations
suggest
that
like
UMF11
proteins,
UMF12 homologs
are
involved in the
transport
of
amino acids.
Finally,
in Deinococcus species,
UMF12
homologs
are
sandwiched in between endonucleases
(Family
III)
and
putative
zinc-ribbon
nucleic
acid
binding
proteins.
Possibly
these
Deinococcal
trans-
porters
are involved in nucleotide or
oligonucleotide
transport.
UMF13 (2.A.1.64)
Members
of
the
UMF13 family are
found only in
Streptococci.
They are
encoded within operons
that
also encodes
radical
S-adenosyl
methionine
(SAM)
domain proteins,
which create
free
radicals
in reac-
tions
dependent
on 4Fe–4S centers
and S-adenosyl
methionine.
Arginase ⁄ agmatinase,
which removes
the
guanadinium group from both of these compounds,
is
also encoded. Upstream of this operon and transcribed
in the same direction are a MutR transcription factor
and a lysine N-methylase.
However,
a space between
the
lysine
N-methylase
gene
and the
radical
SAM
domain gene is
large enough ( 200 bp)
to indicate
independent
transcription.
Similarly,
downstream of
the UMF13-encoding operon is a two-cistron operon
that encodes acetolactate synthase and alpha-acetolac-
tate decarboxylase,
involved in acetoin and butanediol
production.
The
coexpression of
UMF13
homologs
with arginase
and agmatinase
suggests
that
UMF13
could be an uptake porter for arginine and ⁄ or agma-
tine.
UMF14 (2.A.1.65)
UMF14 proteins are found only in animals and were
not investigated further.

UMF15 (2.A.1.66)
Archaeal
UMF15 homologs appear to function in the
uptake of
a-
and b-galactosides.
In some organisms
(Thermosipho,
Pyrococcus and Thermococcus),
the ope-
rons encoding UMF15 homologs also encode a puta-
tive
a-galactosidase
and
galactokinase.
The
b-galactosidase gene is
convergently transcribed,
and
divergently
transcribed
from
this
monocistronic
operon,
is a gene encoding galactose-1-phosphate uri-
dylyl
transferase.
In other
archaea (Staphylothermus
and Halothermathrix),
the
transporter
gene
and the
b-galactosidase gene are either
cotranscribed or
con-
vergently transcribed.
In one case (Thermoﬁlum),
these
two genes
are cotranscribed and the galactose meta-
bolic genes occur in different operons in the same gene
cluster.
There is
little doubt
that
these UMF15 pro-
teins transport galactosides. In many organisms includ-
ing
E. coli,
the
galactose
regulon
includes
several
operons that are not colocalized on the bacterial
chro-
mosome.
Also within the UMF15 family (TC# 2.A.1.66.2) is a
gene from Leptospira interrogans
encoding a putative
4-hydroxybenzoate
uptake
porter,
MFS_1.
Its
gene
occurs
in an operon that
also encodes
2,3-diketo-5-
methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate
enolase-phosphatase
of
the
methionine
salvage
pathway.
This
enzyme
uses
SAM as a substrate.
It is possible that this transporter
catalyzes the uptake of SAM. In Comamonas sp. strain
E6, a homolog, Pmd, may be a protocatechuate uptake
porter
[44].
The
UMF15
family
is
also
found
in
eukaryotes,
e.g.
in the
Stromenophile,
Thalassiosira
pseudonana.
UMF16 (2.A.1.67)
UMF16 is found in a variety of actinobacteria includ-
ing species
of
Streptomyces
and Mycobacterium.
In
several
of
these
organisms,
the
gene
encoding
the
UMF16 homolog is present in what appears to be an
operon where the downstream gene is an FAD-bind-
ing-4
superfamily
oxidase.
These
enzymes
include
sugar-1,4-lactone
oxidases,
one
of
which is
d-araba-
nose-1,4-lactone oxidase,
the enzyme that catalyzes the
ﬁnal
step in the biosynthesis of d-erythroascorbate,
an
antioxidant made by fungi
and actinobacteria.
Homol-
ogous to d-arabinose-1,4-lactone oxidase is l-gulono-
lactone
oxidase
which
converts
l-gulonolactone
to
l-xylo-hex-2-ulono-1,4-lactone,
the
precursor
of
ascorbate
[45].
Among the
actinobacteria that
have
this
gene
arrangement
are
Catenulispora acidiphila,
Streptomyces griseus,
Streptomyces coelicolor,
Therm-
obispora bispora,
Streptosporangium roseum
and
Thermomonospora curvata.
These
proteins
probably
function in a single pathway. Because the oxidase cata-
lyzes
the ﬁnal
step in l-ascorbate or
d-erythroascor-
bate
biosynthesis,
we
propose
that
UMF16
is
an
l-ascorbate
and ⁄ or
d-erythroascorbate
exporter,
although it
may have an uptake function for
one of
the
several
potential
precursors
of
erythroascorbate
and ⁄ or
ascorbate
biosynthesis
including d-arabinose,
d-ribose, l-galactose, l-gulose or myo-inositol [46].
Homology between MFS and APC superfamily
members
Surprisingly,
all
three proteins under 2.A.1.40 showed
excellent
scores (as low as e
)10
)
with members of
the
NCS2 (2.A.40)
family.
NCS2 proteins,
like
2.A.1.40
proteins,
exhibit
13 putative TMSs
as
the most
fre-
quent topology. Twelve and 14 TMSs are predicted for
some
homologs.
However,
2.A.40
family
members
brought
up 2.A.53 (SulP)
family member with scores
as low as 10
)10
.
A representative is provided in Fig. 4.
In both proteins (2.A.1.40.1;
AzgA of Aspergillus nidu-
lans versus 2.A.53.3.4,
a SulP homolog of
Chloroﬂex-
us auranticus),
a
comparison
score
of
16
SD was
obtained using the gsat program.
Many other
high
scoring pairs were also observed.
Both the NCS2 and
SulP families
are
in the
APC superfamily,
strongly
implying that
the
MFS and APC superfamilies
are
related.
SulP family members,
like
NCS2 and some
MFS permeases exhibited up to 14 peaks of hydropho-
bicity
in an apparent
6 + 2 + 6
arrangement
(see
Table 1).
Discussion
In this
article,
we describe the current
status
of
the
MFS and present
new bioinformatic research results
that
demonstrate
that
the
probable
origin
of
the
6-TMS repeat
unit
in these proteins involved triplica-
tion of
a 2-TMS hairpin structure.
The standard and
most prevalent topology for MFS porters is 12 TMSs,
but
we
found that
several
families
include
members
with 14 TMSs,
an established topology for
QacA of
Staphylococcus aureus,
a member of the DHA2 family
(TC# 2.A.1.3)
[23].
In most
such cases,
and probably
in all
DHA2 family members,
the
extra two TMSs
separate the two 6-TMS repeat units.
These two extra
TMSs
appear
to be
homologous
to the
primordial
2-TMS element
that
we believe was the precursor of
all MFS permeases, and it may have arisen by duplica-
tion of
the adjacent
hairpin structure.
We tentatively
suggest that TMSs 5 and 6 duplicated to give 7 and 8,
based on sequence similarities.

Because
some
MFS families
have
both 12-
and
14-TMS members,
and because the evolutionary dis-
tances
between the
different
families
are substantial,
we propose that the 14-TMS topology has arisen from
the
12-TMS precursors
several
times
independently
(see Table 1).
In addition,
genetically engineered loss
of
the
central
two TMSs
in a 14-TMS drug efﬂux
pump changed its
speciﬁcity,
but
was
still
functional
for cation (but not drug) transport [20,47].
Because an
equivalent
internal
partial
duplication is rare in other
transport
protein families,
speciﬁc
genetic
conditions
or
selective
pressures
must
be
responsible
for
this
recurrent
event.
It
will
be interesting to know what
these conditions and pressures were.
Topological
analyses
revealed the
surprising topo-
logical
inﬂexibility of the MFS.
We could not conﬁrm
the presence of
a single member
with fewer
than 12
TMSs,
although the results do not exclude such a pos-
sibility.
Nor do we have examples of
‘split’
proteins,
where two or more polypeptide chains comprise a sin-
gle permease.
This is surprising in view of the fact that
one can experimentally split
MFS permeases
without
loss
of
activity [48,49].
Perhaps
the intact
permeases,
included within a single
polypeptide
chain,
facilitate
both
substrate
recognition
and
the
conformational
changes
that
comprise
the
transport
catalytic
cycle
[50,51].
Split porters may have diminished activity and
therefore would have been selected against during evo-
lutionary time.
When topological
variation within the
MFS did
occur,
the extra TMSs,
in addition to the two central
TMSs in most
14-TMS proteins,
were either N-termi-
nal
or
C-terminal
(Table 1).
The
latter
option
occurred more frequently,
and the presence of a single
N-terminal
putative
TMS
was
exceptionally
rare.
Never
did we
ﬁnd more
than one
extra N-terminal
TMS.
However,
extra C-terminal
TMSs,
although also
rare,
occurred with higher
frequency,
and either
one
or two putative TMSs were identiﬁed.
A few cases of
gene fusion were noted.
In one case,
a 6-TMS YedZ
cytochrome b
domain
was
fused
C-terminal
to
an
MFS carrier.
This protein is present in a magnetotac-
tic bacterium,
where the transporter might
be a mag-
netosome iron uptake porter.
Then the YedZ domain
could reduce part of the Fe
3+
to Fe
2+
in preparation
for
the
production
of
magnetic
magnetite
crystals
[26,52,53].
Another fusion involved a lysophospholipid
uptake permease (12 TMSs)
fused to an acyltransfer-
ase ⁄ acyl-ACP synthetase (2 TMSs)
[25].
A well
stud-
ied two permease fusion has been characterized where
one
porter
catalyzes
nitrate
uptake
while
the
other
catalyzes
nitrate ⁄ nitrite
exchange.
One
can imagine
that
the
former
is
most
useful
in initiating
nitrate
uptake,
whereas the latter is functional
after intracel-
lular
nitrite
builds
up in the
cytoplasm.
The
two
permeases are known to exhibit negative cooperativity
[27,54].
This may favor one over the other,
depending
on substrate availability.
The functional
predictions
presented in this
report
provide the very ﬁrst evidence for the substrate speciﬁci-
ties of members of the UMFs for which no member of
the
family has
been characterized.

predictions

could be made with various levels of
conﬁdence.
For
example,
galactoside uptake permeases (UMF15) were
predicted with high conﬁdence.
Others were predicted
to take up pyruvate (UMF2),
d-alanine (UMF4),
one
or
more
sugar
substrates
of
the
pentose-phosphate
pathway (i.e. sugar acids or pentoses) [55] (UMF8) and
archaeal
substrates
for
methanogenesis
(di ⁄ trimethyl-
amine
and methanol;
UMF9).
Members
of
several
UMF families may export
amino acids or their meta-
bolic
products
(UMF3,
UMF7,
UMF10,
UMF11,
UMF12
and
UMF13)
or
bacteriocidal
peptides
(UMF6;
see Table 2).
One of these (UMF11) may also
export
drugs
such
as
vancomycin,
and
another
(UMF12)
may also include
members
that
transport
nucleotides.
Like the UMF8 family,
members
of
the
UMF16 family may take up a precursor of ascorbate or
one of its related antioxidants or export end products
of ascorbate ⁄ erythroascorbate biosynthesis (Table 2).
Materials and methods
Identification of internal repeats
The
ancientrep
(ar)
program ([20a];
see
accompanying
paper) was used to identify internal
repeats.
AR offers two
techniques for ﬁnding repeat
units:
‘horizontal
and ‘verti-
cal’.
Horizontal
searches look for internal
repeats within a
single protein,
whereas vertical
searches locate TMS repeat
units across a list
of
homologs.
All
comparisons are per-
formed using gsat ⁄ gap ([20a];
see accompanying paper),
and scores
are given in SD.
The best
comparison scores
were manually conﬁrmed and analyzed further
using the
gsat ⁄ gap
program [56].
The
gsat program was
derived
from the GAP algorithm ([20a];
see accompanying paper).
The gsat ⁄ gap program was set
at
default
settings with a
gap creation penalty of 8 and a gap extension penalty of 2
with 500 random shufﬂes.
A length of 60 amino acyl
resi-
dues,
the average size of a typical
protein domain,
and 10
SD,
corresponding to a probability of
10
)24
that
the level
of
similarity arose
by chance,
is
considered sufﬁcient
to
establish
homology,
resulting
from divergent
evolution
between two proteins
or
internal
repeat
units
[9,57–59].
Optimization of the GSAT ⁄ GAP alignment was performed
on sequences by maximizing the number of identities,
mini-
mizing gaps
and removing non-aligned sequences
at
the
ends. Optimization usually yields a higher comparison score
that
better
represents
the level
of
similarity between two
shorter
internal
sequences.
Horizontal
comparisons
are
more convincing when several
good scores are obtained (5
SDs and up,
60 or more residues in length and under 15%
gaps.).
Vertical
searching is useful
when horizontal
scores
are insufﬁcient. Good vertical results will reveal repeat units
that
are poorly conserved within a single protein,
but
are
more easily recognized in one or more of its homologs. The
vertical
approach is
valid only if
homology is
established
between the pair in question by virtue of
the superfamily
principle [60].
The reliability of these quantitative methods
have been discussed and compared with other approaches
by Matias
et al.
[61]
and Wang et al.
[62].
The basis
for
concluding that
the observed degrees of
sequence similari-
ties necessary to give 10 SD for a stretch of
> 60 amino
acids are due to divergent rather than convergent evolution
has been considered [9,59].

Topological analyses
For
topological
analyses
of
single
protein sequences,
the
what and hmmtop programs were used [18,24,63].
Statisti-
cal
analyses,
based on predictions made by the what and
hmmtop programs,
were performed using the tmstats pro-
gram ([20a];
see accompanying paper).
The tmstats histo-
gram represents the probability of ﬁnding a protein with a
particular number of
TMSs within the selected TC hierar-
chy.
These probabilities
are extrapolated by generating a
microcosmic
representation of
the
user’s
actual
selection,
and consist
of
100 000 computer-generated proteins.
TMS
predictions
are performed using hmmtop [24,63].
Next
to
the histogram is a bar graph that illustrates the actual
dis-
tribution of TMSs as found in the selected proteins derived
from TCDB.
A TMS average is displayed alongside these
graphs,
accompanied by a score
in SD to represent
the
TMS distribution in the
selected TC systems.
The
ﬁnal
items in the report
are tabulated data containing a list
of
TCIDs sorted by their corresponding TMS count.
Clicking
on the corresponding member brings the user to the entry
in TCDB for further analysis.
Functional analyses
To
propose
possible
related
functions,
genome
context
analyses
were performed using The SEED-Viewer,
which
allows
the
exploration of
over
1500 curated genomes
in
order to ﬁnd homologous genes,
their operon context,
and
consequently their known or putative roles in other organ-
isms [35].
This was done alongside RegPrecise and RegPre-
dict,
which allow for
the
identiﬁcation of
transcription
factor-controlled regulons [36,37].
