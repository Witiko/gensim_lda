Abstract.
In this article, we quantitatively analyze how the term “fake
news” is being shaped in news media in recent years. We study the per-
ception and the conceptualization of this term in the traditional
media
using eight years of data collected from news outlets based in 20 coun-
tries.
Our results not only corroborate previous indications of
a high
increase in the usage of the expression “fake news”, but also show contex-
tual changes around this expression after the United States presidential
election of 2016.
Among other results,
we found changes in the related
vocabulary,
in the mentioned entities,
in the surrounding topics and in
the contextual
polarity around the term “fake news”,
suggesting that
this expression underwent a change in perception and conceptualization
after 2016.
These outcomes expand the understandings on the usage of
the term “fake news”, helping to comprehend and more accurately char-
acterize this relevant social
phenomenon linked to misinformation and
manipulation.

Introduction
The term “fake news”, defined as “false, often sensational, information dissem-
inated under the guise of news reporting” [6], gained so much attention that it
was named the Collins Word of the Year 2017 due to its unprecedented usage
increase of
365% in the Collins Corpus [6].
Even though the concept of
news
articles aimed to mislead readers is by no means new [24],
it seems to exist a
relationship between the very expression “fake news” with the 2016 presidential
election in the United States of America: Davies [8], using data from the NOW
Corpus, shows that “there is almost no mention of ‘fake news’ until the first week
of November [2016] (...) and then it explodes in Nov 11-20, and has stayed very
high since then”. The author adds that the reason “why people all of the sudden

E. Cunha et al.
started talking about something that had really not been mentioned much at all
until that time” was “the US elections, which were held on November 9, 2016”.
The sudden popularization of an already existing term (that is, not a neolo-
gism) in a language poses interesting questions regarding how concepts around
this term are perceived by the speakers of
that language.
We might ask,
for
instance:
what changed (if
anything) in terms of
conceptualization of
this ex-
pression after its boom? Was there any kind of
shift in the meaning of
this
expression when it became widely employed? If so, was this shift uniform across
different varieties of
the language? These are some of
the issues of
interest in
lexicology,
the area of
linguistics focused in the study of
the lexicon,
that has
been fostered thanks to advances in corpus linguistics,
concerned with the use
of big real-world corpora to the study of language.
The goal
of
this article is to provide a closer look at how newspapers and
magazines across the world shape the term “fake news” – which is a relevant
social
phenomenon linked to misinformation and manipulation,
and that has
been facilitated by the rise of
the Internet and online social
media in recent
years. We investigate the perception and the conceptualization of this expression
through the quantitative analysis of
a large corpus of
news published in 20
countries from 2010 to 2018,
thus making it possible to examine not only the
diachronic development of this term,
but also its synchronic usage in different
parts of the English-speaking world. We complement our investigation with data
collected from online search queries that help to measure how the public interest
in the expression “fake news” and in the concepts around it changed over time
in different places.
1.1
Related work
In 2010,
Michel
et al.
[17]
coined the term culturomics meaning a method to
study human behavior, cultural trends and language change through the quan-
titative diachronic analysis of texts, including of digitized books provided by the
project Google Books. Several studies explore this method to investigate topics
such as the dynamics of
birth and death of
words [20],
semantic change [12],
emotions in literary texts [1] and general characteristics of modern societies [22].
However, many criticisms arose regarding limitations of inferences derived from
the analysis of
Google Books due to factors that range from optical
character
recognition errors and overabundance of scientific literature [19]
to the lack of
metadata in the corpus [13].
Leetaru [15] proposes a somewhat complementary approach that he calls cul-
turomics 2.0, which uses historical news data instead of books and can, accord-
ing to the author,
“yield intriguing new understandings of human society”.
In
the same vein,
Flaounas et al.
analyze the European mediasphere [11]
and the
writing style,
gender bias and the popularity of
particular topics [10]
in large
corpora of news articles. Landsall-Welfare et al. [14], also using a large dataset
of
media reports,
observe a change of
framing and sentiment associated with
nuclear power after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
They detected effects on

attention,
sentiment,
conceptual
associations and in the network of actors and
actions linked to nuclear power following the accident.
In this investigation,
we combine many of the methods employed in the re-
lated works mentioned above.
However,
as far as we are concerned,
this is the
first paper that uses these methods to examine in details how the relevant term
“fake news” is being reported by news media in different parts of the world and
in two distinct periods in the history of this expression.
1.2
Research question
Our main research question is:
was the rise of
the public interest
in the term
“fake news” accompanied by changes in its conceptualization and in the percep-
tion about it? Based on sociolexicological theories, that defend the existence of
a considerable relationship between linguistic and extralinguistic factors with
regards to the vocabulary of a language [16,5], our hypothesis is that the change
of interest in the phenomenon fake news might have altered the general usage of
the expression referring to it. Indeed, the results obtained in our investigations
indicate,
in general,
a positive answer for our research question.
Among other
findings, we show modifications in the related vocabulary and in the mentioned
entities accompanying the term “fake news”, in addition to changes in the topics
associated to this concept and in the overall contextual polarity of the pieces of
text around this expression in media articles after 2016.
This article is structured as follows: in the next section, we present the process
of acquisition and preparation of the main data source used in our investigations;
in Section 3, we describe our analyses, present the found results and discuss their
implications; finally, in Section 4, we summarize the outcomes of our study and
conclude this paper by discussing possible future outlooks.

Data source
The main dataset used in this study comes from the Corpus of News on the Web
(NOW Corpus), which contains articles from online newspapers and magazines
written in English and based in 20 different countries from 2010 to the present
time [7]. This corpus is available for download and online exploration at https:
//corpus.byu.edu/now/ and,
according to its authors,
“is [as of April
2018]
by
far the largest corpus (of
any language) that is available in full-text format”.
Our analyses are relative to a version of
the corpus available in the month of
April 2018, containing around six billion words of data.
In this dataset, we searched for all the occurrences of the term “fake news”.
For each occurrence,
the online version of
the corpus provides a concordance
line,
or context
– that is,
a piece of text of approximately 20-30 words around
(before and after) the searched term.
For example,
for a certain news article
published in July 25 2017 in the Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation,
the context
around the term “fake news” is:
(...) of
social
media and a study that said 90
4
E. Cunha et al.
per cent of Kenyans had encountered fake news. WhatsApp and Facebook are
the two leading sources of misinformation, often (...).
All
of our analyses were
performed in these contexts,
since words immediately surrounding a key term
are more relevant to the conceptualization of this term than words further away
from it, though in the same text. Wynne [27] adds that the main reason for using
keywords in context (KWICs) in corpus linguistics is that “interesting insights
into the structure and usage of a language can be obtained by looking at words
in real texts and seeing what patterns of lexis, grammar and meaning surround
them”.
The total
number of
occurrences of
“fake news” extracted from the NOW
Corpus in April
30 2018 is 41,124.
These occurrences encompass news articles
published in all
the 20 countries represented in the corpus,
that were grouped
in six regions based on their geographical locations (Africa, British Isles, Indian
subcontinent,
Oceania,
Southeast Asia and The Americas),
since it has been
observed that offline and online news outlets tend to give preference to local and
national news, to domesticate news about other countries and to reflect imbal-
anced information flows between the developed and the developing worlds [2].
These occurrences also cover each year in the corpus (from 2010 to 2018).
Due to the previously observed increase in the usage of
the term “fake news”
during and after the 2016 presidential election in the United States of America
(mentioned in Section 1), we categorized the occurrences in two periods: before
and after the 2016 US election. The election was held in November, but we set
the delimitation date between these periods in the end of the first semester of
2016 (June 30) in order to include the political campaign in the period after US
election. Table 1 shows the number of contexts containing the term “fake news”
in our dataset according to the geographical
origin of
the corresponding news
media and the year and period of publication of the news article.

Analyses and results
In this section, we display and examine the outcomes of our investigations. Each
analysis is introduced by a description of how it is able to contribute answering
to our research question, followed by the methodology employed and finally by
a presentation and discussion of the results found.

Web search behavior
Before analyzing the data obtained from the NOW Corpus,
we investigate
whether it is possible to observe a change in Web search behavior regarding the
expression “fake news” corresponding to the high increase in its use during and
after the 2016 presidential
election in the United States of America mentioned
in Section 1.

engine, displays that public interest in the term “fake news” was approximately
constant from 2010 until
2016,
when it greatly and suddenly increased,
as in-
dicated by Figure 1.
This data also shows that,
in the period before the 2016
US presidential elections, most of the countries with the highest proportions of
searches for the term “fake news” were from the Eastern world.
However,
af-
ter the US election,
the proportion of
searches for this expression in Western
countries increased considerably,
especially in Europe.
The 10 countries with
the highest proportion of searches for the term “fake news” in both periods are
listed in Table 2.
A closer look at the data from Google Trends also reveals that the great
increase in the public interest for the expression “fake news” coincided with a
change in the focus of Web searches. Table 3 shows the five most frequent search
terms employed by users who also searched for “fake news” in the periods before
and after the US election.
We observe that,

for “fake news” were generic and regarded topics related to the media industry
itself, like “article”, “stories” and “report”; after the US election, however, these
searches started to be more focused on political
affairs and in the spread of
fake news, mentioning entities like the elected president of the United States of
America in 2016 (Donald Trump), the television news channel CNN (that devotes
large amounts of
its coverage to US politics) and the social
media Facebook
(considered a major source of fake news on the Internet).

In this section, we used data obtained from the Google Trends tool. From the
next section on,
however,
all
of our analyses use the data described in Section
2, obtained from the NOW Corpus.
3.2
Co-occurring named entities
The analysis of
named entities
– that is,
real-world entities such as persons,
organizations and locations that can be denoted with proper names [26]
– co-
occurring with certain terms is an interesting way to contextualize these con-
cepts.
In our case,
by identifying which entities are linked to the expression
“fake news” in different periods of time and in different parts of the world,
we
are able to observe relationships of “who and where” in the recent history of our
key-term.
In our dataset of
news articles,
we employed a simple method to identify
named entities: we made use of the fact that newspapers and magazines consis-
tently capitalize nouns representing named entities and counted all
the words
that appear capitalized in the contexts;
then,
we manually analyzed the most
frequent capitalized words in each subdivision of
the corpus (i.e.
representing
each region and period) to remove words not relative to named entities (such
as “I”, “SMS”, “March” and words capitalized for other reasons) and to merge
duplicated entities represented more than once (e.g. “Donald” and “Trump”).
Table 4 shows the five most mentioned named entities in the periods before
and after the 2016 US presidential election, regardless of geographical origin of
the corresponding news media. Before the US election, it is possible to observe a
strong connection between humor and fake news: with exception of Facebook, all
the other most mentioned named entities are related to satirical TV shows and
hosts based in the United States of America.
On the other side,
in the period
after the US election,
there is a movement towards politically related entities
(Donald Trump), traditional media sources (CNN) and social networking services
(Facebook and Twitter).
It is interesting to notice that this shift matches the
already mentioned (in Table 3) shift of interest towards political affairs and the
spread of fake news observed in Web searches.
Table 4: Most mentioned entities in the periods before and after US election.

Entities

When we make this same diachronic comparison,
but now considering the
geographical
origin of the corresponding news media,
we observe a noteworthy
phenomenon:
the global
standardization of

news. Table 5 indicates that local entities are more relevant in the period before
the US election, when names of geographical regions (Ekiti), countries (Nigeria,
China), local political parties (PDP – People’s Democratic Party of Nigeria, BJP
– Bharatiya Janata Party of India) and local personalities (Shahid Afridi, King
Salman, Korina Sanchez) appear frequently among the most mentioned entities.
In the contexts after the US election,
however,
Donald Trump,
Facebook and
US are the three most mentioned entities for nearly all
the regions – with the
sole exception of The Americas, where CNN replaces US.

3.3
Semantic fields of the surrounding vocabulary
Besides the investigation of the named entities that accompany a given key-term,
the analysis of the general
vocabulary co-occurring with it is also valuable.
In
our case, one of the possible methods of performing such analysis is by observing
the semantic fields (i.e.
groups to which semantically related items belong) of
the words co-occurring with the expression “fake news” in our contexts.
For performing this task, we first lemmatized all the words in the contexts by
employing the WordNet Lemmatizer function provided by the Natural Language
Toolkit [3] and using verb as the part-of-speech argument for the lemmatization
method. By applying this lemmatization, we grouped together the inflected forms
of
the words so that they could be analyzed as single items based on their
dictionary forms (lemmas).
Perception and conceptualization of the term “fake news” in the media
9
Then,
we used Empath [9],
“a tool
for analyzing text across lexical
cate-
gories”
5
, to classify the lemmatized words according to categories that represent
different semantic fields, such as diverse topics and emotions. For every context,
we calculated the percentage of
words belonging to each semantic field repre-
sented by an Empath category. Due to the high number of categories predefined
by Empath (194 in total), we selected eight that showed interesting results and
are relevant for our discussion: government, internet, journalism, leader, negative
emotion, politics, social
media and technology. By way of example, the category
internet
includes 79 words such as homepage,
download and hacker,
while the
category journalism contains 69 words, including report, article and newspaper.
Figure 2 displays the average percentage of words in these categories for all
the six regions considered here, both before and after the 2016 US election. By
analyzing the graphs presented, we observe interesting differences and trends re-
garding the quantitative utilization of words from the semantic fields considered.
We highlight the high increase in the use of words from the related categories
government,
leader and politics (and also from the supposedly unrelated cat-
egory negative emotion) and the high decrease in the use of
words from the
categories internet, journalism and technology (but not social
media) in almost
all regions after the US election.

We hypothesize that these results indicate a change in the focus of the news
considered here: before the 2016 US election, the term “fake news” was probably
more mentioned in contexts in which the focus was the environment where they
occur (Internet, newspapers etc.), sometimes even meta-discussions on the very
topic of fake news and its dissemination; during and after the US election, how-
ever, the discussion seems to have migrated to themes more close to the content
of the fake news themselves (politics, elections etc.).
3.4
Co-occurrence networks
Another possible method of investigating the vocabulary accompanying a key-
term in a corpus is through the observation of co-occurrence networks.
In our
case,
this method enables us to visually analyze the words that co-occur with
the expression “fake news” in the contexts that we are considering.
Here,
we
compare co-occurrence networks between the periods before and after the 2016
US election,
regardless of
the geographical
origin of
the media outlets.
These
networks are represented here by graphs,
in which each node corresponds to a
word and each edge corresponds to an association between two given words.

(b) After US election
Fig. 3: Co-occurrence networks of words before and after the 2016 US election.
To build our graphs of co-occurring words, we followed the steps below. First,
we counted the number of contexts in which two given words co-occur, so that we
have the volume of co-occurrences for each pair of words. Then, we normalized
these values in order to work with percentages instead of working with the ab-
solute number of co-occurrences. To improve the visualization of the graphs, we
filtered out minor relationships and highlighted the strongest ones by removing
nodes and edges when the co-occurrence percentage was lower than 0.8% (for the
Perception and conceptualization of the term “fake news” in the media
11
period before the US election) and 0.5% (for the period after the US election),
and by plotting the width of the edges proportionally to the strength of asso-
ciation between two given words.
Finally,
we obtained the maximum spanning
trees of both graphs, which are presented in Figure 3.
This method of investigation enables us to make several qualitative observa-
tions.
Comparing the two graphs,
we notice clear changes in the relationships
between the words co-occurring with “fake news” in our contexts. For instance,
before the US election, the main cluster contains words related to the news in-
dustry itself (“article”, “stories”, “hoax”) and to Internet (“website”, “twitter”,
“facebook”,
“account”).
Corroborating previous findings (Section 3.2),
there is
also another cluster containing words referring to satirical TV shows and hosts
(“daily”, “show”, “colbert”, “oliver”, “stewart”). In the graph representing the
period after the 2016 US election,
we start to observe terms linked to specific
events,
mainly the US election itself.
Interestingly,
some terms that surround
meta-discussions about fake news also appear, highlighting relevant related con-
cepts: fact check, hate speech, post truth and alternative facts.
3.5
Topics addressed in the contexts
In addition to studying the vocabulary around a key-term, it is also possible to
find the main topics addressed in the pieces of text surrounding the occurrences
of the expression “fake news” in our corpus.
For this task, we used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [4], a way of automat-
ically discovering topics discussed in texts. First, we lowercased and tokenized all
the words in the dataset. Then, we removed stop words using the list provided by
the Natural Language Toolkit – after having added the words “fake” and “news”
to this list, since they appear in all contexts. Finally, we ran the LDA algorithm
using gensim [21], a Python library for topic modeling. We used topic coherence
score [18] to choose the optimum number of topics k to be returned by the algo-
rithm. Thus, for each region, we ran the LDA algorithm starting with k=2 and
ending with k=20, and chose the best LDA model, that is, the LDA model with
highest topic coherence score.
All
regions had,
respectively,
k=2 and k=14 for
the periods before and after the US election, except The Americas, that had k=8
and k=14.
For each region,
the LDA returned these k topics containing words
ordered by importance in the corresponding context, filtered both by region and
topic.
We then selected the most important topic as the representative of each
region and period. Table 6 shows the main topic for each region in both periods
(before and after the US election) and the top ranked ten words produced by
our LDA model.
Unlike in the period before the US election, the words related to each topic
inferred by LDA are cohesive among each other in the period after the US
election.
We observe,
for all
regions,
a relevant frequency of
words related to
politics and social networks in the period after the US election. More specifically,
the words “russian”, “russia”, “election” and “facebook” rank high in this period.
In the period before the US election, most of the top words are related to Internet
and to the spread of misinformation, in all regions.

Polarity
Our final
analysis explores a different feature of the contexts in which the ex-
pression “fake news” appear in our dataset:
their polarities,
that is,
whether
the expressed opinion in the texts is mostly positive, negative or neutral. Here,
we performed sentiment analysis [23] in each one of the contexts in our dataset
using SentiStrength
6
[25], a tool able to estimate the strength of positive and
6

Perception and conceptualization of the term “fake news” in the media
13
negative sentiment in short texts. Given a piece of text, this tool returns a score
that varies from -4 (negative sentiment) to +4 (positive sentiment).
We are interested in analyzing how polarity changes over time and in different
regions when it comes to “fake news” and how this can be perceived in our
dataset. Figure 4 depicts the average polarity of the contexts in each region before
and after the 2016 US presidential election. We first observe a clear dominance
of negative polarities in all
periods and regions,
indicating that the term “fake
news” is often related to negative words [28]
and sentiments – which is not
surprising, since the concept of fake news seems to be strongly associated with
negative concepts,
like misinformation,
manipulation and the spread of untrue
facts.
Fig. 4: Average polarity of the contexts in each region before and after US election
(bars indicate the standard error of the mean).
In this figure, we also observe that, in general, the polarity expressed in the
contexts in the period after the US election is more negative than before.
The
only exception is in the British Isles,
where the difference of
polarity between
the periods is not statistically relevant. This result seems to corroborate findings
presented in previous sections of
this article,
which demonstrated that,
before
the 2016 US election,
the term “fake news” was often linked to satirical
TV
shows and more general topics, while in the period during and after the election
the topics became more related to the spread of false information in the context
of political activity.
3.7
Summary of results
The most relevant outcomes of
the analyses presented in this section can be
summarized and integrated as follows:
– the interest for the term “fake news” suddenly increased after the 2016 US
election,
as indicated by the rise of
news about it and of
Google Search
queries for this expression (Section 3.1);
– this growth was accompanied by a change of framing around the term “fake
news” – from, for instance, topics regarding the media industry itself to those
related to political affairs (Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5);
14
E. Cunha et al.
– the named entities linked to the expression “fake news” not only changed
towards political topics, but also suffered from global standardization after
the US election (Section 3.2);
– the negativity of the news containing the term “fake news” increased after
the US election (Section 3.6).
All these results suggest that, as hypothesized in Section 1, the rise of public
interest in the term “fake news” came with changes in its conceptualization and
in the perception about it.

Concluding remarks
Due to the increased role of the Internet in modern societies,
topics regarding
misinformation and manipulation in online environments seem to be subject to
progressively more public debate and interest,
including from the traditional
media. Understanding how these topics are viewed through the eyes of opinion
leaders is crucial to comprehend how public opinion about them is being shaped
in present day.
In this article, we present a quantitative analysis on the perception and con-
ceptualization of
the term “fake news” in a corpus of
news articles published
from 2010 to 2018 in 20 countries. We investigate how media sources have been
reporting topics related to fake news and whether the rise of the public interest
in this very expression during and after the 2016 presidential
election in the
United States of America was accompanied by changes of perception and shifts
in sentiment about it. We observed changes in the vocabulary and in the men-
tioned entities around the term “fake news” in our corpus, in the topics related
to this concept and in the polarity of the texts around it after 2016, as well as
in Web search behavior of Google Search users interested in this concept.
We are also interested in understanding whether the term “fake news” is
framed differently across the globe – and, if so, which are these differences. The
existence of
such variations may result in different shifts in the meanings and
in the sentiments around these concepts in various regions of the world,
which
justifies this study as a way to more clearly understand how the public opinion is
being steered in the current context in different countries of the English-speaking
world.
In this paper, we analyzed the usage of the term “fake news” in a diachronic
perspective, but only considered two historical moments: before and after a key
event in the history of
this expression (the 2016 US presidential
election).
In
the future,
we plan to consider a larger spectrum of
periods,
particularly to
understand whether (and, if it is the case, when) the conceptualization of “fake
news” changed once again. We also intend to add analyses using data from other
relevant sources, including Twitter posts and Wikipedia edits.
