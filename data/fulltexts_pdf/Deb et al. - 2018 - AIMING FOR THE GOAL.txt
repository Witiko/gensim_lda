Abstract
We study reward-based crowdfunding campaigns,
a class of dynamic games with private
benefits and positive externalities where the key tension is one of coordination, instead of free-
riding. Two types of supporters participate: donors just want the project to succeed while buyers
just want the product offered.
We develop a theoretical model of crowdfunding in continuous
time and show that its predictions are consistent with high-frequency data collected from Kick-
starter.
We study buyer and donor dynamics under alternative platform designs and find that
the Kickstarter mechanism performs better for all players.
We extend the model to incorporate
social learning about quality, which reduces the donor’s ability to coordinate buyers’ actions.

Introduction
Reward-based crowdfunding platforms allow entrepreneurs to raise funds directly from a wide base
of supporters prior to the launch of a product.
A typical
campaign specifies a reward,
a fund-
raising goal,
and a deadline.
Backers only receive the product
if the goal
amount
is raised by
the deadline. While buyers may be considered the sole customer base for campaigns, reward-based
crowdfunding platforms also allow supporters to donate to a campaign and receive nothing in return.
In fact,
we calculate that
Kickstarter,
the largest
crowdfunding platform,
receives
32
percent
of
contributions from donors.
1
How do these different
stakeholders - buyers and donors - interact
throughout campaigns?
Motivated by Kickstarter, we study a dynamic contribution game with a deadline , with private
benefits and positive externalities.
Unlike the classic literature on dynamic contribution games
(Admati
and Perry,
1987;
Fershtman and Nitzan,
1991) that
focus on contributions of a public
good—a good that is non-rivalrous and non-exclusive—we focus on contribution games for a non-
rivalrous but
exclusive good.
2
The product
is exclusive in the sense that
a buyer can enjoy the
product only if she buys it.
This difference is economically substantive.
With exclusive goods,
buyers cannot
free ride on other buyers’ contributions.
Instead,
the key trade-off in our setting
is one of coordination:
buyers do not want to commit to buying if they think that the product is
not likely to be produced as they can buy a substitute instead or use the pledged money for other
consumption. Donors who simply care about the success of the campaign can alleviate some of this
coordination risk of buyers by donating funds.
The key contributions of this paper is to examine, both theoretically and empirically, how buyers
and donors interact in a dynamic contribution game. The equilibrium behavior predicted by our the-
oretical model closely matches our empirical findings using high-frequency data from Kickstarter.
The theory allows us to make welfare comparisons between the current design of crowdfunding plat-
forms like Kickstarter and other counterfactual mechanisms. We find that current platforms perform
better than alternative mechanisms that do not allow donations, or those that allow donations only

Kickstarter says the following on its website:
"Many backers are rallying around their friends’ projects.
Some are
supporting a new effort from someone they’ve long admired.
Some are just inspired by a new idea,
while others are
motivated to pledge by a project’s rewards...."

at the start or the end of a campaign. Finally, we incorporate social learning to analyze its effects on
contribution dynamics.
We find that uncertainty about product quality reduces the effectiveness of
donations in alleviating the coordination risk of buyers While we apply our model to the context of
crowdfunding, it is generally applicable to other dynamic contribution settings where contributors
pledge funds in exchange for some private benefits,such as naming rights.
Our starting point is a set of new stylized facts that we establish using novel data collected from
the largest platform,
Kickstarter.
We track all campaigns,
every twelve hours,
through one week
past the deadline, for over a year.
However, unlike prior empirical work on crowdfunding, our data
collection approach allows us to distinguish between buyers and donors.
First, we show that dona-
tions are important.
32 percent of campaign revenue come from donations and and donations are
important for all categories on the platform. Second, we show that the U-shaped pattern of comple-
tion time noted in the prior literature is driven by different backers.
3
Projects that finish early on are
driven mostly by buyers and projects that finish close to the deadline are driven mostly by donations.
These late-finishing campaigns represent 29 percent of successful projects, and here, donations ex-
ceed purchases four-to-one in terms of revenue.
Donations and purchases occur throughout time,
which motivates our study of their dynamics. Finally, we find that donations tend to drop off sharply
after a campaign meets its funding goal, while purchases continue.
This is consistent with donors
caring about the probability of success, but not necessarily the total amount of revenue raised.
We develop a theoretical
model
to investigate the strategic interactions between buyers and
donors .
We construct
a finite-horizon,
dynamic contribution game in continuous time.
Buyers
randomly arrive over time and there is a single representative long-lived donor. A campaign is char-
acterized in terms of the funding goal, a price, a deadline, and the key parameters that govern buyer
preferences and donor wealth.
4
A buyer, conditional on arriving, can either pledge to purchase the
product at the posted price or choose an outside option, which is allowed to change over time.
Ar-
riving buyers are uncertain about both future arrivals and the donor’s wealth. The donor is uncertain
about future arrivals.
The long-lived donor, representing the network of family and friends can choose to donate any
3
See for example Kuppuswamy and Bayus (2015).
4
The role of donors in contribution games is not well understood.
Lee and Persson (2016) highlights the importance
of informal financing and donations in a more classic investment setup and also takes the view that friends and family
have limited funds that needs to be used wisely.

amount,
at
any time,
until
the deadline.
5
The donor receives a fixed benefit
if the campaign is
successful.
The benefit is independent of the amount raised.
If the campaign meets the funding
goal,
all transactions are realized,
and if the campaign fails,
then the donor and buyers get their
pledges back. The buyers still bear the opportunity cost of pledging and not exercising their outside
option.
The role of the donor is to help coordinate the actions of potential buyers. He wants to maximize
the probability of reaching the goal while minimizing the amount that she donates. As buyers makes
their pledging decision based on their assessment of the probability of success of the campaign, the
donor has the ability to influence these expectations throughout time.
6
We analyze the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the dynamic contribution game.
Our central
focus is on the equilibrium that maximizes the probability of success of a campaign.
We call this
the “platform-optimal equilibrium." We show that the platform-optimal equilibrium is also optimal
for the donor.
We also characterize the buyer-optimal equilibria and describe the set of all perfect
Bayesian equilibria.
The equilibrium construction is not straightforward due to the richness of the payoff-relevant
state space.
Equilibrium behavior of buyers and the donor depend on total purchases,
donations,
and time remaining. We transform the problem and use an induction argument on the number of ad-
ditional buyers necessary for the campaign to succeed, given current donations and time remaining.
In characterizing this equilibrium,
we derive a recursive formula for the buyers’ beliefs about the
probability of success. The probability depends on current donations, belief about the wealth of the
donor, the arrival time of the next buyer, and probability of success from the perspective of the next
buyer. At each induction step, we also define the minimum level of aggregate donation necessary to
ensure that the next arriving buyer will purchase.
This in turn allows us to implicitly define cutoff
times after which buyers cannot be incentivized to buy, because the donor is out of wealth.
In the platform-optimal equilibrium, the donor continuously donates until he exhausts his wealth,
in a way that ensures that the next arriving buyer is willing to purchase. At the deadline, he donates
5
Kickstarter does not allow the entrepreneur to donate funds directly.
This motivates our assumption on the prefer-
ences and payoffs of the donor.
6
While our modeling choices are inspired by Kickstarter,
we make some simplifying assumptions.
We focus on
within-campaign dynamics and abstract away from competition on the platform and optimal campaign design.
We also
assume that there is a single product version offered at a fixed price with no capacity constraints, as our data indicates
that typically capacity constraints are not binding.
3
the remaining amount needed to meet the goal,
if he has any wealth left.
Buyers buy as long as
they arrive “early enough;" we show that there exist threshold times that depend on the number of
additional buyer arrivals required for success and the time remaining, such that a buyer purchases if
and only if she arrives before the threshold time.
We also derive some intuitive comparative statics. We show, unsurprisingly, that the probability
of success of a campaign is increasing in the duration of the campaign and decreasing in the number
of buyers required.
However,
and more surprisingly,
we show that the completion time is neither
monotonic in campaign duration nor in the number of buyers required. We show that our constructed
equilibrium is consistent with the data. Contributions can spike only at the start of the campaign and
again at the deadline, and are increasing smoothly in the interim.
This is because if buyers believe
that donor wealth is low, then the donor may initially donate to signal that he has enough wealth to
keep future buyers active. Also, at the deadline, if the donor has not exhausted his wealth, he would
donate the remaining required.
During the interim, the equilibrium strategy prescribes continuous
donations.
This matches the U-shaped distribution of revenue over the duration of campaigns.
Moreover, if arrivals do not occur soon enough, the donor may run out of funds early, i.e., reaching
a sufficient number of buyers early on is crucial for success. Late-finishing campaigns attract a large
amount of donations close to the deadline and just meet the goal, while early finishing campaigns
attract more purchases. These campaigns continue to raise revenue after success. Finally, donations
drop to zero once the campaign succeeds, while buying continues.
Our theoretical framework also allows us to ask how the existing mechanism on Kickstarter
performs relative to alternative mechanisms.
While optimal mechanism design is outside the scope
of this paper, we analyze three natural counterfactual settings:
a setting with no donations, one in
which the donor has only one opportunity to donate, at the start of the campaign, and one in which
the donor has only one opportunity to donate, at the end of the campaign.
We find that in all three
counterfactual settings, the probability of success is lower and welfare is lower for both donor and
buyers.
Note that the donor’s and buyers’ incentives are not aligned,
as the buyer does not want
to buy if the campaign is not sufficiently likely to succeed,
and buyers’ opportunity costs are not
internalized by the donor.
Thus,
the Kickstarter mechanism coordinates the actions of different
players better than the alternative mechanisms.
Finally, we extend our baseline model to allow for learning about product quality.
A perceived
4
benefit of crowdfunding is that it allows for social learning.
We consider an environment in which
each buyer privately receives a binary signal about product quality and updates based on current
pledges.
The model is a “bad news" model in which a high quality project only generates positive
signals. Buyers now care about the quality of the product conditional on the event that the campaign
is successful.
We characterize an equilibrium analogous to that in the setting without learning, and
highlight a new trade-off. As before, if the probability of success is too low, then buyers do not want
to incur the opportunity cost of pledging. Thus, donations can help to make buyers more optimistic.
However, if the probability of success of the campaign is too high, then success is not a strong signal
for quality, and buyers’ willingness to pay is low.
Therefore, donations increase the probability of
success,
but make the learning less effective:
a dollar of donation is less effective in encouraging
buyers, especially if there is large uncertainty about the quality of the project.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2,
we discuss the data and establish
new empirical
facts.
In Section 3,
we present
the theoretical
model.
In Section 4 we conduct
the equilibrium characterization and derives some comparative statics and testable predictions.
In
Section 4.4, we characterize the counterfactual equilibria, and in Section 5, we add social learning
to the model. The conclusion follows.
1.1
Literature on Crowdfunding
Our paper is closely related to a few recent works on crowdfunding.
Strausz (2017) solves a mech-
anism design problem for a model with uncertainty about the number of interested buyers in the
market if the entrepreneur faces a moral hazard problem.
He shows that the all-or-nothing mech-
anism,
where transactions only take place if a funding goal is reached,
is optimal from a social
perspective because the good is only produced if sufficiently many buyers are present to cover the
fixed cost of production.
If the entrepreneur faces a moral hazard problem—if she can run away
with the money raised without
delivering the product—the optimal
mechanism entails an ineffi-
ciently high funding goal. Deferred payments to the entrepreneur can alleviate this problem. We do
not model the moral hazard problem, but we do empirically investigate its presence using a second
data set on successful Kickstarter campaigns. We use natural language processing techniques on all
project updates (from the entrepreneur) and comments (from backers) and find that most negative
sentiment is related to delays, but not nondelivery of products.
5
Bagnoli
and Lipman (1989) shows in a richer environment,
but
with complete information,
that an equivalent mechanism even implements the first best.
7
Sahm (2016) and Chakraborty and
Swinney (2016) consider a reduced form of Strausz (2017),
but include a second stage of selling
after the crowdfunding campaign.
Ellman and Hurkens (2016) also considers a mechanism design
approach,
absent
moral
hazard,
but
where buyers can have idiosyncratic high or low valuations
for the product.
8
Their focus is on the possibility to price discriminate by allowing high-valuation
buyers to bid a higher price to increase the probability of success.
Strausz (2017) and the above
papers abstract
away from within-campaign dynamics,
which is the focus of our work.
We are
interested in a complementary question of how strategic donors and buyers interact dynamically to
affect the success of a campaign which also allows us to consider social learning.
Another closely related paper is Alaei et al. (2016). They also consider a discrete-time model in
which consumers arrive sequentially. However, Alaei et al. (2016) differs substantively from ours in
that they do not allow for donations nor for learning about quality. Thus, their results cannot capture
the dynamic interaction between purchasers and donors, or speak to our counterfactual analysis. Liu
(2018) allows for learning with strategic buyers; however, she also does not consider donations.
9
Empirically,
we are the first
to examine reward-based crowdfunding with both buyers and
donors.
10
Van de Rijt
et
al.
(2014) design an experiment
that
shows donations affect
key out-
comes, like success probability, on Kickstarter. Agrawal et al. (2015) analyze the role of friends and
family in equity-based crowdfunding campaigns for artists.
In equity crowdfunding,
contributors
buy shares of the company instead of receiving a product or just donating.
Agrawal et al. (2015)
show that local contributors (friends and family) are less responsive to the cumulative amount raised
than distant contributors. The authors conclude that this is because friends and family have superior
information about the project and they invest based on their private information.
For reward-based
crowdfunding with social learning, we assume that friends and family do not directly care about the
quality of the product because they do not receive any direct return like in equity crowdfunding.
Other recent equity crowdfunding work include Grüner and Siemroth (2017), Abrams (2017), and
Li (2017). Equity crowdfunding is closer to an investment game rather than a contribution game.
7
Agrawal et al. (2014) call this a “provision point mechanims” in their survey paper.
8
Chang (2016) analyzes the entrepreneur’s choice of a funding mechanism in a similar setup.
9
Chemla and Tinn (2016) and Chang (2016) also allow for aggregate uncertainty about demand by considering a two
and three period game, respectively.
10
Kim et al. (2017) empirically investigates contributions, but they abstract from donations.

Data and Empirical Evidence
We first give a very brief overview of reward-based crowdfunding campaigns in Section 2.1.
We
then describe the data sets that we create in Section 2.2 and document new stylized facts in Sec-
tion 2.3. Finally, we perform robustness exercises to our empirical analysis in Section 2.4.
2.1
Background
Crowdfunding is a relatively recent phenomenon.
11
Kickstarter is the largest platform in this space
and has helped fund over 142,000 projects, raising over 3.6 billion dollars from 14 million people.
12
Entrepreneurs post
projects with a funding goal,
a deadline,
prices for rewards,
and if desired,
capacity limits for each reward.
Rewards are typically the product
offered by the entrepreneur.
Kickstarter limits the length of a campaign to at most two months.
Individuals can pledge for a
particular reward level or they can pledge to donate any amount and receive no reward in return.
Individuals can also donate in excess of the reward amount.
The platform uses an “all-or-nothing”
model which means that transactions are realized if and only if the funding goal is reached by the
deadline.
The campaigns on Kickstarter are diverse, with rewards (products) ranging from documentary
films to new high tech products. The largest categories in terms of revenue are Games, Design, and
Technology.
Individuals and startups are common creators of campaigns.
For example, the Pebble
Smartwatch is one of the most successful Kickstarter campaign to date.
The campaign raised over
$20 million from a $500 thousand goal.
Large companies have recently started participating in
reward-based crowdfunding campaigns as well.

Summary Statistics
We create a new data of all campaigns posted on Kickstarter from March 2017 to June 2018 using
a web scraper.
We track the progress of each campaign,
every twelve hours,
through one week
11
The two largest platforms are Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which were founded in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
With
reward-based crowdfunding, individuals pledge to either buy the reward offered or pledge a pure donation. These services
differ from platforms,
such as Gofundme and Fundly,
that focus exclusively on donation-based campaigns.
Donation-
based platforms do not offer rewards; their aim is to raise money for causes. Other types of crowdfunding also exist, such
as debt-based crowdfunding (e.g., Prosper.com) and equity-based crowdfunding.

after a campaign’s specified ending time. Whereas prior papers on Kickstarter use data reporting an
aggregate measure of buyer and donor activity,
our data collection scripts capture information on
buyers and donors separately.
14
By text processing the campaign web pages, we recover the total
number of donors and total donor revenue every twelve hours. We do not have access to individual-
specific donations and cannot separate pure donations from donations occuring from contributions
above the reward price. However, the median number of donors per-period is one so we can usually
capture the actual donation amount.
We define buyers to be individuals who pledge for any reward
and conduct robustness to this definition in Section 2.4.
In addition to the information on buyers and donors, we also collect all the information presented
on the main campaign page.
This includes all updates by the entrepreneur as well as all feedback
from the community (comments) throughout the campaign.

Existing empirical work on Kickstarter has utilized data from Kicktraq, Kaggle or constructed data with similar key
features.
These papers include:
Kuppuswamy and Bayus (2015),
Grüner and Siemroth (2017) and Liu (2018).
The
empirics in these papers are based on the sum of revenue coming from both buyers and donors, divided by the number of
buyers and donors combined, each period.
15
We truncate the sample by dropping the bottom one percent and the top one percent of campaigns in terms of the
goal amount.
This removes campaigns with low $1 goals and campaigns with several million dollar goals (one in the
billions).
Repeating the analysis with the full data yields nearly identical results.
In addition,
we drop campaigns that
were removed by the creator and campaigns under copyright dispute.
8
days are possible.
There is a positive correlation between campaign length and goal (
ρ = .15
).
The
average goal amount is $19.4 thousand.
Unsuccessful projects tend to have higher goals than suc-
cessful projects. Also note that most campaigns fail—only 39 percent of campaigns are successful.
This number is slightly higher than the statistic reported by Kickstarter (35 percent) for all cam-
paigns since the platform’s inception,
suggesting the probability of success has increased slightly
over time.
Most projects offer several different rewards,
excluding the pure donation option available to
all campaigns.
The average number of buckets (rewards) included in each campaign is seven.
Suc-
cessful campaigns have more rewards.
Interestingly, 62 percent of buckets do not have a capacity
limits and when capacity limits are used by entrepreneurs,
only 18 percent of buckets ever reach
their limit.
Our model abstracts from capacity constraints, and this evidence suggests they are not
of first-order importance.
Table 1 also presents basic information on the two types of players in campaigns:
buyers and
donors.
Donors are important.
In terms of total
revenue,
donations make up 32 percent
of all
contributions made on Kickstarter. We calculate average revenues of $147 and $88 per twelve hours
for buyers and donors, respectively.
16
However, both distributions are heavily skewed to the right—
small amounts are common. Unsuccessful campaigns receive lower revenues from both sources.
There is rich heterogeneity in the types of projects posted on Kickstarter.
Table 2 presents the
same summary statistics reported in Table 1, but separately for the top four categories, as measured
by the number of campaigns.
The top four categories are:
Design,
Film and Video,
Games,
and
Technology.
We see that the percent of successful projects vary a lot by category.
For example,
game campaigns are twice as likely to succeed as technology campaigns, but games also have less
than half the average goal amount of technology campaigns. Donor revenue is higher for games, and
buyer revenue is not substantially lower. The table also shows that donations are at least 20 percent
for all four categories and that the probability of success is negatively correlated with the amount
of revenue coming from donations.
The games and design categories have the lowest percent of
revenue from donations across all categories in the data.
The categories with the highest values
are Dance, Journalism, and Theater—all categories with donations between 40-50 percent of total
revenue. In the modeling section, we will focus on a single project; however, one could capture the

Empirical Analysis
Buyers and Donors Contributions on Kickstarter
We establish a series of stylized facts with our data on buyer and donor contributions over time. We
return to these facts after discussing the model and equilibrium characterization.
Figure 1 contains histograms of two metrics:
(a) revenue relative to goal
(R /G )
at the end of
the campaign and (b) the period in which successful
campaigns reach their goal,
The left
panel
(a) shows that most campaigns are either unsuccessful or just reach their goal.
That is,
there is
considerable bunching at one. There is a thin tail beyond two that is not shown. The right panel (b)
shows the histogram of success times for 30-day campaigns.
The time index
t = 0
corresponds to
the first day the project is offered and
t
= 30
corresponds to the end time.
This horizon will also
be used with all subsequent time graphs.
The graph shows success times are bimodal with many
10
campaigns succeeding close to the start and close to the ending time. These facts are consistent with
the findings in existing work, such as in Kuppuswamy and Bayus (2015).

Our data allows us to explain a key feature of the bimodal pattern of success times.
The data
suggests that buyers and donors play a very different role depending on the time until the deadline.
We partition campaigns into three groups:
campaigns that succeed in the first three days (early),
those that succeed in days 3-27 (middle),
and those that succeed in the last three days before the
deadline (late).
With this partition,
there are 1,816,
3,725,
and 2,254 campaigns in each group,
respectively.
The graphs in Figure 2 shows there is a relationship between completion time and the type of
contributions being made.
Together,
the graphs show that for campaigns that succeed early,
both
donations and purchases are high,
but in campaigns that succeed close to the deadline,
donations
overwhelmingly exceed purchases. That is, there is a deadline effect that is driven by donors.
The left panel (a) in Figure 2 shows the average number of contributions coming from buyers
and donors over time. The combined curves presents a U-shape pattern of contributions, established
in earlier papers. However, this aggregate measure does not capture the selection of campaigns that
appear over time.
The right panel (b) segments campaigns into the three bins described above and
plots contributions from buyers and donors separately.

Buyer Contribution (% of Revenue)
Note:
(a) The mean count of donations, purchases, and the sum of donations and purchases for 30-day campaigns.
t = 0
corresponds
to the first day of the campaign;
t
= 30
corresponds to the ending time.
(b) Revenue share is defined as the the amount of period
donations (purchases), divided by the total amount of revenue (donations plus purchases) at the project end time.
There are three lines,
corresponding to: 1) campaigns that are successful within the first three days of posting, 2) campaigns that are successful in the last three
days before the ending time, 3) all campaigns in between. Graphed are 30-day campaigns.
Figure 2(b) shows that for campaigns that finish early, both donations and purchases are high:
nearly 17 percent (median, 14 percent) of total cumulative revenue is gathered within the first day
on average.
On the other hand,
for campaigns that finish close to the deadline,
donations exceed
purchases by a four to one margin.
The large mass of middle finishers see lower donations and
lower purchases both in early periods as well as in later periods.
18
Table 3 contains the descriptive statistics for the three groupings of campaigns and shows that
early finishing campaigns are quite different from late finishing ones.
Campaigns that finish close
to the start time tend to raise much more money relative to the goal, as compared to late finishers
(with mean
R /G = 8
for early finishers versus
R /G = 1
for late finishers,
and medians of 4 and
1, respectively).
The early- and late-finishing campaigns belong to different categories:
Film and
Video, Music, and Publishing are the top three categories for late-finishing campaigns, whereas, for
early finishers,
these campaigns belong to Games,
Design,
and Art.
This again suggests that the
within-campaign dynamics depend on campaign-specific details.
by the total amount of revenue per project. This controls for the fact that some campaigns raise much more than the goal
while others just reach the goal.
18
One anomalous finding from this analysis is that for campaigns that finish early, there is a small increase in donations
at the deadline. This is perhaps due to advertising or that donors also care about total amount raised.
12
Buyers and donors show different patterns around the success time of campaigns. Figure 3 plots
average buyer and donor revenue for 30-day campaigns three days before and three the completion
time (-3 corresponds to three days before success, +3 is three days after success). Only campaigns in
the middle bin appear in the plot. The plot establishes an important fact that we verify in the model:
there is a spike in donations and purchases just before success,
but once a campaign reaches its
goal, donations drop drastically and buyers remain active. That is, both buyers and donors exhibit a
deadline effect, spiking at success time and then decreasing to levels lower than prior to success. In
levels, average donation revenue decreases by more than half, dropping from $96 to $40. This result
can be interpreted as donors caring mainly about the campaign reaching its goal and is reasonable
since donors do not receive any rewards.
Donations should taper off after the campaign succeeds.
On the other hand, if buyers are interested in the product offered, then we would expect purchases
to not decline after campaigns succeed.

in terms of donor counts.
One possibility is that donors also care about total revenues,
however,
our theoretical
model
will
abstract
from this.
Interestingly,
Figure 3 shows that
buyer revenue
also declines in the post-success period.
One reason for this could be advertising as Kickstarter
highlights campaigns near success. This may raise purchases just before the success time compared
to after completion.
Another reason purchases decline may be related to increasing average prices
after campaigns succeed.
19
Our model can accommodate decreased purchases after completion,
however, we will not formally model this as we concentrate on prior-to-success/deadline dynamics.
Examining the Presence of Moral Hazard using Natural Language Processing
In this paper,
we abstract away from any potential moral hazard on the part of the entrepreneur.
To check the validity of this assumption,
we empirically investigate its in our setting.
To do so,
we create a second data set—a cross section of information on the near universe of Kickstarter
19
While some entrepreneurs close the highest price buckets,
they also decrease the capacity of lower buckets.
We
find that the percent of filled buckets decreases substantially from 2 percent to 11 percent immediately after success.
As
a result,
conditional on looking at buckets with capacity,
the mean bucket price increases by $5.40.
For buckets with
positive sales,
the mean price increase is substantially higher at $105.43 (median,
$10.75).
As an aside,
this suggests
that entrepreneurs give up to a 20 percent discount prior to the success of the campaign, calculated at average campaign
prices.
14
campaigns.
20
Included are all updates from the creator and all comments from backers for each
campaign.
These text
data form the basis of our analysis.
In total,
we obtain over 1.3 million
updates and over 10.4 million comments.
Comments and updates sometimes discuss the moral hazard issue directly.
Ironically, the last
update posted to the first ever Kickstarter campaign is titled "sorry for no updates" and reads:
21
"I didn’t head for the border with the cash. not yet at least...."
We do not know for certain if the product was ever delivered.
However,
sometimes updates and
comments do suggest successful or unsuccessful delivery, as we detail below.
We search all
messages (comments/updates) posted after completion for key terms (
T
) that
might be consistent or inconsistent with the presence of moral hazard.
For updates,
we search in
both the title and text, and for comments, we search just within the text body.
Our selected terms
appear in Table 4.
We concentrate on negative words only for comments and later confirm our
findings using natural language processing on all the text.

we calculate

Most projects contain at least one update regarding delivery and
the most frequently occurring negative terms involve delays.
There is a positive correlation among
the negative terms,
with the strongest
being "apologize" and "delay." Apologizing for issues or
problems is much more common than apologizing for failure or refund. Negative correlation occurs
between some positive and negative terms, such as "in the mail" and "cancel."
More updates are positive than negative.

We use targeted search queries and are able to collect information on 125,393 of the roughly 134,000 successful
campaigns at the time of data collection. We cannot recover comments and updates that are protected as they can only be
viewed if you supported the campaign.

22
Performing analysis on positive and negative words reveals a similar pattern to updates:
positive words occur more
frequently within and across projects than negative words in the comments.
However, we are concerned about inferring
incorrect sentiment: "I received" is different than "When will I receive?" This is why we utilize natural language process-
ing techniques.
Also,
we chose the word Terms of Use as several backers cite Kickstarter policy to return funds if the
project cannot be completed.

a measure that is bounded between -1 and 1 for each project,
with 1 meaning all comments only
contain positive terms.
There is a large mass at zero; 43 percent of this mass is due to updates that
contain neither positive nor negative terms.
The histogram shows that the distribution is heavily
skewed towards positive values, that is, terms such as "sent" dominate the appearance of terms such
as "delay" within projects.
It
is perhaps unsurprising that
creators tend to post
more positive news.
Figure 8 looks at
comments, and plots the density of the fraction of comments within projects that contain negative
terms. The plotted measure is

Panel (a) shows the unweighted density and (b) plots the weighted density,
where we weight by
the number of comments within each project.
The plot shows that less than a quarter of comments
within a project are negative. Comparing (a) to (b), we see that there is positive correlation between
the fraction of negative comments and the number of comments. That is, negative sentiment appears
concentrated.
For reference, Figure 9 shows the weighted distribution by each key term; the words
delay, issue, and problem are the most prevalent.
Finally,
we leverage all the data and use natural language processing techniques to decipher
message topics.
After cleaning the data,
we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and identify
200 topic clusters.
23
The results are consistent with the textual analysis above—most clusters do
not reflect the moral hazard issue.
For example,
two clusters related to shipping discuss customs
23
We perform the following data cleaning steps: (a) we convert the text to bag-of-words and remove short comments,
(b) we remove commonly used words that are not useful for classification (or stop words,
such as "a" and "the"),
(c)
we lemmatize the text (convert both nouns and verbs, such as running to run), (d) we create a frequency dictionary and
remove infrequently used words,
and (e) we add to the dictionary the results of analyzing contiguous words via an
n
-
gram model with
n = 4
(a computational linguistics model that decides if "not delivered" should be analyzed as a single
term).
This results in a corpus of 3.8 million comments with a dictionary of 26,000 words.
An example comment is
"have:the:cds:gone_out:yet:i:haven_t:seen:one:yet". See Rehurek and Sojka (2010) for a description of the algorithm and
the basics of implementation.

fees for EU backers.

.
Our analysis identifies five delivery clusters,
three regarding timing of
delivery (such as month),
one expressing concern about some backers not receiving their reward
(other backers is a key term), and another that includes the word scam and words likely relating to
projects in the games category.
We investigate requests for refunds as the algorithm groups words like refund, cancel, and not
respond together.
Performing a second LDA analysis on these comments identifies clusters involv-
ing product issues but also identifies projects where consumers demand refunds due to nondelivery.
An example includes the Tiko printer,
a project with 25,000 comments,
thousands from backers
asking for a refund (for years) due to nondelivery.
However,
these examples are rare,
so we feel
comfortable abstracting away from moral hazard for the purpose of this paper.
This is also in line
with Strausz (2017) who shows that the all-or-nothing mechanism implemented by Kickstarter in-
deed is optimal to alleviate the moral hazard problem,
albeit absent donors and strategic buyers.
Thus, it is not surprising that moral hazard is less of an issue in the data.
2.4
Robustness Checks
Our definition of a donation comes from backers selecting the donation box and entering an amount
or from backers paying more than the reward price. As previously noted, some rewards themselves
may be better interpreted as donations.
Examples include a lower priced reward that approximates
a thank you, or a more expensive reward that includes the product but also includes special recog-
nition.
The bias is only one direction: we are possibly understating the magnitude of donations on
the platform. This is not an issue, per se, but we would like to investigate what role this plays in the
results described above.
Given the number of projects and buckets per project, manually assigning a reward or part of a
reward as a donation is infeasible. There are over 380,000 rewards in the data. Instead, we perform
the following analyses.
First,
we assume the least
expensive bucket
represents a pure donation.
Next,
we assume the most expensive bucket represents a pure donation.
Finally,
we assume both
the least and most expensive buckets constitute donations.
We reprocess the data and repeat the analyses in the previous subsection,
but for brevity,
we
only show one result and describe the others. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the raw data with the

three robustness exercises, replicating the analysis of Figure 2(b)—donation revenue, as percentage,
over time for early, middle, and late completing campaigns. The figure shows an intuitive result: as
reward purchases are assigned as donations, the amount of revenue attributed to donations increases.
However, the figure also shows that qualitatively, our key finding remains, that donations spike at
the deadline for late-completing campaigns.
There are no noticeable spikes in donations for early-
or middle-finishing campaigns.

Note:
Replication of Figure 2(b) using different definitions of donation.
The left panel donates the origin version.
Next, we assign the
lowest priced bucket as donation.
The following assigns the highest priced bucket to donations.
Finally, the last panel moves both the
lowest- and highest-priced buckets to donations.
Our other empirical
results are also qualitatively similar.
For example,
recreating Figure 3,
or buyer and donor revenue around the success time,
yields similar results.
Both purchases and
donations spike—in the case of moving both the lowest and highest priced buckets to donations,
donations spike to the level of purchases—but both again decline after success.
Donations drop
by more than half in all scenarios.
Thus, we are confident that the empirical patterns uncovered in
Section 2.3 are not sensitive to potential measurement error.

Baseline Model of Reward-Based Contribution Games
In this section we introduce a continuous-time model of reward-based contribution game, inspired
by the mechanism implemented by Kickstarter.
25
25
Our model is related to that in Alaei et al. (2016), but substantively different because Alaei et al. (2016) do not have
donors as mentioned in Section 1.1.
18
A firm (entrepreneur) would like to raise a goal amount
G > 0
in time
T > 0
.
It can offer its
product at a price
p > 0
and it can also receive donations.
Time is divided into periods of length
∆
.
Most results focus on the limiting outcomes as
∆ → 0
.
The firm can only receive the funds if it
raises the goal amount
G
by the deadline
T
.
Players and payoffs.
There are two different types of contributors.
In every period
t ∈ T
∆
:=
{0, ∆, 2∆, . . . , T − ∆}
, a buyer (she) arrives with probability
∆λ
. As
∆ → 0
, the process
N
∆
t
counting
the number of arrivals up to
t
converges in distribution to a Poisson process
N
t
with arrival rate
λ > 0
.
We refer to the
N −
th buyer as buyer
N
.
All buyers have the same valuation
v > 0
for the
product. A buyer can either pledge the price
p
, or choose an outside option that gives her a utility of
v
0
> 0
.
We can interpret
v
0
as the utility a buyer gets from purchasing an outside good right away,
or simply the opportunity cost of pledging money for the rest of the campaign duration.
v
0
can also
be interpreted as a cost of disappointment when the campaign is not successful.
We assume that
v − p ≥ v
0
.
If a buyer has pledged and the campaign is unsuccessful,
she receives a payoff of
0
while if it is successful, she receives
v − p
.
Moreover, there is a long-lived donor (he) who values
a successful project at
W
.
Hence,
his payoff is
W − D
if the project is successful and aggregate
donations by time
T
are
D
. If the campaign is not successful, he receives a utility of
0
.
26
Buyers do
not observe the realization of
W
and only know that that it is drawn from a distribution on
(0, W )
with a differentiable,
strictly increasing cdf
F
,
f
:= F
0
,
W ∈ [0,∞]
.
27
We refer to a donor with
valuation
W
as donor
W
.
Timing of the game.
In every period,
if a buyer arrives,
she first decides whether to pledge
p
or not.
Then,
the donor decides whether and how much to donate.
Thus,
we can describe a
general history faced by a buyer in period
t
by

Strategies. Motivated by the kickstarter platform and in order to eliminate unrealistic equilibria,
26
If the donor is identical to the enterpreneur,
one might argue that the donor can take back any money that he has
donated in excess of
G
after a successful campaign.
It turns out that the equilibria we construct are also equilibria in a
game with a donor with such preferences but limited budget
W
.
27
We do not allow buyers to donate:
they can only pay exactly a price
p
.
If buyers were able to donate, which they
might rationally want to do because they care about the success of the project, then their belief over
W
can be thought to
be heterogeneous across buyers as they know their own social value. For simplicity we abstract away from this.
19
we focus on strategies of the buyer that only depend on limited information about the history.
We
assume that a buyer in period
t + ∆
only observes aggregate donations
D
t
at the end of time
t
, the
number of buyers
N
t
who have arrived by the end of period
t
, and time

.
We denote the time left
until the deadline by
u := T − t .
Thus, we assume that a buyer only observes a reduced history of the form
˜
h
B
= (D , N , u) ∈
˜
H := [0, W ] × N × [0, T ].
Note that this is indeed also the payoff-relevant history for a buyer. Then, the strategy of a buyer in

Our main focus is to characterize the equilibria that maximize the probability of success of a
campaign. We call such an equilibrium “platform-optimal." Later we discuss the full set of PBE.
Remark 1.
We can allow for the outside option to vary over time and for buyers to discount time
without qualitatively changing the equilibrium characterization in Proposition 1.
For example, one
can imagine that the opportunity cost of pledging for a product is smaller close to the deadline than
at the beginning of the campaign.
We present the proof in Appendix 4.2 for such general outside
options, but focus on constant

Analysis of the Baseline Model
We start
with a few preliminary results in Section 4.1.
Then,
in Section 4.2,
we construct
the
platform-optimal equilibrium,
which maximizes the probability of success,
and show that this is
also the donor-optimal PBE. We derive some equilibrium properties that allow us to establish com-
parative statics results in Section 4.3. We also discuss how the equilibrium outcome and comparative
statics are consistent with the key empirical facts and what limitations we face when trying to test
our model using our data. Finally, we compare the Kickstarter mechanims with alternative platform
designs in Section 4.4 and show that the Kickstarter mechanism makes all players better off com-
pared to those benchmarks.
This highlights the donor’s role in helping buyers to coordinate their
actions over time by alleviating their risk.
4.1
Definitions and Preliminary Results
For any
∆
we construct a PBE given
p ,G , T , λ, v
0
> 0
.
First,
it is immediate that given that the
buyers’ strategies only depend on the payoff-relevant state in
˜
H
,
the donors’ best response after
any history also only depends on the payoff-relevant state
˜
H
without loss of generality, as it is also
28
We do not think this assumption is necessary for the main qualitative insights of the paper though.
21
the donor’s payoff-relevant state.
Thus,
from now on we write the donor’s strategy as a function
d
∆
:
˜
H → R
with a slight abuse of notation.
Finally, instead of characterizing donations in every
period, we rather report the aggregate donation strategy
D
+
∆
(D , N , u; W ) := D + d
∆
(D , N , u ; W )
which uniquely pins down
d
∆
(D , N , u ; W )
.
The challenge for the construction is that even the payoff-relevant state space
˜
H
is rich, making
standard induction arguments over time impossible.
Instead, we recast the problem as an induction
proof on the number of additional buyers needed in order for the project to reach success,
given
current total donations and time. Before stating the equilibrium characterization, we introduce some
notation. First, we define the number
M (D )
of buyers that are needed given total donations
D
, if no
further donations are made. That is,
M (D )
is the unique integer satisfying
(M (D ) − 1) · p < G − D ≤ M (D ) · p.
Given aggregate donations
D
and aggregate number of buyers
N
,
j = M (D ) − N
more buyers need
to arrive and purchase to reach the goal.
The induction argument will be on this number
j
.
Let the
number of buyers needed to fund the project absent donations be
M
0
:= M (0).
Another useful
piece of notion is the probability
π
∆
(D , N , u )
of reaching the goal
from the
perspective of buyer N+1 if she buys in state
(D , N , u )
. Buyer
N +1
buys given state
(D , N , u )
, i.e.,
b
∆
(D , N , u) = 1
, if and only if
π
∆
(D , N , u ) · (v − p )
≥
v
0
.
(2)
Two sources of uncertainty and the equilibrium strategies of the donor and future buyers affect this
probability.
First, buyers are uncertain about the wealth of the donor and they update their beliefs
based on the amount donated
D
over time.
Second,
both types of agents face uncertainty about
future arrivals.
22
4.2
Equilibrium Characterization
Since we mostly focus on the limiting outcomes, let us define
π(D , N , u ) := lim
∆→0
π
∆
(D , N , u )
whenever it
exists.
It
follows from the proof in the Appendix that
this limit
is well-defined for
the equilibrium we are constructing.
Then,
for the characterization of the equilibrium strategy of
the donor,
it is useful to define the minimum amount of aggregate donations
D (N , u)
required to
guarantee that buyer
N +1
buys, for any
N < M (D )
and
u
. We show that in the limit this amount is
uniquely given by
π(D (N , u ), N , u ) =
v
0
v − p
.
(3)
In the limit,
the donor donates a positive amount if and only if
D < D (N , u)
.
If he donates,
he donates such that
aggregate donations equal
D (N , u)
until
donations exhaust
his wealth,
W
.
As soon as
D (N , u)
reaches
W
and the donor stops donating, the next buyer does not buy almost
surely as she knows that the donor has run out of money. Thus, for any
j = 2, 3, . . .
and
W
such that
M (W ) ≥ j
, we define
ξ
j
(W )
by
π(W , M (W ) − j , ξ
j
(W )) =
v
0
v − p
.
(4)
ξ
j
(W )
represents the time remaining until the deadline
T
at which the donor
W
runs out of funds,
if
j
more buyers were needed to reach the goal. Moreover, let
ξ
i
(W ) = 0
for all
i < 2
and
W ≥ 0
.
29
After
ξ
j
(W )
periods from the deadline,
the probability of success drops to zero.
Note that there
is asymmetric information about
ξ
j
(W )
:
The donor knows
W
, but buyers must form expectations
over
W
and only knows
ξ
j
(W )
is reached and no donations are being made.
Proposition 1.

there exists an equilibrium

properties:

We allow

Buyers’ beliefs are are given by

F (w ) − F (D )

(7)
iv)
The limiting probability of success (as
∆ → 0
) from the perspective of buyer
N + 1

N <
M (D ) − 1
satisfies

as long as
D ≥ D (N , u)
.
If donations are less than
D (N , u)
,
then
π(D , M (D ) − j , u) = 0
.
Finally,
π(D , N , u) = 1
for all
N ≥ M (D ) − 1
.
v)
On equilibrium path,
buyer
M (D ) − j + 1
buys as long as the donor donates,
i.e.,
u ≥
ξ
j
(M (W ))
.
This limiting equilibrium outcome has a clean structure.
Buyers buy as long as the donor’s
wealth is not depleted which is characterized by a cutoff times
ξ
j
(W )
from the deadline. Aggregate
donations are always such that
the next
buyer who arrives is indeed willing to buy.
Hence,
the
probability of success can be calculated recursively.
Only in the last period
T
the donor would
always contribute the remaining amount needed to lead to success of the campaign if his wealth
suffices. The formal proof is relegated to the Appendix.
The equilibrium in Proposition 1,
moreover,
has some nice properties.
First,
it
implies that
donations can have a discrete spike only at the start and at the deadline:
A spike of
D (0, T )
can
24
occur at
t = 0
to ensure that buyers assign a sufficiently high success probability. At
t = T
, donation
spikes can occur to ensure success.
In between, aggregate donations increase smoothly and drop to
zero after a buyer pledges. This pattern is consistent with what we observe in Figure 2.
30
However, the contribution game supports a large set of other equilibria.
Next, we characterize
the full set of equilibria and show that the equilibrium described in Proposition 1 is platform-optimal
and donor-optimal.
In order to characterize the set of PBE, it is convenient to consider a special case of Proposition
1 where
F (W ) ≡ 1
for all
W
, i.e.,
W ≡ 0
. Without donations, the payoff-relevant state of any project
can be reduced to
(N , u )
.
Let us denote the probability of success in state
(N , u )
by

define

which is the amount to be donated so that the next buyer is willing to buy even if no more donations
are being made. Note that the donor never wants to donate more than this amount in any equilibrium.
Proposition 2.
Characterization of set of PBE
i)
In every PBE,
D
+
(D , N , 0; W ) = min{max{D ,G − N p }, W }
and for
u > 0
min{max{D (N , u), D }, W } ≤ D
+
(D , N , u; W ) ≤ min{max{D (N , u), D }, W }
ii)
The equilibrium in Proposition 1 is both platform-optimal and donor-optimal.
While we focus on the platform-optimal equilibrium,
we construct the buyer-optimal equilib-
rium in the following example in order to provide some intuition for Proposition 2.
30
If the buyer arrival rate changes over time, qualitative results do not change.
However, instead of a constant inflow
of buyers, there can be times at which purchases increase or decrease on average which is anticipated by the donor and
buyers.
The donor’s strategy remains unchanged:
he donates just enough to incentivize the next buyer to buy.
A higher
arrival rate at the beginning of the campaign driven by increased advertising can explain the spike in purchases early on
in panel (b) of Figure 2. Note that this spike is alleviated when we also assign a few buckets to donations in Section 2.4.
25
Example 1.
Buyer-optimal Equilibrium The following constitutes an equilibrium for general
F
.
The donor’s strategy is given by
D
+
(D , N , u; W ) =



min{max{D ,G − N p },W }
for
u = 0
min{max{D , D (N , u)}, W }
for
u > 0
.
Buyers pledge if and only if their belief
π(D , N , w ) ≥
v
0
v −p
,
and equilibrium beliefs of buyers are
given by
˜
F (w ; (D , N , u )) =



F (w )−F (D )
1−F (D )
· 1(w ≥ D )
if
D ≥ D (N , u)
1(w ≥ D )
otherwise
.
In words, if buyers observe an off-equilibrium donation such that the aggregate donation is less than
the equilibrium expectation, they believe that the donor has exhausted his wealth.
Unlike in the equilibrium in Proposition 1,
the equilibrium in this example has bursts of do-
nations at
ξ
no
i
and no donations otherwise.
Qualitatively it shares similar features as it has many
donations occurring in period 0 and period
T
.
Note that in a game in which buyers know
W
, they
would buy in state
(D , N , u )
only if the realized wealth satisfies
W ≥ D (N , u)
.
Thus, this equilib-
rium implements the outcome in which there is no asymmetric information about
W
.
In particular,
this implies that total buyer surplus is maximized in this equilibrium.

Equilibrium Properties
We focus on properties of the platform-optimal equilibrium.
Most properties, however, carry over
to any other equilibria.
4.3.1
Preliminaries
First,
we show in Lemma 1 that we can assume without loss of generality that
λ = 1
because
λ
simply scales time in the model. Thus, any comparative statics with respect to
λ
is equivalent to the
comparative statics with respect to
T
.
Lemma 1.
Fix a goal amount

.
Thus,
G
and the deadline
T
are the the only payoff-relevant characteristics of a campaign given
v

and
F
.
Henceforth, we will therefore simply focus on comparative statics with respect to the
primitives
G
,
T
,
p
, and
v
0
v −p
.
One important implication of Proposition 1 is that a project has a non-zero probability of success
from a buyer’s (and researcher’s) perspective if and only if
u ≥ ξ
j
(D )
for observed donations
D
and
N = M (D ) − j
. It is useful to introduce the following definitions for limiting outcomes:
Definition 1.
i)
We call a campaign alive in states
(D , N , u )
such that
u > 0
and
u ≥ ξ
M (D )−N
(D )
.
We call a campaign dead in states
(D , N , u )
such that
0 < u < ξ
M (D )−N
(D )
.
ii)
We call a campaign successful if and only if
T ≥ τ
M (W )
and
T − ξ
M (W )− j
(D ) ≥ τ
j
for all
j = 1, . . . M (W ) − 1.
Denote this event by
S (G , T )
.
Next, denote
Π(G , T )
the probability of success of a campaign given by
G
and
T
.
It turns out
that
π(0, 0, u )
is increasing in
u
(See Lemma 3 in the Appendix).
This implies that the campaign
is successful only if the first buyer arrives before time
T − ξ
M (W )
(W )
at which the donor runs out
of funds.
Let
u
be uniquely defined by
π(0, 0, u ) =
v
0
v −p
.
Then, for
T < u
, the donor donates just
enough, so that the probability of success is exactly
v
0
v −p
by construction.
Thus, we can write the
ex-ante probability of success if
T ≤ u
as
Π(G , T )

Finally, let us denote the time of success of a campaign by

, where we set
τ = ∞
if
27
the project never gets completed.
4.3.2
Key Comparative Statics
Proposition 3 below establishes some comparative statics in our model. We prove the result formally
within the class of platform-optimal equilibria.
However from the proof approach,
it is clear that
analogous comparative statics are valid for the class of buyer-optimal equilibria as well.
32
Proposition 3.
i)
The ex-ante probability of success
Π(G , T )
is increasing in
T
and decreasing
in
G
.
ii)
Donations
D (0, T )
(at time
t = 0
) are decreasing in
T
, and increasing in
G
and
v
0
v −p
.
iii)
On equilibrium path,
the average aggregated donations
E
W ,(τ
j
)
T
j =1
[D
t
]
are decreasing in
T
,
and increasing in
G
and
v
0
v −p
.
iv)
For all
u > 0
and
N < M
0
,
D (N , u) < G − N p
.
Thus,
if a campaign succeeds before the
deadline, then it must be that it succeeds due to an arrival of a buyer at the time of success
τ
and zero donations between the previous arrival and
τ
(G ,T )
.
The proof of the proposition is in the Appendix.
Below, we describe how this result relates to
our data.
We also show that,
interestingly,
the expected time of success is not monotonic in the
primitives.
First, it is intuitive that the probability of success is higher if there is more time or if the goal
is lower,
i.e.,
if fewer purchases are needed.
Indeed,
higher goals and shorter time horizons are
associated with lower success rates both in Table 1 and 2.
We will see in Section 5 that this is not
necessarily the case any more if buyers engage in social learning.
Similarly, it does not seem surprising that the donor needs to contribute more at the onset of a
campaign if buyers alone are unlikely to be able to complete the project alone, i.e., if T is small,
G
is large or the outside option is relatively attractive (
v
0
v −p
).
This feature is robust across equilibria
and also carries over to the model with social learning.
The donation spike at the beginning of a
campaign is a clear empirical pattern that we observe in the data. It is, however, hard to empirically
test this comparative statics given the large heterogeneity of campaigns.
Part iii) generalizes this
32
For the class of buyer-optimal PBE,
statements (i),
(ii) and (iii) are unaltered,
while in statement (iv)
D (N , u)
is
replaced by the analogous
¯

.
28
observation to aggregate donations at any point in time.
This property is even harder to match with
the data.
Part iv) of Proposition 3 implies that campaigns that are completed strictly before the deadline
must do so because the number of arriving buyers “exceeds expectations.” This is consistent with
the empirical observation in Figure 2 (b) that the revenue share from purchases is quite high for
those projects that are completed in early periods.
Moreover, it can explain the spike in backing at
the completion time in Figure 3. The spike in donation revenues at the time of completion cannot be
explained by our model.
There can be some psychological reasons that induce donors to complete
the project, in particular if campaigns close to success are advertised on the Kickstarter platform.
Finally,
the following analysis of arrival times illustrates why it is difficult to use arrival time
information in order to test our model using the data. The realization of arrival times determines the
donation dynamics. In particular, the aggregate donation level can be written as
D
t
=
max

D (n, T − τ
n
)
n ∈ {0, 1, . . . }
and
τ
n
≤ t
.
(11)
As a result, the fewer buyers arrive early on, aggregate donations
D
t
are higher. In particular,
D
t
is
bounded from above by
D (0, T − t )
.
Figure 5 illustrates these definitions and the role of the primitives
T
and
G
.
It depicts a real-
ization of an arrival process if the deadline is equal to
T
1
.
In that case, the second arrival does not
occur “in time,” i.e., before time
T
1
− ξ
4
(W )
.
The donor runs out of funds to make sure that buyers
keep buying and the probability of success drops to zero.
This is consistent with the observation
that if a project is unsuccessful, it fails with few total number of buyers as illustarted in panel (a) of
Figure 1. The reason is that if buyers do not arrive sufficiently early, later buyers will not buy.
Figure 5 also illustrates the outcome if the deadline is extended to
T
2
> T
1
.
For the considered
realization the project succeeds at some time
τ
(G ,T )
≤ τ
5
where the exact timing of success depends
on the distribution of donor wealth
F (W )
. The next section elaborates more on the timing of success.
The following lemma follows immediately from (11).

While early arrivals result in lower donation levels, if some arrivals occur earlier and some later,
one cannot clearly order the donation level without taking into account details of the parameters
of the campaign.
In particular,
if for example two arrivals occur with

but
τ

,
it is
ambiguous which campaign has higher donations at the deadline without taking into account the

Similarly, it can be easily shown that the expected time of success does not change monotoni-
cally in
G
and
T
(and hence
λ
).
For example, reducing
M
0
has two opposing effects.
Consider a
realization of arrivals that is in
S (G , T )
.
If success occurs prior to the deadline, an arrival at time
zero,
must increase the time of success by Proposition 3 iii).
If the campaign is completed at the
deadline, then an additional arrival at time zero results in success strictly before or at the deadline
as well.
Next, consider a realization of arrivals that is not in
S (G , T )
, but that results in success if
an arrival is added at time zero as in Figure 5.
In that case, the time of success is on average high.
The overall effect can be negative or positive depending on the value of
M
0
.
Next,
we show that a decrease in
G
given
T
increases the time of success if and only if an
increase in
T
increases the probability of success given
M
0
.
Let
E
(G ,T )
[τ
(G ,T )
|S (G , T )]
be the
expected time of success conditional on the project being successful. We can write for
ε → 0

Timing of Donations
So far, we have argued that our model is consistent with key facts about the dynamics of contribu-
tions on Kickstarter. A natural next question is whether it is possible to improve on this mechanism.
While optimal dynamic mechanism design is outside the scope of this paper, we analyze three sim-
ple counterfactual settings.
First, we analyze a setting in which donations are not allowed, and find
that the probability of success is lower than when donations are allowed.
This is per se unsurpris-
ing, but leads to the natural question of how to optimize the timing of donations.
To this end, we
analyze a setting in which the donor has only one opportunity to donate at the start of the campaign
(i.e.,
u = T
) and a setting in which the donor has only one opportunity to donate at the end of the
campaign (i.e.,
u = 0
).
The case in which donations are not
allowed is analyzed in Example 1.
The equilibrium is
unique and the ex-ante probability of the project being successful in equilibrium can be written as
Π
no
(G , T ) :=
Z
max{T −ξ
no
,0}
0
λe
−λs
π

(0, T − s )d s .
If the donor has only one opportunity to donate at the start of the campaign, then given any donation
level
D
, the game is identical to one with no donations, but with
M (D )
buyers required instead of
M (0)
. There is a unique PBE in which the donor chooses an optimal donation level
D

so that
Π
0
(G , T ) := E
W

max
D≤W
Π

(G − D , T ) · (W − D )

.
Finally, consider the setting in which the donor can only donate at the deadline.
There exists a
unique equilibrium that can be constructed analogously to Proposition 1 with
D = 0
up to period
T
.
Corollary 1.
If the donor can only donate at the deadline
T
, there is a unique equilibrium that is
described as follows. As

,
31

If
N = M

is hence
1 − e

and
ξ

.
Let the ex-ante probability of success in this equilibrium be denoted by
Π
T
(G , T )
.
The following proposition compares the outcome of the counterfactual mechanisms with that in
the baseline model where continuous donations are allowed.
Proposition 4.
Consider campaigns such that the ex-ante probability of success is strictly positive
in some equilibrium of the baseline model with continuous donations.
i)
The probability of
success in all
counterfactual
settings is strictly lower than that
in any
equilibrium of the baseline model.
ii)
Donor utility in all counterfactual settings is strictly lower than that in any equilibrium in the
baseline model.
iii)
The expected buyer utility in all counterfactual settings is lower than that in any equilibrium
in the baseline model. Some buyers are strictly worse off.
This result illustrates that allowing continuous donations benefits players as it allows the donor
to signal his wealth and thereby help buyers optimize their purchasing decisions, at a minimal cost
for the donor.
A first guess might have been that allowing donations only at the deadline may be
better for the donor,
since in the baseline model,
bad realizations about donor wealth can also be
learned.
However,
since the donor signals his wealth by donations only if buyers would not buy
otherwise,
he reveals his low wealth only if arrivals of buyers were so low that the project would
have died in the counterfactual in the first place.
The comparison of the ex ante probability of success between the two counterfactuals (with
donations only at
t
= 0
or only at
t
= T
) is ambiguous.
Below,
we present
an example with
32
p < G ≤ 2p
in which the ex-ante probability of success is higher in the case of donations only at
t = T
for sufficiently
v
0
v −p
is high enough.
We also analyze a relaxed problem in which the donor is committed to donate all his wealth
W
at the start since this allows us to explicitly compute the ex-ante probability of success:

◊
The first best in this game,
which maximizes the utility of donors and buyers,
is to produce
whenever
W + p N (T ) > G
.
This coincides with the entrepreneur’s incentive.
Thus, whenever the
project gets funded in all the above mechanisms, it is also optimal to do so. However, it may not be
33
produced due to free-riding and miscoordination of buyers and the donor.
More precisely, buyers
might decide not to buy because they think the project is unlikely to be successful too early.
5
Learning about Quality
In our baseline model we assume that the quality of the project is known. This model can explain the
key facts in the data qualitatively well. In practice, however, a widely mentioned benefit of reward-
based crowdfunding is that it allows entrepreneurs to learn about demand,
and enables potential
buyers to learn about quality from behavior of other buyers.
In this section, we incorporate social
learning into the baseline model to study how it interacts with the dynamic incentives of donor and
buyers.
Let
q ∈ {0, 1}
denote the quality of the product.
q
can be viewed as an unknown common value
component of demand or equivalently, the inherent quality of the product.
Buyers value a product
of quality
q
at
v (q ) = v · q
with
v > c
.
All players share a public prior that the quality is
q = 1
with probability
µ
0
and
0
otherwise.
In addition, every buyer privately observes a signal
s ∈ {0, 1}
such that
P(s = 1|q = 1) = 1
and
P(s = 1|q = 0) = α
.
Hence, a buyer who receives a bad signal
s = 0
knows with certainty that the quality is low (
q = 0
).
Now, upon arrival, buyers not only form beliefs about the donor’s value
W
, but also about the
quality of the product. Let
µ
t
denote the public belief about quality at time
t
prior to observing the
private signal. The payoff relevant state for a buyer in this game can then be described by
X
∆
t
≡ (D , N , u, µ
t
).
Analogously to the base model, denote the limiting strategy (as
∆ → 0
) of buyers by
b (X
t
, s )
where
X
t
≡ (D , N , u, µ
t
)
.
The updated public belief in period
t + ∆
depends on whether a purchase was
observed or not.
Let
µ
B
t +∆
and
µ
N
t +∆
denote the updated public belief after a purchase and after no
34
purchase in period
t
, respectively. The evolution of public beliefs on equilibrium path is given by:
µ
B
t +∆
=



µ

if
b (X
t
, 1) = b (X
t

µ

+(1−µ

if
b (X

and
b (X
t
, 0) = 0
and
µ
N
t +∆
=



µ
t
if
b (X

+(1−µ
t
)e
−λα∆
if
b (X
t
, 1) = 1
and
b (X
t
, 0) = 0
.
Note that if on equilibrium path all or no buyers buy, then no learning takes place and the belief about
the quality remains constant. Furthermore, in the limit as
∆ → 0
, if
b (X
t
, 1) = 1
and
b (X
t
, 0) = 0
on
t ∈ (s
1
, s
2
)
, then conditional on no observed purchase
˙
µ
t
=
−λ(1 − α)µ
t
(1 − µ
t
).
(12)
Let
µ
s
t
,
s ∈ {0, 1}
be the private posterior belief of a buyer who enters when public belief is
µ
t
and
the buyer receives a signal
s
. The posterior is computed using Bayes Rule, i.e.,
µ
1
t
=
µ
t
µ
t
+(1−µ
t
)α
and
µ
0
t
= 0
.
Finally, let us denote the probability of success conditional on quality
q
by
β
q
(X
t
) := P(S (M
0
, T )|X
t
, q ).
Then, a buyer who sees signal
s = 1
buys if and only if
B (X
t
) ≡ (v − p ) · µ
1
t
· β
1
(X
t
) − p · (1 − µ
1
t
) · β
0
(X
t
)
≥
v
0
.
(13)
If buyers who see
s = 1
do not buy given the current donation level,
then the project will not be
funded.
A project stays alive if and only if either at the current donation level
D
(13) is satisfied or
additional donations cannot incentivize buyers to buy.
We show in the proof of Proposition 5 that
B (X
t
)
is increasing in
D
.
Thus, we can define
D (N , u, µ
t
)
as for the benchmark model implicitly
by
B (D (N , u, µ
t
), N , u , µ
t
) = v
0
.
(14)
35
The proposition below characterizes an equilibrium analogous to the one in Proposition 1 in this
setting with learning. The interested reader can refer to the Appendix for the proof.
Proposition 5.
The equilibrium analogous to the one in Proposition 1 has the following properties:
i)
If
µ
t
≤
¯
µ
1
:=
(v
0
+p )(1−α)
(v −(v
0
+p ))α−(v
0
+p )(1−α)
, a buyer does not buy, regardless of her private signal. The
campaign succeeds if and only if
W ≥ G − N p
, where
N
is the number of purchases so far.
ii)
If
µ
t
>
¯
µ
1
, then buyers with
s = 1
buy until the donor runs out of funds.
iii)
When
µ
t
>
¯
µ
1
, until the donor runs out of funds, the public belief evolves according to (12).
In order to understand the relationship to the baseline model, it is useful to write an inequality
analogous to (2) that
describes when a buyer pledges.
Denote as before the event
in which the
project succeeds by
S (G , T )
. A buyer with private belief
µ
s
t
buys in period
t
if and only if
E

(v q − p ) · 1(S (G , T ))|X
t
, s

≥ v
0
.
Rewriting the inequality yields an analogous expression to (2):
P(S (G , T )|X
t
, s )

E

v q · 1(S (G , T ))|X
t
, s

P(S (G , T )|X
t
, s )
− p

≥ v
0
.
Instead of the fixed valuation
v
, with learning, a buyer cares about the quality conditional on success
E
[
v q ·1(S (G ,T ))|X
t
,s
]
P(S (M ,T )|X
t
,s )
.
This valuation is decreasing in total donations
D
because less learning about
quality can take place if a higher fraction of the goal is funded through donations which makes
success a weaker signal of quality.
Thus, one dollar of donations is less effective in incentivizing a
buyer to buy.

Conclusion
In this work we analyze the dynamic strategic interaction between contributors with fundamentally
different
preferences in a new type of contribution game.
We show that
our proposed model
is
consistent with data collected from Kickstarter and we use the model to show how the mechanism
improves welfare for all contributors and the entrepreneur compared to similar mechanisms with
different timing. Social learning can alleviate the benefit of donations in incentivizing purchases.
36
Our results give rise to a number of follow-up research questions both for the application of
crowdfunding and for the understanding of alternative contribution games.
For example, version-
ing for such semi-public goods gives rise to novel trade-offs.
Similarly, the interaction with equity
crowdfunding and optimal mechanism design are important questions.
At the same time one can
imagine the donor or entrepreneur to discount time and to choose the optimal stopping time to com-
plete the project. How long should an entrepreneur wait before she gives up or starts production of a
project? Finally, dynamic strategic interactions of players with fundamentally different preferences
can be relevant in other domains.

Proofs of Section 4
A.1.1
Proof of Proposition 1
We prove a more general version of Proposition 1 where the outside option can depend on time as
discussed in Remark 1. Thus, in the following, we allow
v
0
to be a functiton
v
0
(u )
for all definitions
in the main text.
Proof.
(Proposition 1)
Step 1 (Last period;
u = ∆
): First, consider the donor in period
T − ∆
.
Suppose that the donor
is in a history in which aggregate donations are
D
and the number of purchasers is
N
.
Then,
the campaign only succeeds if at
the end of period
T
,
aggregate donations
D
+
∆
(D , N , 0)
satisfy
N p + D
+
∆
(D , N , 0) ≥ G
.
Thus, the donor’s optimal strategy converges to (5) for
∆ → 0
, which by
definition does not depend on any other details of the history. Note that
D
+
∆
is weakly increasing in
W
,
D
and
G
, and weakly decreasing in
N
and
v
0
v −p
.
D
+
is independent of the period length
∆
, so
the limit as
∆ → 0
is automatically well-defined and has the same properties.
Next, consider the buyer in period
T − ∆
.
Given beliefs given by (7) the probability of success
if
N
buyers have bought before her is given by
π
∆
(D , N , ∆) =



1−F (G −p (N +1))
1−F (D )
if
N + 1 < M (D )
1
otherwise.
.
She buys if and only if
π
∆
(D , N , ∆) ≥
v
0
(∆)
v −p
.
Note that
π
∆
(D , N , ∆)
is increasing in
D
,
N
,
p
,
decreasing in
G
,
and continuous in
D
.
π
∆
is independent
of the period length
∆
,
so the limit
π(D , N , 0)
is automatically well-defined and inherits these properties.
Step 2 (Earlier periods;
u > ∆
): For periods before the deadline,
i.e.,
for
t
< T − ∆
,
we con-
struct the best responses of buyers and the donor in state
(D , N , u )
if
N = M (D ) − j
and construct
π(D , N , u )
,
D (N , u)
, and
ξ
j
(M )
, by induction in
j
. We simultaneously show some basic properties
of of these limiting functions summarized in the following lemma.
These properties are useful for
the comparative statics results in Section 4.3.2.

Lemma 3.
Given
u ∈ (0, T ]
, the following holds:
(i) As long as
π(D , N , u ) ∈ (0, 1)
,
π(D , N , u )
is increasing in
D
,
N
,
T
, and
1
v −p
, and it is decreasing
in
G
. Moreover,
π
is continuous in
D
and
u 7→ π(D , N , u)(v − p ) − v
0
(u )
is strictly increasing.
(ii)
D (N , u)
is decreasing in
N
and decreasing in
u
for
N p < G
. It is increasing in
G
and
1
v −p
.
(iii)
ξ
j
(W )
is decreasing in
j
and increasing in
W
,
G
, and
1
v −p
for
j ≥ 2
.
For the induction step it is useful to also show that
D
+
∆

is weakly increasing in

Since the induction is not in time
t
, it is straightfor-
ward to see that the limit as
∆ → 0
is well defined, so we oftentimes do not write the expressions
for
∆ > 0
but only present the expressions for
∆ → 0
.
I) Suppose
N ≥ M (D )−1
: The buyer always buys and
π
∆
(D , N , u) = 1
for all
u > 0
. The donor
does not donate, i.e.,
D
+
∆
(D , N , u; W ) = D
.
Trivially,
D
+
∆
is weakly increasing in
W
,
D
,
and
G
,
and weakly decreasing in
u
,
N
and
p
.
Let
ξ
1
(W ) ≡ 0
for all
W
, i.e., as long as a buyer arrives before
T
, she will always buy.
Lemma 3
trivially holds.
II) Suppose
N = M (D ) − 2
:
33
From a buyer’s perspective, the project is successful if and only
if either at least one more buyer arrives in the time remaining or the donor donates the rest.
Thus,
given beliefs (7), for
u ∈ T

All donor types want to donate just enough to make a potential buyer in the next period buy, i.e., so
that
π
∆
(D , N , u ) ≥

.
u 7→ π(D , N , u)(v − p ) − v

The rest of Lemma 3 (i) follows immediately.
As

(D , N , u )
as
∆ → 0
is to

donate just enough to assure that the next buyer buys. To this end, define
D
∆
(N , u )
as
π
∆
(D
∆
(N , u ), N , u ) =
v

v − p
,
so that
lim
∆→0
D
∆
(N , u ) = D (N , u )
defined in (3). Thus, the limit of the donor’s optimal strategy is
given by (6).
D (N , u)
is decreasing in
N
because
π
is increasing in both
D
and
N
.
Also,
D (N , u)
is decreasing in
u
because
π(D , N , u)(v − p ) − v
0
(u )
is strictly increasing in
u
and
D
. Finally, note
that
D (N , u)
is increasing in
1
v −p
because
π(D , N , u )
is increasing in
D
, and it is increasing in
G
because
π
is decreasing in
G
,
but increasing in
D
.
Thus,
Lemma 3 (ii) holds.
Therefore,
D
+
is
weakly increasing in
W
,
D
and weakly decreasing in
u
,
N
.
Define
ξ
2
(W )
implicitly by
π(W ,M (W ) − 2,ξ
2
(W ))(v − p ) − v
0
(u ) = 0
for
M (W ) > 2
and
ξ
2
(W ) = 0
otherwise.
Note that locally,
as long as
M (W )
is unchanged,
ξ
2
(W )
is decreasing in
W
.
To see why,
note that
π
is weakly increasing in its first argument,
so locally,
ξ
2
(W )
must be
increasing in
W
. Moreover, since
π
is increasing in
N
,
ξ
2
(W )
is decreasing in
W
even if an increase
in
W
decreases
M (W )
.
This is the case if
M (W ) =
G −W
p
.
Finally, note that
ξ
2
(W )
is increasing in
1
v −p
, i.e., Lemma 3 (iii) holds.
Finally, if there are no more arrivals and the remaining time until the deadline is
ξ
2
(W )
, then
the project is bound to die as
∆ → 0
.
Even if the donor donates up to his full valuation, buyers are
not willing to purchase as
π(W , M (W ), u) = 0
for all
u < ξ

(W )
.

.
Then, given any state
(D , N , u )
where

and

, a buyer

+
(D , M (D )− j +1, s ))−i +1
for
i ≤ j
, i.e., the probability in the integral can be calculated using the induction assumption.
First, it follows immediately that
π
is continuous in
D
.
π(D , N , u )
is locally increasing in
D
,
i.e., for a fixed
M (D )
, because
1
1−F (D )
is increasing in
D
(as
F
0
> 0
),
D
+
is weakly increasing in
D
,
and
π(D , N , u )
is increasing in
D
.
Furthermore,
M (D )
is weakly decreasing in
D
.
Thus,
if
D
is increased to a
D
0
such that
M (D

) < M (D )
, then
π(D
0
, N , u) = π(D

for
i < j
which is by assumption increasing in
D

and
π(D

because

(·)
,
D
+
(·, N + 1, u − s )
is weakly increasing (by assumption),
π(·, N + 1, u − s )
is strictly increasing (by
assumption).
π(D , N , u )
is increasing in
p
,
and decreasing in
G
as
π(D , N + 1, u)
has these properties by
assumption.
Finally,
it follows immediately that
π(D , N , u) < π(D , N + 1, u)
.
Thus Lemma 3 (i)
holds.
The buyer buys if and only if
π(D , N , u) ≥
v
0
(u )
v −p
and because
π(D , N , u )
is increasing in
D
there is a unique
D (N , u)
such that
π(D (N , u ), N , u ) =
v
0
(u )
v −p
.
The donor’s optimal strategy is then
given by (6).
Next, note that for
π(D , N , u) ≥

, we have that

Hence,
there exists

Thus, in equilirbium for

follow analogously to II), i.e., Lemma 3 (ii), (iii) hold.

A.1.2
Proof of Proposition 2
Proof.
(Proposition 2) Consider an arbitrary equilibirum and a realization of
W
. In the last period,
the donor and buyers must play the same strategies as in Proposition 1.
First, note that given any state
(D , N , u )
, buyer beliefs off- and on-path satisfy
1(w ≥ D ) ≥
˜
F (w ; (D , N , u ))
(15)
since after
D
donations have been made, the donor wealth
W
must be at least
D
.
Next, we show that on-path, beliefs must always be a truncation of the prior
F
. In particular, we
need to show that all donor types who can afford it must always donate the same aggregate amount
D
as long as
W ≥ D
. This can be shown by backward induction in time for given
D
and
N
.
Given a belief system
˜
F (w ; (D , N , ∆))
, it is optimal for all donor types to donate just enough to
guarantee that the next buyer buys, i.e., all donor types donate
D
∗
(D , N , ∆) := min
§
D
0
≥ D |1 −
˜
F (M

v
0
v − p
ª
whenever they can so that
D
+
(D , N , ∆) = min

W,D
∗
(D , N , ∆)
.
Thus,
aggregate donations are either
D
∗
(D , N , ∆)
in which case buyer
N + 1
must
truncate her
current belief about
W
at
D
∗
(D , N , T − ∆)
or the buyers must assign probability zero to success of
the project and not buy.
Next, consider
t ∈ T
∆
and assume that in all periods
t
0
> t
the buyer only
truncates beliefs on path in every state
(D , N , T − t
0
)
. Given a belief system
˜
F (w ; (D , N , T − t ))
, let
the probability of success in the continuation game be
π
∆
(D , N , T − t )
, so that it is optimal for all
43
donor types to donate just enough to guarantee that the next buyer buys, i.e., all donor types donate
D
∗
(D , N , T − t ) := min
§
D
0
≥ D |π
∆
(D

v
0
v − p
ª
whenever they can so that
D
+
(D , N , T − t ) = min

W,D
∗
(D , N , T − t )
.
Thus, on path beliefs must be all truncations of
F
and
˜
F (w ; (D , N , u )) ≥
F (w ) − F (D )
1 − F (D )
· 1(w ≥ D ).
All in all,
given those bounds on equilibrium on-path beliefs,
the bounds on donations in part (i)
follows immediately.
It also follows immediately that donations are minimized and at the same time the probability
of success is maximized when on-path beliefs hit the lower bound at any point in time since buyers
still buy as long as
W
exceeds
D
∗
.

A.1.4
Proof of Proposition 3
Proof.
(Proposition 3)
(i) First, note that
Π(G , T )
is decreasing in
G
because by Lemma 3 (iii),
ξ
j
(W )
is increasing in
G
. Next, note that it follows immediately from (9) and (10) that
Π(G , T )
is increasing in
T
because
u
and
ξ
j
(w )
are independent of
T
.
(ii) and (iii) Next,
note that by Lemma 3 (ii)
D (N , T − t )
is decreasing in
T
.
Thus,
for any
realization of arrivals
(τ
j
)
∞
j =1
,
D (N ,T − τ
j
)
is decreasing in
T
, so the realized
D
t
is decreasing in
T
by (11).
Taking expectations over realizations of buyer arrivals
(τ
j
)
∞
j =1
and donor wealth yields
that
E
W ,(τ
j
)
∞
j =1
[D
t
]
is decreasing in
T
since the average of decreasing functions is decreasing.
Similarly, by Lemma 3 (ii),
D (N , T −t )
is increasing in
G
and
v
0
v −p
. Thus, by (11),
E
W ,(τ
j
)
∞
j =1
[D

]
is increasing in
G
and
v
0
v −p
.
(iv) Let
u > 0
and
N < M

D (N , u) > G − N p
, then
1 >
v
0
v − p
= π(D (N , u), N , u) > π(G − N p , N , u) = 1.
and since
π
is continuous in
D
by Lemma 3 (i),
it can never be optimal for the donor to donate
G − N p
.

A.1.5
Proof of Proposition 4
Proof.
(Proposition 4)
i)
Donations at the start of the campaign only:
Consider the setting where donations are allowed only at the start of the campaign, and con-
sider a realization of buyer arrivals and donor value
W
that leads to a success.
We show that
this event is also a success in any equilibrium of the game that allows continuous donations,
i.e., it belongs to
S (G , T )
.
45
Let
D
0
denote the optimal donation made at the start of the campaign and by assumption the
probability of success with that donation is positive.
If continuous donations were allowed,
the donor could replicate the strategy of donating
D
0
at the start.
This after
N
arrivals
u
periods form the deadline the probability of success is given by
π(D
0
, N , u) ≥ π
no
(N , u ) ≥
v
0
v − p
given the equilibrium beliefs, where
π
no
(N , u )
denotes the probability of success of a game
absent donations with goal
G −D
0
. The inequality follows from the fact that a current donation
D
0
implies that
W ≥ D
0
in any equilibrium in the main model by Proposition 2, while absent
further donations it is assumed that
W = D
0
.
Consequently,
this strategy would lead to a
success even when continuous donations are allowed.
The donor’s optimal strategy must,
therefore,
also lead to a success in any PBE of the model with continuous donations,
i.e.,
Π(G , T ) ≥ Π
0
(G , T )
for all
G , T > 0
.
Furthermore, note that
D
0
< W
for any realization of
W
,
because donating all
W
gives the donor a payoff of zero while lowering it
gives him
a positive expected payoff.
Thus,
there is always a realization of arrivals that
leads to a
success with continuous donations, but not in the counterfactual, i.e.,
Π(G , T ) > Π
0
(G , T )
for
all
G , T > 0
.
In all
such events,
the donor is strictly better off when continuous donations are allowed
because he can induce a success with lower donations.
For all other events, a success in the
model with continuous donations must make him better off than no success.
Next, consider a realization of buyer arrivals. There are two cases: First, if a particular buyer
bought in the setting in which donations are allowed only at the start, then she must also buy
if donations are allowed throughout.
For all such realizations,
the probability of success is
strictly higher if donations were allowed throughout, making the buyer strictly better off.
Second, if a buyer did not buy in the setting with donations allowed only at the start, then
•
she buys if donations are allowed throughout if and only if
W ≥ D
∗
(D , N , u )
(where
D
∗
(D , N , u) = max{D , D (N , u)}
in the platform optimal equilibrium and
D
∗
(D , N , u ) =
max{D , D (N , u)}
in the platform optimal equilibrium) and
46
•
she does not buy if and only if
W < D
∗
(D , N , u )
.
Thus, this buyer is better off in expectation upon arrival.
ii)
Donations at the deadline only:
Next consider a realization of buyer arrivals
τ
i
and donor value
W
that leads to a success in
the setting where donations are allowed only at the end of the campaign. We show that this is
event is in
S (G , T )
for any PBE.
Buyers believe that
W ∼ F
throughout. (Their beliefs cannot be updated upward as in the case
of continuous donations.) Thus, for this realization of arrivals, in a setting where continuous
donations were allowed,
buyers would buy even absent donations.
Therefore,
the optimal
strategy of the donor would be to not donate until the deadline is reached.
At the same time
if there are few arrivals early on, the donor can induce a success with countinuous donations
given an equilibrium belief system, but the campaign would die if donations are only allowed
at the deadline. Thus,
Π(G , T ) > Π
T
(G , T )
.
For all such realizations which end in success in a setting with donations only at
T
, the donor
is indifferent between the model with continuous donations and the counterfactual, since he
chooses the same strategy.
Further,
a success in the model with continuous donations must
make him better off (and for some realizations when
D
T
< W
strictly better off) than no
success.
Next, consider a realization of buyer arrivals.
If a particular buyer bought in the setting with
donations allowed only at
T
, then she must also buy if donations are allowed throughout. For
all those realizations, the probability of success is higher if donations were allowed through-
out, making the buyer strictly better off. If a buyer did not buy in the counterfactual, then
•
she buys if donations are allowed throughout if and only if
W ≥ D
∗
(D , N , u )
and
•
she does not buy if and only if
W < D
∗
(D , N , u )
.
Thus, this buyer is better off in expectation upon arrival.

Step 2 (Earlier periods;
u > 0
): For periods before the deadline, i.e., for
u > 0
, we construct the
best responses of buyers and the donor by induction in
j
, given that
D
donations have been made
and
N = M (D ) − j
.
I) Suppose
N ≥ M (D ) − 1
:
A buyer with
s = 1
buys if and only if
µ
1
t
≥
v
0
+p
v
and
β
1
(X
t
) =
β
0
(X
t
) = 1
. Trivially,
D
+
is weakly increasing in
W
,
D
, and
G
, and weakly decreasing in
u
,
N
and
p
.
Let
ξ
1
(W ) ≡ 0
for all
W
, i.e., as long as a buyer arrives before
T
, she will always buy.
Lemma
3 (i) and (iv) trivially holds. Note that the project actually succeeds if and only if
µ
q
t
≥
v
0
+p
v
.
Define
¯
µ
1
to be such that
¯
µ
1
¯
µ
1
+ (1 −
¯
µ
1
)α
=
v
0
+ p
v
i.e.,
¯
µ
1
=
(v
0
+p )(1−α)
(v −(v
0
+p ))α−(v
0
+p )(1−α)
.
Thus for
µ
t
<
¯
µ
1
no future buyer will buy and for
µ
t
≥
¯
µ
1
only
buyers with
s = 1
buy.
This fully characterizes the buyers’ strategies if
N ≥ M (D ) − 1
.
Public
beliefs remain unchanged if
µ ∈ [0,
¯
µ
1
)
and they evolve (in the limit
∆ → 0
) according to (12) in
µ
t
≥
¯
µ
1
.
II) Suppose
N = M (D ) − 2
:
34
We assume that after an off-equilibrium purchase,
the market
always believes the buyer has seen
q = 1
.
Let the current public belief be
µ
t
.
We need to define
regions of beliefs in which no buyer buys (case 1) or only buyers with
s = 1
buy (case 2). Note that
independently of whether in equilibrium buyers with
s = 1
buy or not, the updating after a purchase
is the same assuming that after an unexpected purchase buyers conclude that that buyer observed
s = 1
.
However, absent a purchase, beliefs stay constant in case 1 and decrease in case 2.
Thus, a
buyer’s problem whether to purchase or not is the same in case 1 and 2.
As in the benchmark model, from a buyer’s perspective, the project is successful if and only if
either at least one more buyer arrives and buys in the time remaining or if the donor donates the rest.
If
µ
1
t
<
¯
µ
1
, the probability of success if the buyer buys is given by
β
1
(X
t
) = β
0
(X
t
) =
1 − F (G − p (N + 1))
1 − F (D )
for
D ≤ G − p (N + 1)
.
Note that the donor never wants to donate more than
G − p (N + 1)
.
Thus,
34
This step is redundant
for the proof of Proposition 1,
but
necessary for Lemma 3 and useful
for the proofs of
Subsection 4.3.2.

Thus, the donor’s best response if

is to donate

If

, then before the next arrival occurs the belief drops according to (12) until it hits
¯
µ

at

. The probability of success is hence given by

Note that both functions are increasing in

. It is optimal for any buyer to not buy if and only if

· β
1
(X
t
) − p · (1 − µ

(X

.
which is the case if
D
is not large enough.
Note that
B (X
t
)
is increasing in
D
and for any
µ
1
t
>
¯
µ
1
there exists a
D ≤ G − p (N + 1)
such that
the above inequality is violated,
i.e.,
the buyer will
purchase.
Then as
∆ → 0
it is optimal to donate just enough to make the next buyer with
s = 1
indifferent
between buying and not buying absent additional donations.
Then,
the donor’s limiting optimal
strategy can be written as
D
+
(D , N , u , µ
t
) = max{D , min{D (N , u, µ
t
), W }}.

Let us define

to be the time by which the next buyer must arrive for the project to stay
alive, given donor wealth

.
Further, if the donor runs out of funds in the sense that
µ >

and
B (D , N , u, µ) < v

, the project
dies forever.
i.e., we show that for

III) For the induction step assume that for each

and
i = 2 . . . j − 1

β

,
Ω(D , M (D ) − i , u , µ)

where

(W , µ)
is the time before which the next buyer must arrive for the project to stay alive,
given donor wealth realization
W
, public belief

and that
i + 1
buyers are still needed.
Given any state
X
t
where
N = M (D ) − j
and
u ≥ T − γ
j −1
(D , µ

, first consider
µ <

case, no buyer buys, and the probability of success is given by.

The probability in the integral can be calculated using the induction assumption.
The buyer given
X

buys if and only if

Note that
B (X

is increasing in

and for any
µ

there exists a
D ≤ G − p (N + 1)
such
that the above inequality is violated, i.e., the buyer will purchase.
Then as
∆ → 0
it is optimal to
donate just enough to make the next buyer with
s = 1
indifferent between buying and not buying
absent additional donations and the donor’s limiting optimal strategy is given by (16).
Finally, we can define
γ

the project to stay alive, given donor wealth
