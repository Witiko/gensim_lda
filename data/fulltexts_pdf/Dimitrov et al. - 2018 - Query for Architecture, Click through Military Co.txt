ABSTRACT
As one of the richest sources of encyclopedic information on the
Web, Wikipedia generates an enormous amount of traffic. In this
paper, we study large-scale article access data of the English Wi-
kipedia in order to compare articles with respect to the two main
paradigms of information seeking,
i.e.,
search by formulating a
query,
and navigation by following hyperlinks.
To this end,
we
propose and employ two main metrics, namely (i) searchshare –
the relative amount of views an article received by search –, and
(ii) resistance – the ability of an article to relay traffic to other
Wikipedia articles – to characterize articles. We demonstrate how
articles in distinct topical categories differ substantially in terms of
these properties. For example, architecture-related articles are often
accessed through search and are simultaneously a “dead end” for
traffic, whereas historical articles about military events are mainly
navigated. We further link traffic differences to varying network,
content, and editing activity features. Lastly, we measure the impact
of the article properties by modeling access behavior on articles
with a gradient boosting approach. The results of this paper con-
stitute a step towards understanding human information seeking
behavior on the Web.

INTRODUCTION
Before the age of the World Wide Web [
1
], information was pre-
dominantly consumed in a linear way,
e.g.,
starting at the first
page of a book and following the laid out narrative until the end.
With the introduction of hypertext [
22
] in digital environments, the
way people consume information changed dramatically [
4
,
18
–
20
].
While on early websites, users still predominantly visited a main
page through a fixed address and were sometimes even bounded
by a more directory-like navigation structure, the rise of search en-
gines and tighter interlinking of websites have corroded the linear
consumption paradigm even further. Today, users access a single
website through a multitude of webpages as entry points and can
usually choose from numerous paths through the available linked
content at any time. In such a setting, understanding at which (kind
of) pages users typically begin and end their journey on a given
website, vs. which pages relay traffic internally from and to these
points, provides several useful insights. On one hand, it has high
practical importance since it provides the first and last contact
opportunity; pages could be shaped to leverage their function as
an entry point (e.g., by prioritizing improvements of navigational
guidance for these pages to retain visitors), or as an exit point (e.g.,
by surveying visitors for their user experience before leaving, or
by providing increased incentives to continue navigation). On the
other hand, knowledge about entry, relay and exit points is also
closely tied to the relation of the major information seeking strate-
gies, i.e., search and navigation: the first page visited in a session
on a website is frequently reached via search engine results, after a
query formulation, while navigation has been often used when the
exact information need cannot be easily expressed in words [
9
,
10
].
Understanding under which circumstances search or navigation
dominate the users’ information seeking behavior can help in devel-
oping an agenda for improving the web content in order to optimize
visitor rates and retention.
Scope and research questions.
Information consumption on the
Web has been of special interest to researchers since the Web’s
earliest days [
13
,
14
].
While both search [
21
,
32
,
34
] and naviga-
tion [
7
,
11
,
15
–
17
] have been investigated thoroughly in related
work,
they were mostly looked at separately.
Consequently,
so
far little is known about which parts and content types of a spe-
cific website (inter)act in which structural roles, begetting different
information access patterns.

D. Dimitrov et al.
In this work,
we analyze how these patterns manifest on the
online encyclopedia Wikipedia. With more than 5 million articles,
Wikipedia is one of the primary information sources for many
Web users and through its openly available pageview data provides
an essential use case for studying information seeking behavior,
as made apparent by numerous studies [
6
,
16
,
24
].
Yet,
there is
a lack of understanding how search and navigation as the two
major information access forms in combination shape the traffic
of large-scale hypertext environments, such as the world’s largest
online encyclopedia. To this end, we are interested in answering
the following research questions: (i) How do search and navigation
interplay to shape the article traffic on Wikipedia? Given an article,
we want to know how its acting as a search entry point is related to
(not) relaying navigation traffic into Wikipedia, and vice versa. This
also addresses the issue of how search and navigation contribute to
the article’s popularity. Beyond these characteristics of the system
in general, we also examine which specific properties of articles
influence their roles in the search-vs-navigation ecosystem.
We
hence ask: (ii) Which article features (i.e., topic, network, content
and edit features) are indicative for specific information access
behavior?
Materials,
approach and methods.
Building our analysis on
large-scale,
openly available log data for the English edition of
Wikipedia, we propose two metrics capturing individual traffic be-
havior on articles,
i.e.,
(i) searchshare – the amount of views an
article received by search –, and (ii) resistance – the ability of an
article to channel traffic into and through Wikipedia (cf. Section 2).
We use searchshare and resistance to first explore the relation
between search and navigation and their effect on the popularity of
articles independent of their content (cf. Section 3). Depending on
these two measures, we assign articles to four groups describing the
role they assume for attracting and retaining visitors. Subsequently,
we characterize the influence of several article attributes, including
the general topical domain, edit activity and content structure on
the preferred information access form (cf. Section 4). Finally, we fit
a gradient boosting model to determine the impact of these article
features on the preferred user access behavior (cf. Section 5).
Contributions and findings.
Our contributions are the following:
(i) Regarding the general (collective) access behavior on Wikipedia,
we provide empirical evidence that for the most viewed articles
search dominates navigation in the number of articles accessed and
received views. For the tail of the view distributions, navigation
appears to become more and more important. (ii) We link article
properties, i.e., position in the Wikipedia network, number of article
revisions,
and topic to preferred access behavior,
i.e.,
search or
navigation. Finally, (iii) we quantify the strength of the relationship
between article properties and preferred access behavior.
Our analysis suggests that (i) while search and navigation are
used to access and explore different articles, both types of infor-
mation access are crucial for Wikipedia, and (ii) that exit points of
navigation sessions are located at the periphery of the link network,
whereas entry points are located at the core. (iii) Edit activity is
strongly related with the ability of an article to relay traffic, and
thus with the preferred access behavior.
Our results may have a variety of applications, e.g., improving
and maintaining the visual appearance and hyperlink structure of
articles, identifying articles exhibiting changes in access behavior
patterns due to vandalism or other online misbehavior. We consider
our analysis as an initial step to better understand how search and
navigation interplay to shape the user access behavior on platforms
like Wikipedia and on websites in general.

TRANSITION DATA AND DEFINITIONS
Below, we give an overview of the used dataset capturing the traffic
on Wikipedia articles and define searchshare and resistance as our
main metrics for describing the individual article traffic behavior.
2.1
Transition Data
For studying the access behavior on Wikipedia articles, we use the
clickstream dataset published by the Wikimedia Foundation [
38
].
The used dataset contains the transition counts between webpages
and Wikipedia articles in form of (referrer, resource) pairs extracted
from the server logs for August, 2016, and is limited to pairs that
occur at least 10 times. The referrer pages are either external (e.g.,
search engines, social media), internal (other Wikipedia pages), or
missing (e.g., if the article is accessed directly using the browser
address bar).
The navigation targets are purely internal pages.
1
Since we are interested in contrasting Wikipedia article access
from search engines and navigation (see also our discussion in
Section 7),
we focus our analyses only on those articles in the
clickstream dataset that have received views through search or
internal navigation, setting aside remaining view sources (mostly
"no referrer"). Accordingly, we define total views of an article as the
sum of all page accesses by either search or navigation.
The resulting dataset consists of 2,830,709 articles accessed through
search 2,805,238,298 times and 14,405,839 transitions originating
from 1,370,456 articles and accounting for 1,251,341,103 views of
2,149,104 target articles. In total, the dataset consists of 3,104,702 ar-
ticles viewed 4,056,579,401 times, with a ratio of 69% stemming from
search and 31% from internal navigation – in line with previous
reports on the clickstream data [7, 15].
2.2
Definitions
To achieve a fundamental understanding of the parts that search
and navigation each play for the distribution of views in Wikipedia,
we take a look at the functional roles articles can assume for the
overall traffic flow in respect to their searchshare and resistance.
Searchshare.
A high searchshare value indicates that search is the
predominant paradigm of accessing an article, and thus that the
article acts as an entry point for a site visit. In contrast, articles with
a low value receive most of their views from users visiting them by
means of navigation. The searchshare metric is defined as
searchshare(a) =
in
s e
(a)
in
s e
(a) + in
nav
(a)
(1)
where
in
s e
(a)
is the number of pageviews an article
a
received
directly from search engine referrers, and
in
nav
(a)
is the number
of views from navigation as recorded in the Wikipedia clickstream.
Resistance.
A low resistance value signals that an article forwards
most of its received traffic to other articles within Wikipedia, hence

Leaving a Wikipedia page is treated as the end of the visit in the logs, whether by
clicking on an external link or closing the page.

Figure 1: Ranking overlap. Four rankings are shown, accord-

pageviews coming from search (in

and out-navigation (out
nav
).
The y-axis indicates overlaps
between pairs of rankings,
considering the top-k articles
of each ranking as marked on the x-axis (log-scaled,
top
articles on the left).
As a result,
the overall ranking of to-
tal pageviews shows a very high overlap with the incoming
search ranking. The top pages by search and navigation dif-
fer substantially. Notably, being a distribution point of traf-
fic (high out

does not block the flow of incoming traffic onward. A high value in
turn indicates that an article acts as an exit point. Thus, it rarely re-
lays users to other Wikipedia articles. These articles are traffic sinks
in the Wikipedia information network. We define the resistance
metric as
resistance(a) = 1 −

(a)
(2)
where
out

(a)
is the number of pageviews that had article

[0,1]. This is necessary since a small number of articles generates
more out-going traffic than they receive pageviews, e.g., due to a
user opening several links in a new tab each.

GENERAL ACCESS BEHAVIOR
In this section,
we investigate how exogenous and endogenous
traffic contribute to article popularity on Wikipedia, and we study
the distribution of traffic features. We provide a first overview of
the general access behavior on Wikipedia regarding search and
navigation,
aided by a division of articles into four groups with
respect to searchshare and resistance; in Section 4, we will subse-
quently take a deeper look at dissimilarities between different types
of articles.
Search and navigation in relation to total views.
As can be
expected from related research on Wikipedia and similar online
platforms, the distribution of pageviews over articles is long-tailed
with a heavy skew towards the head (80% views generated by the
top-visited 5.2% of all articles). To better investigate the relationship
between search and (incoming and outgoing) navigation on the ar-
ticles popularity, we calculate the cumulative overlap (intersection)

Figure 2: Articles and article views by access behavior.
For
a given searchshare (y-axis) and resistance (x-axis), the fig-
ure shows (a) the number of articles and (b) the sum of their
views in each heatmap square bin. Warm colors denote high
values,
using a logarithmic scale.
We observe that search
dominates navigation in terms of number of accessed arti-
cles (note the single top data bin in (a)) and that a substantial
amount of articles exhibits high resistance values. When fo-
cusing on views, we see a more spread-out pattern, evidenc-
ing that a relatively small amount of articles attracts a sub-
stantial amount of search views and channels them onward
to other articles (upper left side of (b)), corresponding to the
search-relay group (cf. Table 1).
of the descendingly ranked articles at each rank k, divided by k;
this is an adaptation of the Rank Biased Overlap
2
measure.
Figure 1(a) shows that the top k articles ordered by search traffic
(top-k-search) are highly overlapping with the top articles by total
views (top-k-total) at any k, underscoring the general importance
of search as a driver of incoming views. In-navigation, in contrast,
is not a deciding factor to belong to the top most visited pages,
but sees an extreme increase in the influence on overall views for
articles up to top-k-total around 8000, at which point the increase
continues,
but levels off.
Apparently,
while search is the overall
main driver for traffic, in-navigation rapidly becomes a more cen-
tral source of traffic beyond the extremely popular articles. Turning
to navigation passed on from articles to other articles, we can glean
from Figure 1(a) that (i) while the very top of viewed articles con-
tribute little in relation to their accumulated views to the internal
traffic flow of Wikipedia (low overlap for
out
nav
&
total
), we (ii) see
a rapid and constant drop in the amount of traffic “dying” at a given
page with increasing top-k-total.
Further, while it is not surprising that the outgoing traffic accu-
mulates generally in line with the overall received views, up until
around top-k-total 1,500,000 it is generated at a rate surpassing the
relative increase of total views, with the highest ranks of top-k-total
contributing comparably little to it, just as to in-navigation. These
observations are in line with Figure 1(b), where we see that a higher
rank in receiving navigation - rather than from search - is more
strongly correlated with distributing views to other articles for the

Rank Biased Overlap [
35
] is a common metric for similarity between rankings using
cumulative set overlap in cases where the two lists do not necessarily share the same
elements (as is the case here). Top-weighting as can be specified for RBO is neither
suited nor necessary for the distinction of different k that we aim for here.

largest portion of pages, after top-k-total 3000; up until that point,
the largest share of channeled traffic stems from search views. As
bottom line, we see a pattern that points to a small number of pages
at the extreme top of the pageview counts that are mostly searched,
but in relation to their popularity rather isolated in terms of nav-
igation; with in- and out-navigation similarly gaining notably in
correlation with overall views for lower top-k-total ranks.
Traffic feature distributions.
Figure 3 depicts the system-wide
distribution of searchshare and resistance. Pages are generally much
more searched than navigated to (searchshare median = 0.74, mean
= 0.66) as seen in Figure 3(a). It is also apparent from Figure 3(b)
that most articles do not tend to forward much of their received
traffic internally, with the median for resistance for all articles lying
at 1.0 and the mean at 0.88. This general tendency prevails when
these scores are weighted by their received views (Figures 3(c)
and 3(d)), but a notably less skewed distribution emerges, implying
that – even when accounting for regression-to-the-mean effects –
a majority of views is acquired via search and that a majority of
views hits rather high-resistance targets.
Relation between searchshare and resistance.
We observe a
light positive correlation (pearson = 0.26, spearman = 0.33) indicat-
ing that the more likely an article is used to start a session, the more
likely it is also to be the last article accessed in a session. Figure 2
depicts this association for all articles in our dataset.
To explore this relation further, we assign each article to one of
four groups, determined by the mean of both searchshare and resis-
tance as the thresholds.
3
We label each group according to its traffic
behavior, i.e., (i) search-relay articles that are often searched while
simultaneously contributing to further navigation (above-mean
searchshare, below-mean resistance); (ii) search-exit articles with
above-average searchshare that are often accessed from search but
do not lead to users navigating further (above-mean searchshare,

A delimitation by median yields groups with the sole resistance value 1.0 and was
therefore not used. Cut-offs at 0.5 would have created extremely unbalanced groups.
Table 1: Article group sizes and views. For each group, the ta-
ble shows the percentage of articles and their received views.
The majority of the articles are less visited and act as exit
points of user session, whereas only popular articles are able
to further relay traffic.

above-mean resistance); (iii) navigation-exit articles that receive
their traffic mostly from navigation but cannot channel traffic to
other pages (below-mean searchshare, above-mean resistance); (iv)
navigation-relay articles that are mainly accessed from within Wiki-
pedia and able to pass traffic on internally (below-mean searchshare,
below-mean resistance). Table 1 reports the share of articles and
views pertaining to each group. We observe that a small group of
highly visited articles is able to inject considerable amounts of traf-
fic (search-relay) into Wikipedia while about a fifth of the articles’
role is mainly to channel traffic internally (nav.-relay). On the other
hand, exit points receive less views while covering a much bigger
portion of Wikipedia articles.
Overall,
these observations are in
line with Figure 3.
Summary.
Our analysis shows that search dominates navigation
with respect to the number of articles accessed and visit frequency.
However, the less viewed an article is, the more significant naviga-
tion becomes as an information access form. Further, only popular
articles are able to relay traffic while the majority of the articles
acts as exit points for user search and navigation sessions.

CHARACTERIZING ACCESS BEHAVIOR
In the previous section, we analyzed the general Wikipedia infor-
mation access behavior,
setting aside individual page attributes.
However,
Wikipedia articles have different properties that may
influence the way they are retrieved (cf. Section 4.1). To this end,
we analyze the general Wikipedia access behavior dependent on
the article network (cf. Section 4.2), and content and edit properties
(cf. Section 4.3). Subsequently, we highlight differences between
general access behavior on Wikipedia and on Wikipedia topics
dominated by search and navigation, respectively (cf. Section 4.4).
4.1
Wikipedia Article Data and Features
To study the influence of the content on the preferred access be-
havior, we focus on a snapshot of all Wikipedia articles contained
in the main namespace of the English language version from Au-
gust, 2016
4
. We obtained the articles using the Wikipedia API
5
. The
collected article data represent the HTML version of each article
on which the transitions data used to study the Wikipedia traffic
has been generated (cf. Section 2.1). By parsing and rendering the
HTML version of the articles, we are able to extract article features

capturing aspects related to the content of the articles. The dataset
contains roughly 5 million articles connected by 391 million links.
For these Wikipedia articles, we determine a wide variety of fea-
tures describing their characteristics. We categorize these features
into three different groups, i.e., (i) network properties, (ii) content
and edit properties and (iii) article topics.
The network features
consist of in-, out- and total degree of the article in the Wikipedia
link network as well as the k-core value for this network as a typi-
cal centrality measure. Regarding the content and edit properties,
we calculated for each article the number of sections, the number
of figures and the number of lists contained in the article.
These
features capture visual appearance of the article, whereas the num-
ber of revisions and editors represent content production process.
We also consider the article age measured in years to account for
differences between mature and young articles. To account for the
amount of information provided in an article, we calculate its size
in kilobytes.
The features capturing the content production pro-
cess are extracted from the TokTrack dataset [
8
] and consider the
period between article creation and the end of August 2016.
As
the Wikipedia article categories are often too specific
6
,
we fit a
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [
2
] model on article texts using
Gensim [
27
] bag of words article vectors with removed stop words.
To allow for manual interpretation of the topics, we fit a model for
20 topics. Subsequently, we asked five independent researchers to
provide topic labels based on the top words and Wikipedia articles
for each topic and summarized their labels. Section 4.4 describes
the extracted topics. The following analyses are based on a random
sample of 50000 articles.
4.2
Network Features
To understand the role of the network features, we compute the
median of the features for each of the four article groups search-exit,
search-relay, nav.-relay, and nav.-exit (cf. Section 3). The results are
shown in Table 2. We can observe that articles with below-average

I.e., very specific categories of articles are not linked to the relevant super-category;
in other cases, two conflicting categories are linked or fitting categories are missing
completely.
searchshare and resistance (article group nav.-relay) have higher
median values across all network features,
i.e.,
they are located
more in the center of the network and consistently have more
incoming and outgoing links. Although search-relay articles are not
as well connected as nav.-relay, their relatively central position in
the network and high number of outgoing connections is important
in order to inject traffic into Wikipedia. By contrast, articles that are
often used as exit points (search-exit and nav.-exit) are located more
in the periphery of the network (low k-core value), are less often
linked to, and contain less out-links themselves, which eventually
results in higher resistance values, signifying the termination of
user sessions.
For further analysis, we sort the articles according to their k-core
value and discretize them into 25 equally-sized bins. For each bin,
we compute the quartiles for searchshare and resistance, as seen
in Figure 4. Looking at the median (center red line), we find that
for articles with increasing k-core values the searchshare indeed
decreases (cf. Figure 4(a)). However, this effect stops at around 50%
of the dataset,
i.e.,
for half of the articles,
which are located in
high k-core network layers, the searchshare is mostly independent
from the exact centrality. Regarding the resistance, there exists a
substantial amount of nodes with a resistance of 1.0 for all k-core
values, cf. the green line indicating the upper quartile. However,
for the more central nodes, an increased number of pages have a
significantly lower resistance (cf. Figure 4(b)).
4.3
Content and Edit Features
Next, we characterize the article groups in terms of the article con-
tent and edit history which account for the content presentation
and content production process. Table 3 reports the median values
of these features in the four article groups. We can observe that the
content features (number of tables, number of sections, size of the
article) are modestly increased for relay articles, i.e., articles that
contain more content tend to be less often exit points of navigation
sessions. By contrast, the revision history plays a more important
role: we can see that articles in the search-relay group have (as a
median) more than twice the number of editors and revisions com-
pared to exit articles, and tend also to be somewhat older. Articles
in the group nav.-relay show similar, but slightly lower values with
the same tendency. The median feature values for both “exit” article
Table 2: Network features. For each network feature, the ta-
ble shows the median feature values of the articles in the re-
spective group. The article network properties influence the
preferred access behavior. Nav.-relay articles act as intersec-
tions for the traffic as they occupy central network positions
and provide lots of in- and outgoing links. Search-relay ar-
ticles are similarly well-connected,
which is important for
injecting traffic into Wikipedia. Exit points (search-exit and
nav.-exit articles) lack connectivity and are unable to chan-
nel external and internal traffic, respectively.

dicated by the number of revisions. Revisions values are di-

the other hand has a positive effect on navigation indicated
by the lower searchshare.
groups are very similar and show slightly lower editor and revision
numbers. Overall, content and edit features provide strong indica-
tors for articles relaying traffic (as opposed to being exit points), but
only weak indicators for being accessed by search or by navigation.
We will have a more detailed look at an exemplary edit feature,
i.e., the number of revisions. Analogously to above (network fea-
tures), we assign the articles to one of 25 bins according to their
revision count, compute the distribution of searchshare and resis-
tance for each bin, and plot the quartiles. The results are shown
in Figure 5. We can see that the median searchshare continuously
decreases with increasing number of revisions. The effect is in par-
ticular significant for very low number of revisions (cf. Figure 5(a)).
Additionally, the spread of the distribution – measured by the in-
terquartile range (IQR) – also substantially decreases the more
revisions an article has. This can likely be explained by regression to
the mean since articles with less revisions receive overall less views,
making more extreme searchshare values more likely. With regard
to the resistance, we can observe that specifically high number of
revisions correlate with a lower resistance scores (cf. Figure 5(b)).
The number of editors, and the age of an article is highly correlated
with the number of revisions and reveal a very similar behavior
with respect to searchshare and resistance.
Table 3: Content and edit features. For each content and edit
feature, the table shows the median feature values of the ar-
ticles in the respective group.
The content production pro-
cess influences the access behavior as search- and nav.-exit
points have low edit activity, and offer less content. On the
other hand,
relay articles are more frequently edited,
and
congruently, are generally more extensive.

Topic Features
Search-related popularity, navigability as well as other character-
istics related to traffic might be highly dependent on the topical
domain of an article.
We hence investigate the access behavior
across Wikipedia’s numerous article themes, represented by the 20
topics we have extracted. Table 4 provides descriptive statistics of
these topics. With 32% “TV and Movies” is the topic with the most
views while consisting of a mere 7.5% of all articles on Wikipedia.
“Technology, Stubs” and “Architecture” show an opposing dynamic,

articles and views for each topic. Additionally, it reports the
median age in years,

and
the size of the articles in kB. Not surprisingly, popular arti-
cles are generally longer in terms of text, edited more and
by higher number of editors, and relatively old.

the number of revisions. Articles are divided into 25 bins by k-core and revision values. Apart from base-level differences of

much by network position or edit activity features for “Military” articles.
providing a large amount of articles,
but relatively few views.

Overall, the amounts of articles and view counts are not strongly
correlated. Consistent with previous research, we also observe that
the popular articles are in general longer, relative old, and revised
more often by more editors [32].
A look at the distribution of searchshare and resistance in the
overview provided by Figure 6 reveals the different access behav-
iors for Wikipedia topics. To examine these pronounced differences
further,
we set out to highlight the dissimilarities of the overall
searchshare vs. resistance distribution for total views – as shown

in Figure 2(b) – with the same distribution for the individual topics.
To do so, we create heatmaps pinpointing the relative differences
of each topic to the baseline of the overall distribution.
This is
achieved by performing a bin-wise division of a topic’s normal-
ized view count for a given searchshare-resistance bin with the
respective normalized bin for the general Wikipedia traffic behavior.
The resulting heatmaps are shown in Figure 7 for selected topics.
They draw a clear picture of the over- and under-representation
of certain article types (in terms of views) in each topic against
the whole-system baseline.
“Architecture” in Figure 7 stands as
one representative for a group of topics (“Biology”,
“Industry &
Chemistry”, Research & Education, “Space & Racing”) that all ex-
hibit a very similar distribution with their article views occurring

at high searchshare and high resistance, i.e., these topics are mostly
searched and not used for further navigation.
In stark contrast,
views for “Military” topics occur to the largest part in comparably
low-resistance articles, that are mostly navigated to (views for “UK
& Commonwealth” are distributed almost analogously). “Sports”
reveals a similar inclination for nav-relay types of articles attracting
views,
yet sports articles also frequently get accessed by search
and abandoned immediately (closely related patterns: “Fine Arts
& Culture” and “Politics”). Lastly, “Music” and “TV & Movies” ex-
hibit remarkably idiosyncratic distribution patterns, not mirrored
by another topic.
“Music” attracts many views in a search-relay
fashion, but on the other hand also explicitly acts as a “dead end”
for internal navigation.
As “maximally different” topics in respect to these traffic pat-
terns and with overall high view counts, we select “Architecture”
for search-heavy topics, and “Military” for navigation-heavy topics
to conduct a deeper analysis regarding article network, content and
edit properties. While “Architecture” includes articles covering pop-
ular buildings, landmarks and municipalities, “Military” consists of
articles covering significant historic events often associated with
violence such as wars and notable battles, along with many articles
dedicated to military units, personnel and equipment (cf. [
28
]). For
the general access behavior concerning the network, content and
edit features, we again assign the articles to one of 25 bins accord-
ing to their k-core and revision counts, compute the distribution of
searchshare and resistance for each bin, and plot the quartiles (cf.
Figure 8). For “Architecture”, searchshare (a) initially decreases for
increasing k-core but sees an uptick for very central nodes, and a
very similar behavior can be observed for resistance (b). “Military”
is characterized by generally lower levels of both metrics, yet shares
the trend of decreasing resistance with increasing k-core (e), mean-
ing that for both topics, the more central articles in the network are
able to channel visitors into Wikipedia, with the top-most central
nodes excluded from this trend. Being edited more implies decreas-
ing resistance for both topics ((d), (h)), although this trend reveals
itself only for much higher revision counts for “Architecture”, most
likely to its generally higher resistance. Edit counts have no clearly
distinguishable influence on “Military” articles’ searchshare,
for
“Architecture” it, however, implies lower searchshare.
Summary.
The results presented in this section suggest that the
content heavily influences the access behavior on Wikipedia. Par-
ticularly, topical domains are accessed differently, i.e., users prefer
to access articles about architecture and landmarks mainly through
search, whereas more historical articles about military actions are
navigated. Moreover, mature articles with high revision numbers
and article located in the core of the network are more likely to
channel traffic through Wikipedia, whereas articles located at the
network periphery act as exit points.

MODELING ACCESS BEHAVIOR
Our previous analysis characterized the user access behavior on
Wikipedia articles with respect to their traffic from search and
navigation dependent on the article features. However, this analysis
does not reveal
the impact of the feature groups on the access
behavior. To this end, we set out to model the access behavior on
articles in order to measure the influence of each feature group. The

Predict-

higher the predicative performance of a feature group, the higher
the influence of the group is on the role articles play with respect to
the traffic (entry-exit and relay articles), and thus on the preferred
information access form (search and navigation).
Modeling searchshare.
We ask, given a Wikipedia article, if it is
possible to classify it as dominated by search, i.e.,
searchshare >
0
.
66 or dominated by navigation,
i.e.,
searchshare
≤
0
.
66.
The
threshold used for the separation is the searchshare mean (cf. Sec-
tion 3). In our experiments, we consider four different sets of article
features: (i) network features, i.e., in-, out-degree, k-core, (ii) content
& edit features, i.e., number of revisions and editors, article size,
number of tables, pictures, lists, and (iii) topic. For predicting the
preferred access form, we fit a model using gradient boosting and
evaluate the model’s performance with ROC AUC. The model is
trained using 10-fold cross validation at a balanced dataset. On this
dataset random guessing results in 50% accuracy, which is also used
as baseline. Figure 9(a) shows the individual performance for each
feature group, as well as the performance for the combination of
all features. We observe that modeling searchshare is difficult even
with all features (AUC = 0.70). As expected, the network features are
the least indicative (AUC = 0.58). Further, the topic feature predicts
searchshare best (AUC = 0.64), which suggests strong user prefer-
ences for specific information access form, i.e., search or navigation
for different topics.
Modeling resistance.
To model the resistance of Wikipedia arti-
cles, i.e., they ability to relay traffic, we treat an article as a relay
point if
resistance ≤
0
.
88 and an exit point if
resistance >
0
.
88.
Again, the separation of the articles is based on the resistance mean
(cf.
Section 3).
We consider the same feature groups as for mod-
eling searchshare and use random guessing as our baseline.
For
classifying the articles, we again utilize 10-fold cross validation to
train a gradient boosting model on a balanced dataset. The perfor-
mance is measured in terms of ROC AUC. Figure 9(b) shows the
individual classification performance for that task for each feature
group. The content and edit features are the most important (AUC
= 0.76). This makes the case for an influence of the way content is

presented to the user on lowering or increasing the resistance of a
page. Unlike for searchshare, the network features are indicative
for the resistance of an article (AUC = 0.68).
This suggests that
the network position of an article influences the extent to which
it channels traffic. The topic plays only a small role, which again
highlights the importance of the quality of the content presentation
and production process.
Summary.
In general,
modeling article resistance is easier than
modeling searchshare as suggested by the higher ROC AUC values.
Modeling searchshare is challenging due to the influence of external
events (e.g.,
the transition data exhibits high view numbers on
articles about the Summer Olympics 2016), and the content diversity.
However, investing in diverse content from different topics seems
to be the best way for Wikipedia to attract people as the article’s
topic is the most indicative feature regarding searchshare. On the
other hand, the content presentation, and the article’s position in
the network are decisive for its ability to relay traffic.

RELATED WORK
Since the inception of the Web, researchers have been studying the
user content consumption behavior. Initially, content has been ac-
cessed by traversing hyperlinks on the Web [
14
]. This navigational
user behavior on the Web and on Wikipedia is often modeled using
well-established methods such as Markov chains [
3
,
23
,
25
,
29
,
30
]
and decentralized search models [
5
,
12
]. Numerous navigational hy-
potheses on Wikipedia have also been presented based on, e.g., click
traces stemming from navigational games and on click data from
server logs. For example, West and Leskovec observed a trade-off
between similarity and popularity to the target article in the user
sessions of Wikispeedia [
37
]. Lamprecht et al. studied the general
navigability of several Wikipedia language editions and showed
how the Wikipedia article structure influences the user click be-
havior [
15
,
16
]. Dimitrov et al. conducted a large-scale study on the
navigational behavior on Wikipedia. They found that users tend
to select links located in the beginning of Wikipedia articles and
links leading to articles located in the network periphery [
6
,
7
].
By constructing a navigational phase space from transition data,
Gilderslave and Yasseri studied internal navigation on Wikipedia
and identified articles with extreme, atypical, and mimetic behav-
ior [
11
]. Web content can be also discovered by formulating and
executing a search query. Kumar and Tomkins performed an initial
characterization of the user search behavior [
13
], while Weber and
Jaimes studied the search engine usage with respect to the users
demographics, topics, and session length [
36
]. Earlier Wikipedia
reading behavior studies focused on explaining bursts, dynamics of
topic popularity and search query analysis to Wikipedia [
17
,
26
,
32
–
34
]. A more recent study by Singer et al. investigated the Wikipedia
readers motivations [
31
]. By complementing a reader survey with
server log data, they discovered specific behavior patterns for dif-
ferent motivations, i.e., bored readers tend to produce long article
sequences spanning different topics. McMahon et al. focused on
the interdependence between search engines, i.e., Google and Wiki-
pedia [
21
]. They showed that Google is responsible for generating
high traffic to Wikipedia articles, although, in some cases traffic is
reduced due to the direct inclusion of Wikipedia content in search
results. Compared to our work, McMahon et al. concentrate on the
peer production site and not on the content consumption. While
there is a long line of research with respect to search and – more
so – navigation, they have rarely been studied together which is
the focus of this work.

DISCUSSION
As a general observation, our results shed light on the different roles
of articles with respect to traffic entering and leaving Wikipedia.
On one hand, an overwhelming amount of pages attracts mostly
direct search traffic and only little internal navigation, thanks to
Wikipedia’s strong symbiotic relationship with web search engines.
Yet, notably, most of that traffic goes to articles that act mainly as
exit points, i.e., users to not continue visiting Wikipedia directly
afterwards.
This is congruent with,
but not necessarily because
of, a pure “look up” nature of search. Only a very small share of
searched articles is responsible for relaying disproportionally large
amounts of traffic into the rest of Wikipedia. We see that these arti-
cles are well-connected, more edited and more extensive than their
exit counterparts, although we cannot yet conclude whether this
is because of a “worn path” paradigm, wherein links and content
are built because of the natural thematic positioning and suitabil-
ity of an article to act as an entry point and as a bridge to more
content, or because the a-priori structure of these article facilitates
the observed navigational patterns. A longitudinal study, which we
plan for future work, could obtain more detailed insights on this
co-evolution of structural features and navigation.
Furthermore,
our data shows that articles, which are able to forward traffic, sit
mostly at the very (k-)core of the link network. However, this is
not necessarily the case for being a receiver of navigation traffic,
with searchshare values stabilizing already at lower k-cores – and
with inlinks not being more highly correlated with k-core than
outlinks. This hints to the fact that – to some extent – users enter
Wikipedia by search on more central articles, and then navigate
outwards from more to less central nodes. This is consistent with
previous findings studying navigation on Wikipedia [7].
Regarding articles with different topical alignments, we see cer-
tain evidence that the thematic domain of a user’s information
pursuit seems connected with the “mode” of how this informa-
tion is attained. While the highly aggregate data used in this work
does not allow for direct inferences as to the type of information
retrieval in the continuum between a targeted and well-defined
lookup and a completely serendipitous discovery process, we can
nonetheless discern distinct patterns between article topics.
Al-
though “Architecutre” articles are not more devoid of in- or out-
navigation opportunities than “Military” ones, they show far higher
amounts of search views and exit points,
while the latter one is
navigated at a constantly high level, regardless of their connected-
ness. A possible explanation of the navigation-heavy behavior on
“Military” articles is that people like follow paths through events in
order to understand historical developments.
For our analysis, we utilize publicly available clickstream data
about Wikipedia. However, due to privacy restrictions, the data con-
tains only (referrer, resource) pairs that occurred at least ten times
during the data collection period. This could lead to a skewed view
on the access behavior when contrasting search and navigation. For
example, if an article is navigated in total much more than ten times

over different links, but each individual link is transitioned less than
ten times, all of these transitions will not be included in the data.
In this case, the searchshare for this article might get substantially
overestimated. Since this might occur specifically for articles with
overall few page views, it may be a potential explanation for some
findings, e.g., that article in the periphery of the link network show
a stronger prevalence of search.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work,
we studied the prevalence of user access prefer-
ences across articles on Wikipedia. For that purpose, we introduced
searchshare and resistance as two key features to characterize article
traffic. While we can identify search as the more dominant access
paradigm compared to navigation on Wikipedia overall, we observe
heterogeneous behavior at different types of articles. That is, de-
pending on the article topic and other article properties, the share of
navigation and search strongly varies, as well the amount of traffic
an article relays to other Wikipedia pages. For example, articles on
topics such as “Military” exhibit above average access by navigation,
while topics such as “Architecture” show a strong prevalence of
search. Furthermore, edit activity on a an article and its position in
the network is strongly correlated with its ability to relay traffic on
Wikipedia. Thus, we find overall that both, search and navigation
play a crucial role for information seeking on Wikipedia.
In the future, we plan to extend our studies over time intervals
and to other language editions in order to further explore cultural
differences in the identified access patterns.
