Abstract 
In this work we offer an open and data-driven skills taxonomy, which is independent 
of ESCO and O*NET, two popular available taxonomies that are expert-derived. 
Since the taxonomy is created in an algorithmic way without expert elicitation, it can 
be quickly updated to reflect changes in labour demand and provide timely insights 
to support labour market decision-making. Our proposed taxonomy also captures 
links between skills, aggregated job titles, and the salaries mentioned in the millions 
of UK job adverts used in this analysis. To generate the taxonomy, we employ 
machine learning methods, such as word embeddings, network community detection 
algorithms and consensus clustering. We model skills as a graph with individual 
skills as vertices and their co-occurrences in job adverts as edges. The strength of 
the relationships between the skills is measured using both the frequency of actual 
co-occurrences of skills in the same advert as well as their shared context, based on 
a trained word embeddings model. Once skills are represented as a network, we 
hierarchically group them into clusters. To ensure the stability of the resulting 
clusters, we introduce bootstrapping and consensus clustering stages into the 
methodology. While we share initial results and describe the skill clusters, the main 
purpose of this paper is to outline the methodology for building the taxonomy.

Introduction
In this work,
we propose a data-driven taxonomy of
skills mentioned by employers in online job adverts.
We use the term “skills” to refer to all employer requirements including those relating to competences and
knowledge.
This is the first publicly available taxonomy we are aware of that does not rely on existing models
and ontologies such as the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) and European Skills, Competences,
Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO). It is also derived in an algorithmic way without expert elicitation,
which means that it can be quickly updated to reflect changes in labour demand and provide timely insights
to support labour market decision-making.
To generate the taxonomy we employ machine learning methods,
such as word embeddings and network
community detection algorithms.
We model skills as a graph with individual skills as vertices and their co-
occurrences in job adverts as edges.
The strength of the relationships between the skills is measured using
both frequency of actual co-occurrences of the skills in the same advert as well as their shared context, based
on a trained word embeddings model.
Once skills are represented as a network, we hierarchically group them
into clusters.
To ensure the stability of
the resulting clusters,
we introduce bootstrapping and consensus
clustering stages into the methodology.
While we share initial
results and describe the skill
clusters,
the
main purpose of this paper is to outline the methodology for building the taxonomy.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.
We start by describing the motivation for developing
a new skills taxonomy and relevant research.
In the Methods section,
we provide a detailed description of
the methodology used to generate the skills taxonomy,
followed by an overview of the initial
results.
The
1
limitations of
the approach are reviewed in the Discussion section.
We conclude with a summary of
the
contributions of the paper and suggestions for future research.
Motivation
A growing body of
research predicts that the labour force will
undergo substantial
changes in the near
future.
Globalisation and technological developments, together with environmental and demographic trends,
will
reshape labour market structures.
A recent study by Nesta and Pearson predicts with confidence
that around 20% of
occupations will
shrink and 10% will
grow,
but for the remaining occupations the
outlook is highly uncertain (Bakhshi,
Downing,
Osborne,
and Schneider,
2017).
The nature of
work and
the requirements for effective job performance are also likely to change with new skills,
competences and
knowledge areas emerging, while other requirements become redundant (World Economic Forum, 2018).
In
this context, policymakers, educators, businesses and individuals need timely information on both how the
labour market is changing and what the potential pathways are for upgrading workers’ skills and transitioning
workers out of occupations at risk of decline.
To generate such actionable insights we first,
however,
need
a framework for measuring the similarity of skill requirements and grouping them in meaningful taxonomic
groups.
In this paper, we propose a methodology for discovering such a taxonomy in a data-driven way using
non-traditional naturally occurring big data on the UK labour market.
Existing sources of
information on occupational
requirements have several
limitations.
Current publicly
available models and taxonomies, such as O*NET (National Research Council, 2010) and ESCO (Directorate-
General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, 2017) are expert-derived, which makes them expensive
to update on an ongoing basis.
As a result, there is a risk that information on skills might become outdated.
Another limitation is that in their current state,
the taxonomies do not fully capture the relationships
between skills,
competences and knowledge requirements.
In ESCO,
occupations are explicitly linked to
skills,
but the information on how the skills are connected to each other is only provided for transversal
skills.
Transversal skills refer to skills that are not specific to particular occupations, but rather are relevant
to a broad range of occupations.
Alongside taxonomies like O*NET and ESCO,
researchers in the private sector have also developed skills
taxonomies using vast amounts of data from online job adverts and job seeker resumes.
However, these are
not open to the public.
In addition, none of the existing taxonomies have been developed using UK data and
therefore may be less suitable for the analysis and measurement of skill requirements in UK occupations.
To
fill the gap in the existing skills taxonomies and frameworks, we propose an empirically-driven taxonomy that
is derived automatically from online job adverts.
The proposed taxonomy offers a number of advantages over
existing ones.
First,
it leverages naturally occurring data on millions of vacancies,
which can be efficiently
collected at scale and in real
time.
Using online job adverts also allows us to capture skills required by
employers directly; in the adverts, employers are free to describe what they are looking for in candidates and
are not constrained to select the requirements from a narrow number of skill groups.
Another advantage of
the taxonomy we propose is that we can enrich it with other information available in job adverts,
such as
offered salary and job title.
Last, but not least, we are committed to making our taxonomy and methodology
open to the public, which we think is important if the data are used to inform public policy.
We believe that our data-driven skills taxonomy can directly contribute to more responsive and evidence-
based policy making.
Timely information on the demand for, and salaries associated with, particular skills,
competences and knowledge areas can help policymakers prioritise investment in skill development.
The pro-
posed taxonomy, together with the occupational classification we developed in a previous paper (Djumalieva,
Lima, and Sleeman, 2017), can be combined to develop a recommender engine for identifying occupations that
require similar skills.
These insights could then inform policies for reskilling and supporting job transitions
from occupations at risk of decline.

Related work
The systematic analysis of the occupational requirements has been a prominent area of labour market research
for the past two decades.
One of the most widely used models of occupational
characteristics and worker
attributes is O*NET, which was developed in late 1990s with support from the US Department of Labor and
the Employment and Training Administration (Markowitsch and Plaimauer,
2009).
For each occupation,
O*NET provides detailed descriptions of worker characteristics and requirements, necessary levels of training,
education and experience,
job characteristics and occupational
outlooks.
O*NET is periodically updated
using information from occupational
experts and job holders as well
as from job postings.
The European
Commission’s ESCO represents another major public effort to systematise occupational information.
ESCO
is an ontology that maps relationships between skills, qualifications and occupations that are aligned with the
International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). Following several years of expert collaboration
and public consultations,
the first full
version of
ESCO was released in October 2017.
Both O*NET and
ESCO are open to the public.
With regards to data-driven skills taxonomies,
research in this area has,
of late,
been concentrated in the
private sector.
In one such study, Zhao, Javed, Jacob, and McNair (2015) used data from 100 million resumes
on CareerBuilder to generate a taxonomy of skills.
In processing the resumes,
the authors disambiguated
and normalised 46 million unique skill phrases.
This resulted in a taxonomy of 50,000 skills.
However,
the
content and structure of the taxonomy was not made public.
To date, as far as we are aware, there are no
purely data-driven skills taxonomies in the public domain.
Most researchers in this field use data-driven approaches to extend ESCO instead of
developing new tax-
onomies.
For example, Sibarani et al. (2017) propose SARO - an ontology that connects information from job
postings to ESCO skills.
Authors tested automatically implementing SARO for extracting data from online
vacancies for data scientists and performed a trend analysis for selected skills (Dadzie, Sibarani, Novalija, and
Scerri, 2017). Boselli et al. (2017) also used relationships between ESCO occupations and skills to represent
them in a bipartite knowledge graph, which enriches skills identified by experts for a given occupation with
data from actual job adverts.
It is likely that ESCO was chosen by researchers as a foundation due to its rich
multilingual vocabulary of 13,485 skills as well as the availability of links between skills and occupations.
A methodology for the data-driven analysis of online job adverts was offered by Turrell et al. (forthcoming).
The authors pursued a similar approach to the one we propose and implemented a bottom-up classification
of jobs using vacancy descriptions in UK online job adverts.
However,
in their work Turrell
et al.
focused
on identifying naturally existing occupational
clusters and grouped individual
jobs rather than employer
requirements.
Within the context of the existing literature, our work contributes to the field in several ways.
First, we offer
a non-expert-driven taxonomy of
skills required by employers that is independent of
ESCO and O*NET.
Since the taxonomy is created automatically, it’s also easier to reproduce and keep up-to-date.
And unlike
taxonomies developed by the private sector, our taxonomy and methodology will be released to the public.
Our proposed taxonomy also captures links between skills, aggregated job titles, and the salaries mentioned
in the millions of UK job adverts used in this analysis.
Data
The online job advert dataset used in this paper was provided by Burning Glass Technologies,
a labour
market analytics company.
Burning Glass collects data on active job postings from thousands of web-pages
on a daily basis (Burning Glass Technologies,
2017).
For each job posting,
in addition to extracting job
title,
salary,
education and experience requirements,
Burning Glass identifies keywords from free text job
descriptions.
The full
job descriptions are not available.
We refer to the keywords as skills,
which include
skills,
personal
competences and knowledge required by employers.
To develop the initial
skills taxonomy
3
we use data on over 41 million adverts collected over a five-year period from January 2012 to December
2017.
It is important to note that in our dataset there are many adverts with missing information:
only
61% of adverts contain data on offered salary,
and substantially fewer mention education (19% of adverts)
and experience requirements (13% of adverts).
Methods
We use two approaches to measure the relationships between skills mentioned in Burning Glass job adverts
(Figure 1).
The first approach is based on the pairwise frequency of two skills appearing in the same job
advert.
The second approach is based on the distributed representation of skills.
We generate the vector
representations of skills by training a word2vec model,
which learns the extent to which skills occur in the
same context (i.e.
together with other skills).
As a next step,
we model
the skills as a graph,
where vertices represent individual
skills.
The vertices are
joined by edges if they are mentioned in the same advert.
The edges between vertices have attributes that
describe the strength of
the relationship,
such as frequency (total
number of
pairwise skill
mentions) and
cosine similarity (similarity of the context in which the two skills occur across all adverts).
Figure 1:
Process of discovering hierarchical skills taxonomy
Data Preparation
To prepare the data for the analysis,
we first clean the skills removing any punctuation,
special
characters
and numbers.
We also exclude several
groups of
skills,
which are:
frequently inaccurate skills,
phrases
related to industry experience (that aren’t related to skills) and skills mentioned three or fewer times over
the six-year period.
The 14 frequently inaccurate skills were identified in previous analysis of
Burning
Glass adverts and include acronyms which can refer to different sets of
words when expanded (e.g.
CPR:
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation or Civil
procedures rules) and irrelevant phrases scraped accidentally from
web-pages (e.g. “image processing”, “facebook”).
In total 891 skills are excluded.
These account for 7.8% of
all skills and comprise 3.1% of all skill mentions.
Building the Skills Graph
We use a graph approach to model
the relationships between skills.
Representing skills as a graph allows
us to go beyond studying pairwise connections between skills and identify groups of skills that are densely
connected to each other.
To build the skills graph we traverse all job adverts and count the co-occurrences
of skills.
We then represent the counts as an (N,
N) adjacency matrix,
where N is the number of unique
skills and the elements in the matrix indicate the number of skill co-occurrences.
We then use the adjacency
4
matrix to generate an undirected graph, G = (V, E), where vertices, V, are the skills, and edges, E, are the
co-occurrences of the skills in the same advert.
To capture the strength of relationships in the network, we use two parameters for network edges: f, frequency
and c,
cosine similarity.
Frequency refers to the most intuitive measure of skill
relationships,
and for two
skills connected by an edge, it represents the total number of unique adverts that mention both skills.
Put
simply,
the higher the frequency of
the edge,
the higher the co-occurrence of
the skills and the stronger
the relationship between them.
However,
this measure is flawed,
since it will
amplify the strength of
the
relationships between frequently occurring skills, such as sales management or mechanical engineering.
This
will make it more difficult to detect substantive relationships between skills that are mentioned less frequently.
The decision on which metric to use for measuring the strength of
edges has important implications for
the community detection stage,
since many algorithms use the edge-strength property as weights when
partitioning the graph.
In the case of skills, we are also likely to have situations where a skill (e.g.
computer-
aided design,
predictive modelling,
etc.)
is mentioned in more than one domain and using frequency would
result in assigning the skill to the largest domain.
As an alternative to a frequency-based measure of
strength between skills,
we trial
context based vector
representations.
These distributed representations,
also known as word embeddings,
refer to a Natural
Language Processing technique used to capture semantic similarities of terms based on their distribution in
large text corpora (Jurafsky and Martin, 2017).
Word embeddings convert terms, or in our case skills, into
vectors that reflect the context in which the skills occur.
The context refers to the probability that given
terms or skills will be found together in a sentence or job advert.
There is evidence in support of the higher
accuracy of distributed representations of terms over frequency based approaches (Zhao, Javed, Jacob, and
McNair, 2015).
One of the leading methods for generating word embeddings is word2vec, which is based on
shallow neural network language models (Mikolov, Sutskever, Chen, Corrado, and Dean, 2013).
To compute
distributed representations of skills in the online job adverts we use the continuous bag of words word2vec
model
as implemented in the python gensim library (Rehurek and Sojka,
2010).
We train the word2vec
model on 41 million online job adverts, ignoring adverts that mention 20 or more requirements.
This filter
is applied because the exploratory analysis showed that adverts with over 20 keywords typically combine
descriptions of more than one vacancy.
As demonstrated in Table 1, the trained word2vec model is able to
uncover meaningful patterns in job adverts.

The resulting word2vec model outputs a set of unique skill vectors.
The skills that occur in similar contexts
(i.e.
are often mentioned with the same skills in job adverts) will have similar vectors.
We can then compute
pairwise cosine similarity scores for all the skill vectors and use these to weight the edges in the skills graph.
Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the skills graph,
where two skills ‘radiology’
and ‘diagnostic
imaging’
were mentioned together 1,585 times and the cosine similarity of
their word2vec vectors is 0.66.

The summary of the steps taken to build the skills graph is provided in Appendix 2 (Figure 11).
Figure 2:
Schematic representation of the skills graph
Properties of the Skills Graph
The skills graph consists of 10,554 vertices and 4,015,549 edges.
The properties of the graph resemble those
of
other real-life networks,
where vertex degrees and centrality are very heterogeneous.
From the highly
positively skewed distributions of vertex degrees and eigenvector centrality shown in Figures 3 and 4, we can
see that in the network there is a subset of highly central skills,
which are connected to a large proportion
of other skills in the network.
Figure 3:
Distribution of skill degrees
This observation reflects the fact that,
in our dataset,
skills vary in how specific they are:
some of
the
skills are very broad, or transversal.
Examples of these transversal skills are communication skills, problem
solving and business management.
Other requirements are domain specific but still broad, such as molecular
biology,
python and surgery.
Finally,
there are very specific skills,
such as succession planning and visual
merchandising.
Identifying and Removing Transversal Skills
Our initial attempts to detect the naturally existing communities in the graph demonstrated that the presence
of
highly central
skills engenders one giant community that contains most skills and very few specialised
communities.
This makes sense since we can imagine how transversal
skills may connect vertices in the
graph that have little else in common.
To address this, we identify and remove highly transversal skills; we
also use cosine similarity as the edge strength parameter.
6
Figure 4:
Distribution of skills’ eigenvector centrality
In order to identify highly transversal skills, we consider two vertex properties:
eigenvector centrality and the
local clustering coefficient.
Eigenvector centrality is a measure of vertex influence, so if a vertex is connected
to vertices with a high number of degrees,
its centrality will
be high (Austin,
2006).
The local
clustering
coefficient reflects how embedded the vertex is in its neighbourhood.
If one vertex has a lower local clustering
coefficient than another, it implies that fewer of that vertex’s neighbours are connected to each other (Watts
and Strogatz, 1998).
We argue that a highly transversal skill is likely to have a high eigenvector centrality
and a low local
clustering coefficient,
since the vertices they connect have relatively few other connections
in common.
We recognise that it is not simply the case that each skill is either transversal or not.
Instead
each skill will lie somewhere along a continuum with transversal skills at one end and specialist skills at the
other.
Similarly, in the ESCO taxonomy, skills are divided into transversal, cross-sector, sector specific and
occupation specific categories.
To explore whether the skill requirements in the Burning Glass data fall into
similar categories, we fit a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to skills’ eigenvector centrality scores to explore
naturally occurring concentrations of
skills.
After initial
exploration,
we identify 19 groups with varying
levels of specialisation (Table 2).

We can see that groups 1 and 2 are highly transversal:
the skills requirements in these groups have the
highest eigenvector centrality and very low local
clustering coefficients (Figure 5).
The top 10 skills in the
first group are shown in Table 3.
Figure 5:
Characteristics of skill groups identified using GMM with eigenvector centrality
We discovered that the more highly transversal
skill
groups we removed,
the more fragmented the skills
network became.
It appears that some broad skills serve as a glue connecting more niche skill
clusters.
Because of
this and to preserve as much information as possible,
we only remove group 1,
which has the
lowest specialisation and comprises 66 skills.
While they represent only 0.6% of all vertices, the connections
between these skills account for 11.15% of all edges in the graph.

Figure 11 in Appendix 2 summarises the steps taken to build the skills graph and prepare it for the community
detection stage.
Detecting Communities
Prior to applying community detection algorithms,
we reviewed the filtered graph and found that 38% of
existing edges have cosine similarity of 0 or lower.
This may be because some of the pairwise links reflect
spurious co-occurrences and that even if
two skills are mentioned together in a few adverts they are not
8
mentioned frequently enough in the same context.
With this in mind, we remove any edges where the cosine
similarity is equal to 0 or lower.
We have considered three different approaches to detecting communities in a graph:
a method based on
statistical inference (Stochastic Block Model), a method based on optimising the clustering quality parameter
(Louvain) and a method based on exploring dynamical processes on the graph (Infomap).
A brief
overview of
algorithms is provided in Appendix 1.
An initial
comparative analysis of
the three
methods shows that they are all
valid ways to partition the network.
The non-hierarchical
SBM identifies
283 communities, which appear to capture meaningful relationships between skills.
However, the hierarchical
implementation of SBM turns out not to be suitable because the clusters are grouped into higher levels based
on the similarity of their connections (i.e.
a similar number of edges) but ignore the subject domains.
For
example,
computing- and medicine-related skills are placed in the same higher level
group.
The fact that
only the non-hierarchical SBM clusters can be used for our purposes means that we need to identify a way
to aggregate smaller clusters into broader groups.
We explore hierarchical
clustering using the clusters’
representative word embedding vectors.
However,
determining the appropriate way to generate representative vectors and selecting cutoffs for splitting the
hierarchy into layers adds considerable subjectivity to the methodology.
This is why we do not use the SBM
in this analysis.
The broad groups identified by the Louvain algorithm are similar to those found by Infomap.
However,
Infomap detects a larger number of small, specialised employer requirement clusters; the algorithm appears
to be peeling off more peripheral
clusters at each iteration.
For both algorithms,
the cosine similarity
property of edges is used.
The Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) score for the top level of Infomap and
the 2nd level
of Louvain (chosen because they have a similar number of groups) is relatively high at 0.67,
which indicates similar clustering (the maximum value of NMI is 1 for perfect correlation).
Since Infomap
identifies few large clusters and many very small
clusters at each layer of the taxonomy,
we decide to use
Louvain as it produces more evenly distributed clusters.
Increasing robustness of clustering
We initially used the Louvain algorithm to detect communities with the highest corresponding modularity
and iteratively split these communities if the new partition had a positive modularity value.
However, some
of the identified clusters, especially at the lower layers of the hierarchy, appeared to be driven by stochastic
artefacts rather than meaningful
differences.
The fact that splitting a cluster improves graph modularity
score doesn’t mean that the resulting lower level clusters are well separated.
The challenge is to identify an
objective criterion for determining confidence in cluster partitioning.
To ensure the stability of the resulting
groups, we introduce bootstrapping and consensus clustering stages in the methodology.
Bootstrapping refers
to random sampling with replacement.
This technique is used in machine learning to increase robustness
of models since it allows for better exploration of biases and variation in the underlying dataset.
Typically
bootstrapping involves sampling of
individual
observations,
which would be skills in our case.
However,
to preserve as many actual
skills in the graph as possible,
we follow an approach outlined by Rosvall
and
Bergstrom (2010) and instead of bootstrapping nodes we sample graph edges.
We also assign to each edge a
probability of being selected, which is proportional to the edge cosine similarity property.
As a result we are
more likely to select edges between nodes that are strongly related and less likely to sample spurious edges.
As shown in Figure 6, once a bootstrapped sample is formed, we build a new graph using the edges in our
sample and then apply the Louvain algorithm to detect communities with highest modularity.
We repeat
these steps 500 times,
record node membership in resulting clusters and reconcile results from these runs
using the cluster ensemble technique.
The cluster ensemble method produces a single consensus partition
and is performed using Hyper-graph partitioning (HGPA) and Meta-clustering algorithms (MCLA) (Strehl
and Ghosh,
2002) as implemented in Cluster Ensemble python package (Giecold,
Marco,
Garcia,
Trippa,
and Yuan, 2016).
The quality of clustering is determined based on the level of agreement, which is measured
9
as a weighted average NMI between all the runs and the resulting consensus cluster membership.
We select
the solution with the highest level of agreement.
Once the top layer membership is finalised,
the approach
is repeated for each cluster at layer 2 and 3.
Figure 6:
Process of generating consensus clustering across bootstrapped samples
The process for detecting hierarchical
communities in the skills graph using bootstrapping is described in
Figure 12 in Appendix 2.
Results
As illustrated in Figure 7,
using the Louvain algorithm with bootstrapping,
we generate consensus cluster
assignments at three layers.
It’s possible to explore finer layers of the hierarchy.
However, for the convenience
of profiling clusters we stop at depth three where we find 143 clusters. The cluster labels are assigned manually
after reviewing the most prominent skills as well as the most common job titles and SOC codes.
In future
work, we will aim to develop an automatic way of labelling the clusters at all levels.
Figure 7:
Number of clusters in each layer of the skills taxonomy
There are six broad clusters (Figure 8) at the top layer of
the skills taxonomy.
These are Education,
sales and marketing (6 sub-clusters), Information technology (5 sub-clusters), Science and research (7 sub-
clusters),
Engineering,
construction and transport
(5 sub-clusters),
Health and social
care (7 sub-clusters)
and Business Administration (5 sub-clusters).
There were some surprises in the skills groupings, such as education, languages and art skills being grouped
together with marketing,
design and sales.
It is likely that this is explained by the connection between
10
Figure 8:
Distribution of skills and unique job adverts across top layer of taxonomy
teaching foreign languages and using them in sales roles.
Medical device sales skills were also assigned to a
health related group rather than to a sales cluster.
This may reflect that a certain level of clinical experience
is required in medical sales jobs.
To facilitate the exploration of the skills hierarchy, a prototype interactive data visualisation was developed
(Figure 9,
10).
The visualisation shows the three layers of the hierarchy but not the underlying individual
skills.
In the visualisation we also provide a brief description of each cluster,
including average salary,
the
top five skills,
the most common job titles and the proportion of unique job adverts that mention skills in
the cluster.
Cluster robustness
The level
of
agreement varies for different layers of
the skills taxonomy.
At the top layer,
across 500
bootstrapped samples, the weighted average NMI is equal to 0.85, which indicates a high level of agreement
(weighted average NMI equals 1 for complete agreement).
At the deeper layers,
the level
of
agreement is
lower for certain groups (Table 4).
For instance,
for Science and research,
the average NMI is 0.60.
This
measure is also below 0.70 for Engineering,
construction and transport
and Health and social
care.
There
are two possible explanations for the lower level
of
agreement on cluster membership between different
iterations of
the algorithm.
First,
it is likely that in some skill
domains there is a substantial
degree of
complementarity between skills.
So,
in the Health and social
care domain,
skills related to nursing can be
applied in primary care as well as in critical care.
This means that during the bootstrapping and community
detection stages,
we may identify alternative combinations of
skills that are often required together.
The
second explanation relates to the fact that certain skills are more transversal.
While we remove the most
prominent transversal skills early on, some remaining skills still demonstrate higher than average centrality.
It is possible that these skills keep moving between clusters and lead to a lower level of agreement between
clustering iterations.
One example of such a skill is biology, which refers to a general knowledge applicable
in molecular biology,
infectious disease research and other areas of
life science research.
In the future we
will
aim to identify these domain-central
skills to measure their impact on cluster robustness.
But,
more
importantly, these skills might represent foundation-skills, which can widen the feasible set of job transitions
for individuals.

Discussion
While the skills taxonomy is generated entirely automatically without expert input,
it appears to perform
reasonably well
in identifying distinct groups of
skills,
competences and knowledge.
As shown in Tables
5 and 6 in Appendix 2,
the cluster profiles,
especially at the first and second layers of
the taxonomy,
reflect established occupational
domains,
such as Education,
Health,
Information Technology and Business
Administration.
The metadata on skill
clusters,
such as salary and job titles,
also appear to be generally
aligned with the data from official
statistics.
For example,
the clusters with the highest average salary are
located in Securities trading and Data engineering,
while the lowest paid skill
clusters are in Medical
and
Office administration (all of these clusters reside in the third layer of hierarchy).
Initial
results demonstrate that the data-driven approach to grouping skills,
competences and knowledge
areas has its merits.
At the same time,
in its current state,
the methodology for deriving the hierarchical
taxonomy has several
limitations.
The first limitation is that we do not allow skills to exist in multiple
parts of the taxonomy.
The current hierarchical
structure places a skill
in the cluster in which it is most
strongly connected to other members.
However,
it is likely that certain skills,
competences and knowledge
such as cooking and data science will
have lateral
links to other clusters.
For example,
cooking resides
in Social
work and caregiving,
but can also be connected to food service in retail.
Similarly,
data science,
which is currently in Marketing research,
could also sit in Data engineering.
To address the limitations of
hard partitioning, we propose complementing the provided hierarchical structure with a simplified graph of
skill clusters.
In this graph, all the vertices will be contracted to their 3rd layer clusters.
The links between
the 143 clusters can then be aggregated and used to explore the lateral relationships between skill clusters.
The second limitation relates to the current lack of clarity on how to incorporate incoming information on job
adverts.
In future work, we would like to explore the advantages and disadvantages of running the analysis
on the whole dataset,
updated with new information,
as opposed to generating the word embeddings and
the taxonomy on temporal
slices of the data.
For further validation and to assess the extent to which the
clusters are distinct, we will also collect text from Wikipedia articles on individual skills in each cluster.
We
will then analyse the extent to which article terms are associated with certain skill clusters using the mutual
information method.
Given the nested nature of the taxonomy,
we expect the clusters at deeper hierarchy
layers to be more similar and refer to the same subject domains.
This is why the proposed analysis is likely
to be more appropriate, as a validation method, if applied to first and second layers only.
Finally,
the skill
cluster labelling needs to be automated to enable regular re-running of
the methodol-
ogy. However, generating labels automatically is a challenging task.
Our initial strategy involved using the
three most demanded skills in the cluster as a label.
This method did not produce satisfactory results as
often these three skills did not communicate the broadness of the skills cluster and appeared to describe a
relatively narrow segment of skills.
Including more than three skills makes the label too long and difficult to
read in tables and data visualisations.
In future research,
we plan to explore other strategies to automate
labelling.
One strategy is to search Wikipedia for the skills in the clusters and identify the most common
terms and categories used to describe them.
For example,
a common term occurring in descriptions for
cardiology and oncology could be specialised medicine.
While the data-driven approach used to generate the skills taxonomy offers significant advantages, the end
users of the taxonomy might still perceive an expert curated taxonomy to have a higher quality.
This may
be due to the fact that expert curated taxonomies incorporate data from different sources and reflect input
from relevant industry bodies.
To increase the validity of the proposed skills taxonomy we intend to refine
the resulting taxonomy using feedback from ONS occupational experts, career advice services, educators and
professional associations.
This will enable us to increase the utility of the taxonomy for users.

Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrate how a taxonomy of employer skills, competence and knowledge requirements
can be derived in a data-driven way.
Using the initial
results of
the proposed method,
we show that the
automatically generated skills taxonomy performs reasonably well.
The taxonomy contains three hierar-
chical
layers,
which are identified by applying a modularity optimisation community detection algorithm
with bootstrapping and consensus clustering.
The quality of
the clustering is enhanced by using a word
embeddings approach to capture the strength of relationships between the skills as opposed to relying only
on a frequency-based measure.
In addition to generating the taxonomy,
we also extract useful
metadata on each skill
cluster,
mapping
relationships between skill
clusters and salary,
occupations,
and job titles.
We also trial
a method for
determining the level of a skill specialisation by applying the Gaussian mixture model technique to the skill
eigenvector centrality.
We make a number of
contributions to the existing literature.
The proposed skills taxonomy represents
the first transparent non-expert-driven taxonomy that is independent from established frameworks such
as ESCO or O*NET.
The taxonomy is developed automatically and identifies meaningful
patterns in the
employer requirements without any pre-conditions for how requirements should be grouped.
Because of this,
the taxonomy minimises the risk that interrelationships between skills are overlooked because they don’t fit a
traditional view of how skills should be organised.
For example, machine learning and pattern recognition are
usually grouped with computing skills, while in our taxonomy, these reside in the Physics and math cluster.
Even though these skills are often applied together with programming,
they are grounded in knowledge of
mathematics.
One of the important contributions of the proposed skills taxonomy is that it offers a possibility of describing
occupations from the perspective of skills.
This is why, in the upcoming applied analysis paper, we intend to
map this skills taxonomy to ONS SOC codes.
As an exploratory exercise, we have studied the composition
of
the 200 most popular job titles by the third layer skill
clusters.
The results listing each job title and
the most prominent skill
clusters are shown in Table 7 in Appendix 3.
In future work,
we will
extend this
approach from job titles to SOC codes.
The resulting crosswalk between skill
clusters and SOC codes will
create a foundation for combining official labour market statistics with the skills taxonomy to produce novel
measures of skills demand, supply and mismatch.
In future research,
we also plan to extend the current hierarchical
representation of the taxonomy into an
ontology,
where not just the direct,
but also the lateral
relationships between clusters are captured.
The
resulting ontology can then be implemented as a graph database accessible by the public.
We would also
like to study the evolution of employer requirements over time using the methodology described in Rosvall
and Bergstrom (2010).
The resulting skills taxonomy as well as the algorithm for developing it and the interactive data visualisation
will all be released to the public.
We believe that these resources would benefit a wide audience and allow
policymakers,
educators and individuals to better understand the skill
sets needed by employers and the
associated salaries and job titles.
The taxonomy also provides a foundation for measuring the similarity of
jobs/occupations based on skills,
competences and knowledge.
These insights could be directly applied to
inform policy on reskilling and identifying job transition opportunities for occupations at risk of decline.

Appendix 1:
Overview of community detection algorithms
Stochastic Block Modelling (SBM) involves fitting a generative model
of a graph to data (Peixoto,
2017).
Under SBM, nonparametric statistical inference is applied to partition the graph in such a way as to maximise
the explanatory power of
a fitted model
given the observed edges.
From the candidates,
the minimum
description length model (i.e.
the simplest model) is selected to prevent overfitting.
SBMs have been found
to produce some of
the best results on real-life networks and are capable of
identifying several
types of
network structures in addition to communities.
SBMs can also detect hierarchical
structures in networks
and can be extended to overlapping communities.
For the purposes of our analysis, we use a degree-corrected
SBM that employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (Peixoto, 2014) as implemented in the
python igraph library.
The Louvain multilevel community detection algorithm identifies communities in the network that maximise
the quality of the partitioning (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, and Lefebvre, 2008).
The established metric
used to measure the quality of communities is modularity.
Modularity varies between [-1,1] and refers to the
concentration of edges within communities as opposed to the distribution of edges that would be observed
in a random graph with the same vertex degree distribution.
The Louvain algorithm is hierarchical; it starts
with individual vertices belonging to their own communities and then iteratively groups the vertices in such
a way as to increase the overall modularity score.
This algorithm is intuitive and one of the most commonly
used for identifying network communities.
Louvain was found to be the second best-performing method
in the comparative analysis of algorithms conducted by Lancichinetti
and Fortunato (Fortunato and Hric,
2016).
The criticism of the modularity optimisation algorithms focuses on the limitations of these methods in
identifying an appropriate level of resolution.
The algorithms may split large communities or merge smaller
ones.
They may also underperform as compared to other methods if
the true number of
clusters is not
known.
Infomap is a dynamics based community detection algorithm,
which identifies communities in the network
by measuring the flow of
information through the network using random walks (Rosvall
and Bergstrom,
2008).
The rationale behind the method is that due to the higher density of edges within communities, the
random walkers will
be trapped and spend a longer time inside communities.
Infomap further improved
the early implementations of the dynamics based algorithms by using information theory to define the most
parsimonious way to describe graph community structure.
Infomap is especially effective when applied to
directed networks, where it can identify communities that would not be detected by modularity optimisation
algorithms.
