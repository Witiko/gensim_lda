Abstract.
One of the key aspects of the United States democracy is free
and fair elections that allow for a peaceful
transfer of
power from one
President to the next. The 2016 US presidential election stands out due
to suspected foreign influence before,
during,
and after the election.
A
significant portion of that suspected influence was carried out via social
media. In this paper, we look specifically at 3,500 Facebook ads allegedly
purchased by the Russian government. These ads were released on May
10, 2018 by the US Congress House Intelligence Committee. We analyzed
the ads using natural
language processing techniques to determine tex-
tual
and semantic features associated with the most effective ones.
We
clustered the ads over time into the various campaigns and the labeled
parties associated with them.
We also studied the effectiveness of
Ads
on an individual, campaign and party basis. The most effective ads tend
to have less positive sentiment,
focus on past events and are more spe-
cific and personalized in nature. The more effective campaigns also show
such similar characteristics. The campaigns’ duration and promotion of
the Ads suggest a desire to sow division rather than sway the election.

Introduction
One of the key aspects of the United States democracy is free and fair elections,
unhindered by foreign influence, that allow for a peaceful transfer of power from
one President to the next. Campaign Finance laws forbid foreign governments or
individuals from participating or influencing the election. The 2016 US presiden-
tial election stands out not only due to its political outsider winner, Donald J.
Trump,
but also due to suspected foreign influence before and during the elec-
tion.
It is alleged that the Russian Federation operated the Main Intelligence
Directorate of the General
Staff,
a military intelligence agency.
This agency is
suspected of influencing the election with resources allocated towards social me-
dia on a variety of forums.
Corporate leadership and council from Google, Twitter, and Facebook testi-
fied on November 1, 2017 to the Senate Intelligence Committee concerning social
media influence on their platforms. While Facebook’s General Council suggested
that it would be difficult to verify that every ad purchased on their platform ad-
heres to US campaign finance laws, intuitively ads purchased in Russian Rubles

would be highly suspicious.
There were approximately 3,500 ads identified by
Facebook that met such criteria totaling close to $100K and purchased between
June 2015 and August 2017.
The surfacing of
these ads contributed to Face-
book’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony of 10-11 April
2018 to a number of
Senate and House Committees.
3
Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee,
had voiced his opinion that the Russians had launched an ‘independent expen-
diture campaign on Trump’s behalf, regardless of his involvement.
4
However, as
emphatically stated by Rob Goldman,
5
the vice president of ads at Facebook, the
over-arching aim of the advertisements was to bring about discord among differ-
ent communities in the United States. In Goldman’s words, “(the ads) sought to
sow division and discord” in the political
proceedings before,
during,
and after
the 2016 US elections by leveraging the freedom of
free speech and pervasive
nature of
social
media.
This statement is contradictory to the claim that the
primary objective of the advertisements was to influence the effect of the 2016
elections and sway it in favor of Trump or to vilify Clinton. Under the direction
of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee,
the Russian Facebook ads
were released to the public on May 10, 2018. The main objective of this work is
to apply language analysis and machine learning techniques to understand the
intent of those ads by exploring their effectiveness from a campaign perspective.

Related Literature
Since the early 2000s, there has been increasing research in the new domain of
computational social science [21]. Most of the literature has focused on networked
influence, information (or misinformation) diffusion, and social media association
with real-world events [16].
As it concerns our research efforts,
related work
focuses on social media use in politics as well as campaign detection.
Politics in Social
Media:
Concerning divisive issue campaigns on Face-
book,
ongoing work has explored the organizations and objectives behind the
Russian ads from a political
communication standpoint.
Kim [19]
stated that
suspicious groups which could include foreign entities are behind many of
the
divisive campaigns.
Additionally,
approximately 18% of
the suspicious groups
were Russian.
The authors asserts that there are shortcomings in federal
reg-
ulations and aspects of digital
media that allow for anonymous groups to sow
division [19]. While Kim approaches the issue from a policy perspective, we fo-
cus more on the effectiveness and organization of the ads themselves. While the
data we used in this research is specific to only the Russian Facebook ads,
we
present a methodology that could be extended to automatically sort any ads into

their divisive campaigns. Previous work established that social media platforms
were exploited during the 2016 US Presidential
Election [4,1,39,2],
as well
as
numerous other elections [28,24,17,12,9,34]
and other real-world events [11,13],
by using tools like bots and trolls [14,8,37].
Campaign Detection: In order to combat misinformation,
it is necessary
to understand the characteristics that allow it to be effective [23]. In addition to
misinformation,
divisive information which creates polarized groups is counter
to what the political system or a democratic nation needs to thrive [35]. Previous
campaign detection has been focused on spam [10] and malware [33,20] in order
to protect computer information systems. The most relevant work for campaign
detection on social
media is by Varol
and collaborators [38,15].
They use su-
pervised learning to categorize Twitter memes from millions of tweets across a
series of hashtags. In comparison to that work, we focus at the microscopic level
on paid Facebook ads determined to be from the same source.
In addition to
looking at the Russian campaign messaging and content,
we are able to factor
cost and effectiveness into our analysis.

The Data
3.1
Collection
The dataset comprises 3,516 advertisements with 22 variables as released by
the Data for Democracy organization in csv format.
6
The data was released
under the direction of the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. The
ads were released to the public on May 10,
2018.
The ads were purchased in
Russian Rubles during the 2016 US Presidential election and beyond from June
2015 to August 2017.
In analyzing effectiveness,
we only considered ads which
were viewed by at least one person (impressions greater than zero). In analyzing
campaigns, all ads with non-zero impressions or those which were purchased in
Rubles were considered. Our dataset consists of the Russian Facebook paid ads
totaling $93K.
Again,
the data was initially provided by Facebook,
so there is
no way to independently verify its completeness and ads purchased in Rubles
would be a lower bound to all ads purchased on behalf of the broader operation.
Summary statistics of the data are shown in Table 1.

Preliminary Data Analysis
Clicks and Impression counts: Clicks and impressions are important metrics
to understand the outreach and efficacy of
the advertisement.
Clicks,
or link
clicks, quantify the number of people who have clicked on the ad and was redi-
rected to the particular landing-page.
Impressions refer to the total
number of
times the advertisement has been shown.
It differs from Reach which reflects
instead the number of individual people who have seen the ad. We present the
distribution of impressions and clicks for the FB ads in 1a and 1,
respectively.
It is clearly evident that a majority of
ads have attained sufficient outreach
and popularity.
We observe that a huge fraction of the ads are targeted to the
younger age group as seen in 1c.

Research Framework and Research Questions
In this paper, we define our research framework tackling the following problem:
Research Question: What features are associated with the engagement of the
Russian Facebook ads and what was their impact (i.e., how effective were they)
at a campaign-wise (operational ), and on a party-wise (strategic) basis?
To operationalize this question we split it into three sub-parts:
1. What features are associated with the engagement of the Russian Facebook ads.
Definition of engagement: To quantify engagement, we estimate how likely a
person would respond to an ad when it is shown to them. The metric we use is
Click-Through Rate (CTR). We approach the problem by classifying ads which
have non-zero impressions in two groups, namely more effective and less effective
ads.
The classification is done using a decision rule where the median value of
the CTR across all ads is the threshold. We consider non-zero impressions only
since we cannot evaluate the effectiveness of an ad that was not seen.
We then analyze the stylistic and textual
features of
the Ads between the
two categories, using different natural language processing techniques. The fea-
tures include sentiment,
emotion,
structural
content,
parts of
speech distribu-
tion, named entity distribution, and linguistic categories. We note those features
which show significant differences across categories.

2.
What
was the Ads impact
(effectiveness) at
a campaign-wise (operational)
level? Definition of effectiveness: At the campaign level we define effective-
ness as the audience reach efficacy.
The metric we use is Cost Per Thousand
Impressions (CPM) and Cost Per Click (CPC) (explained in methodology). We
approach this question by clustering the ads into the various campaigns and
using CPM to determine the most and least effective campaigns as well as any
insights from the associated features mentioned in the first sub-part.
3.
What
was the Ads impact
(effectiveness) at
a party-wise (strategic) level?
Definition of effectiveness: We define the effectiveness at the party level by
observing significant differences in terms of CTR, CPM and total cost between
the parties.
We create parties by manually labeling the ads into Democratic
(Blue),
Republican (Red) and Neutral
(Green).
We exclude the Neutral
cam-
paigns and assess the effectiveness of the Blue and Red parties and report any
significant findings from a feature-wise perspective.
It is notable to mention our assumption that all of these ads within the cam-
paigns and parties were generated by the same alleged organization in Russia.

Methodology
5.1
Features of Effective Ads
The effectiveness of ads at the individual level is measured using CTR.
Click-Through Rate (CTR).
CTR of
a particular advertisement is the
ratio of clicks to impression for the ad expressed as a percentage. CTR reflects
the creativity and compelling nature of the advertisement [7].
CTR =
#Clicks
#Impressions
∗ 100(%)
(1)
The stylistic and textual features associated with the ads we analyzed are:
Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis helps to identify the attitude of
the text and gauge whether it is more positive, negative or neutral. Based on the
comparative analysis of
in [30],
we utilized 2 methods to determine sentiment
on the Ad text to obtain the overall
compounded sentiment score of
the Ad.
VADER: Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning [18] is a rule-based
sentiment model that has both a dictionary and associated intensity measures.
Its dictionary has been tuned for micro-blog like contexts. We also observe the
categories corresponding to positive and negative emotions by performing LIWC
[27] analysis on the Ad Text.
Emotion Analysis: We leverage the NRC lexicon of
[26]
to calculate the
average number of words corresponding to an emotion per advertisement.
The
associated 8 emotions include anger, anticipation, joy, fear, trust, disgust, sadness
and surprise.

Fig. 2: Emotion word counts
Structural
Content: The structural
content of the text refers to the dis-
tribution of
sentences and words
per advertisement.
An ad’s efficiency often
correlates with the amount of textual content [31].
POS-TAG distribution: We employed the inbuilt Part-of-Speech (POS)
tagger of NLTK [36]
and the Penn Tree Bank
7
to observe the distribution of
different POS (Parts of Speech) TAGS in the advertisement texts.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) distribution: The high proportion
of proper nouns from POS TAG analysis signifies that the ads cater more to real-
world events. Consequently, we also inspected the distribution of different named
entities using the Perceptron-based NER of Stanford CoreNLP [22]
pertaining
to ”PERSON”, ”ORGANIZATION” and ”LOCATION”.
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) Analysis:
LIWC [27]
computes the proportion of words in psychologically meaningful
categories for
the analyzed text which we leverage to discover different linguistic and cognitive
dimensions.
5.2
Campaign-Level Analysis
We leverage different methods to cluster Ads into non-overlapping campaigns:
LDA Topic extraction: We implemented LDA [5] (Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation) using the in-built gensim model
of [29]
on the corpus of advertisement
text to obtain a list of 50 topics.
However these topics had several
overlapping
words and dealt with racism, gun-control or police accountability. It also failed
to capture broad topics like homosexuality or immigration.
Key-word/ Key-phrase extraction: We also employ RAKE (Rapid Au-
tomatic Keyword Extraction) [32],
an unsupervised,
domain-independent and
language-independent
technique to extract
keywords from the advertisement

7
texts.
This methodology captures niche topics since it observes each document
individually.
However,
the above methods suffer two shortcomings.
Firstly,
they did not
take into account the Ad’s images which serves the purpose of propagating ideas
mentioned in the advertisement.
Secondly,
these techniques do not incorporate
the context associated outside of the text. For example, the ad text, ”The blue
gang is free to do whatever they want” clearly refers to police brutality,
often
misdirected at African-Americans, but it is impossible to decipher from the text
alone.
Hence we resort to a semi-automated network clustering technique to
identify campaigns as described below.
Network-based Clustering: Some of the advertisements have a meta-data
field labeled Interests which corresponds to topics.
We represent each topic as
a vector,
obtained by the FastText technique of
[25].
We compute similarity
between the topics using the given equation:
sim(T
i
, T
j
) = α(T
i
· T
j
) + (1 − α)
|Ads(T
i
) ∩ Ads(T
j
)|
min(|Ads(T
i
)|, |Ads(T
j
)|)
(2)
wherein,
T
i
and T
j
represent two arbitrary topics,
T
i
and T
j
denote their
vector representation and Ads(T
i
) enlists the ads which have T
i
as a topic.
The first part of
the equation (T
i
· T
j
) simply computes the cosine similarity
score of the topic vectors, while the second part calculates the overlap coefficient
similarity between two topics. While α  [0,1] determines the trade-off between
the two similarity scores.
Each topic is then represented as a node in an undirected graph with edges
representing the similarity between two topics. We binarize the graph by retain-
ing only the edges above a certain threshold β and cluster it. We experimented
with different values of α, β and different algorithms and experimentally verified
that the Louvain algorithm [6]
with a threshold of
0.9 for both α and β gave
the best results with 9 non-overlapping campaigns. A change in α and β values
drastically altered the number of communities, ranging from 2-3 on one extreme
to 40-50 in another. Likewise, ML based unsupervised clustering techniques like
KMeans or Spectral Clustering were unable to incorporate the overlap coefficient
similarity and hence showed poorer performance.
Thus each topic belongs to one of the initial
9 campaigns.
Since an ad can
contain several
topics,
they can belong to different campaigns,
we assign them
to the campaign that with the most number of topics, breaking ties arbitrarily.
We then manually inspected the rest of
the ads and assigned those which
did not have the Interests field to one of the 9 campaigns.
Sometimes,
we had
to create new campaigns since the particular Ad did not conform with any
of
the previous ones.
It was necessary to break up large clusters which had
similar notions (police brutality,
racism and Black Lives Matter) into different
campaigns. Eventually, that yielded the final 21 campaigns as demonstrated in
Table 2.
The effectiveness of ads at the campaign level is measured via CPM and CPC.
8
Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM):
CPM for an ad is simply
the amount of
Rubles spent to reach a mile (thousand impressions).
CPM is
primarily determined by the target audience [3].
CPM =
AdCost(RUB)
#Impressions
∗ 1000
(3)
Cost Per Click (CPC): CPC for an Ad is the amount of Rubles required
to receive a click.
CPC reflects the traffic generated by the ad to the landing
page [3].
CPC =
AdCost(RUB)
#Clicks
(4)
A campaign’s effectiveness is usually measured by a low CPC value because
it implies that the amount of Rubles required to get an audience’s response is
also less.
However a low CPM is sometimes essential
if one wishes to target a
particular audience and optimize the overall cost of the campaign. If an ad itself
has a high CTR, purchasing Ads using CPM may be a better strategy.
The stylistic features analyzed are consistent with those outlined in Section 5.1.
5.3
Party Clustering
The campaigns are manually assigned to parties as stated in Table 2.

Results
6.1
Ad Effectiveness in Aggregate
The calculated median CTR value of the advertisements is 10.24. Consequently,
we categorize the ads as more or less effective if
the CTR value is greater or
lesser than 10.243 respectively. We present the significant semantic and textual
features here. In all cases, significant difference refers to a p-value of ≤ 0.001.
Sentiment Analysis:
We observe that the overall
compounded score is
significantly lower for the more effective ads than those in the less effective ads,
implying that the former ads tend to be less positive.
Surprisingly,
there is no
significant difference between the distribution of negative sentiments.
Emotion Analysis: None of the 8 emotions showed any significance differ-
ence across the two categories, except surprise which demonstrated mild signifi-
cance (p-value ≤ 0.05).
Structural content: The distribution of sentences and words per advertise-
ment do not vary significantly across the two categories.
POS-TAG distribution:We observe that
adverbs (RB)
and past
tense
verbs (VBD) occur more frequently in the more effective ads. This implies that
more effective ads tend to refer to past events more frequently while the pro-
nounced usage of adverbs implies that actions are explained in detail. However,
the proportion of nouns across advertisements is very high,
with NN (common
nouns, singular) and NNP (proper nouns, singular) accounting for 6.32 and 5.89
words per advertisement respectively.
NER distribution: The NER analysis revealed that the category ”PER-
SON” occurred in significantly higher proportion among the more effective ads.
LIWC Analysis:
Only the most significant LIWC categories have been
taken to account here.
Personalization:
Categories belonging to SheHe and Ipron (personal
pro-
nouns) are higher in more effective ads, while those belonging to We and Friends
are lower in the more effective category.
This indicates the more effective ads
are more personalized or cater to the individuals rather than the communities.
Religion and Money:
Religion and Money occur in lower proportions in
the more effective ads than the less effective ones.
This shows that religious or
financial divide are not as successful to ensure engagement.
We now present the differences in Table 3.
The columns corresponding to
Less Effective(Mean) and More Effective(Mean) specify the mean value of the
distribution for the categories. The Mean Diff column is simply computed
MeanDiff =
High(Mean) − Low(Mean)
Low(Mean)

Campaign-wise Analysis
We present the statistics of the different campaigns in Table 4 which are arranged
in decreasing order of their effectiveness and thus in increasing order of CPM.
We demarcate the campaigns into more and less effective based on the median
value of the CPM (A more effective campaign has a CPM score less than 277.57).
We note the following stylistic differences between the more effective and less
effective campaigns.
Sentiment Analysis: The compounded sentiment score is significantly lower
for the more effective campaigns since those campaigns involve serious topics like
police brutality, racism, etc.
Emotion Analysis:
All
8 emotions,
barring surprise,
are observed to be
significantly pronounced in the more effective campaigns.
We hypothesize that
ads evoking emotions are likely to be shared more and hence the impressions
increase for the ad, thereby decreasing the potential CPM.
Structural
Analysis: Surprisingly,
we note that ads in the more effective
campaigns tend to be of shorter length, i.e more concise.
POS-TAG distribution: POS corresponding to adverbs (RB), plural nouns
(NNS,
NNPS) and verbs (VB) occur more frequently in the less effective cam-
paigns, the significance of which is unknown.
Named Entity distribution:
Named entity mentions corresponding to
’PERSON’
is significantly higher in the more effective campaigns while ’LO-
CATION’ is higher in the less effective ones. This finding is attributed to dispro-
portionate large mentions of victims of racial prejudice in the more effective cam-

paigns.
Likewise,
the less effective campaigns include Texas,
Anti-Immigration
to US, Veterans, etc which directly reference America.
LIWC Analysis: In the category of Religion,
the less effective campaigns
have a higher proportion of ads associated with Islam. This conforms the analysis
at the individual ad level that religious ads are less effective. As for Associativ-
ity,
the more effective campaigns are also individualistic/personal
as opposed
to community-driven.
This finding is substantiated by the significantly high
frequency of
I
and We categories respectively in the more and less effective
campaigns.
We also observe that the individual
CPM and cost spent on an ad is sig-
nificantly lower for the more effective campaigns than the less effective ones.
Likewise,
the number of
clicks and CTR of
an individual
Ad is significantly
higher for the more effective campaigns. Thus, more effective ads do contribute
to effective campaigns, although the effectiveness metrics themselves are different
for the parties and campaigns.

Party-wise Analysis
We present a statistical overview of the ads of the two parties in Table 5.

Table 5: Performance of the two parties.
Although there is no significant difference in the distribution of
clicks and
impressions between the Ads of the two parties, the Democratic party had sig-
nificantly higher CTR and lower CPM values. This implies that the Democratic
party was more effective amongst the two parties.
12
However, there was also an active involvement in propagating the Republican
Ads as well.
This is evident from Table 5 which highlights that the dispropor-
tionate high amount spent for the Republican Ads (38.87%) despite their low
frequency (17.10%). Moreover, adjudging from the campaign’s time-line in Fig-
ure 5 Republican Ads occurred for a longer duration.
Finally, the campaigns of the two parties mostly dealt with conflicting or con-
tradictory ideals (Anti-Islam/Islam,
Anti-Immigration/Immigration,
All
Lives
Matter/Black Lives Matter). This strongly suggests desire to sow discord.
We now present the semantic and textual differences between the two parties.
Sentiment Analysis: The compounded sentiment score is significantly lower
for the Democratic party since a majority of the Democratic ads pertain to se-
rious topics like police brutality, racial tension, anti-war, etc.
Emotion Analysis: The emotion corresponding to sadness is significantly
more pronounced in the Democratic ads due to the above reason.
Structural
Analysis:
There was no significant difference in the average
distribution of words and sentences between the two parties.
POS-TAG distribution:
Surprisingly,
plural
nouns (both common and
proper nouns) occur more frequently in the ads of
the Republican party.
Ad-
verbs and comparative adjectives are also more prevalent in the Republican ads.
Named Entity distribution: The fraction of named entities corresponding
to Person is higher in Democratic ads while those corresponding to Location is
higher in Republican ads.
This happens since the Democratic ads mention the
names of victims of racial prejudice like Tamir Rice and Eric Garner. Republican
ads of patriotism, veterans, and 2nd Amendment indirectly referenced America.
LIWC Analysis: The category We is more significantly pronounced in the
Republican party than the Democratic party which might indicate a closer com-
munity or inclusiveness. This may be appealing to the target’s sense of belonging.

Conclusions and Future work
In this paper we characterized the Russian Facebook influence operation that
occurred before, during, and after the 2016 US presidential election. We focused
on 3,500 ads allegedly purchased by the Russian government, highlighting their
features and studying their effectiveness. The most effective ads tend to have less
positive sentiment, focused on past events and are more specific and personalized
in nature.
A similar observation holds true for the more effective campaigns.
The ads were predominately biased toward the Democratic party as opposed to
the Republican party in terms of frequency and effectiveness.
Nevertheless the
campaigns’ duration and promotion of the Republican Ads do hint at the efforts
of
the Russians to cause divide along racial,
religious and political
ideologies.
Areas for future work include exploring other platforms and similar operations
carried therein.
For example,
we would like to investigate the connection to
Russian troll accounts identified on Twitter, and conduct campaign analysis to
determine the effectiveness of such operations across various platforms.
