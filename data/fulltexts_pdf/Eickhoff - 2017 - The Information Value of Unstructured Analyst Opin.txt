Foundations 
In the first part of this cumulative thesis, the foundations relevant to the individual 
research contributions presented in part B are developed. This includes the motivation 
of the presented research, the development of research questions, and an overview of 
the relevant literature, theories, methods, as well as the data used throughout this the-
sis. See section 3 for a detailed overview of the structure of this thesis.

Motivation 
The role of information and communication technology (ICT) in the financial industry 
has recently undergone a fundamental evolution. Traditionally, computer systems 
served as a method of data storage intended to support firms’ ongoing operations. As 
digital technologies evolve, ICT’s functions shift towards a more active role in the 
firm. Two examples of this shift in the financial industry are given by the sector’s 
recent interest in block chain-based distributed databases (Cohen et al., 2016) and the 
adoption of digital business strategies
by incumbent financial industry firms, which 
intended to react to new technology-based competitors (Sia et al., 2016). 
These changes impact many aspects of the business processes of financial market par-
ticipants. This thesis focuses on the increased need for decision support that this chang-
ing role of ICT entails. Again, this need for decision support concerns many facets of 
a bank’s business. One of these facets is given by the increased data volume resulting 
from the adoption of digital technologies. While this increase in available data creates 
opportunities for industries (Chen et al., 2012) and research (Rai, 2016), it also creates 
new challenges for decision makers. This is particularly true when copious quantities 
of unstructured, often textual, data become decision relevant. A growing body of re-
search shows the relevance of this content type regarding investment decisions (Bollen 
et al., 2011; Li, 2010b; Nofer and Hinz, 2015). 
Stock analysts play a significant role in information dissemination in financial mar-
kets. The analysis of their recommendations (Brown and Rozeff, 1978) and market 
forecasts in general (Cowles 1933) have a long tradition in financial research. More 
recently, the information content of the unstructured content of analyst reports (As-
quith et al., 2005; Frankel et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2015), as well as analyst confer-
ence calls accompanying earnings announcements (Mayew et al., 2013), have been 
studied since these forms of analyst opinion became widely available. Thus, this re-
search stream depends on content analysis methodology to extract metrics from this 
unstructured content. The focus in this thesis is given by quantitative content analysis 
using computational methods, in contrast to manual content analysis techniques such 
as hermeneutics or grounded theory. 
Quantitative content analysis predates the development of the first computational sys-
tems (Speed, 1893), and it has always been a subject of interest when the development 
of business intelligence systems was concerned. Indeed, Luhn (1958), to whom origi-
nating the term business intelligence is commonly ascribed, refers to the auto abstract-
ing and auto-encoding of documents as two of the key tasks of business intelligence 
systems. 
Foundations 
2 
The ever-increasing volumes of available data and the resulting need for approaches 
to its analysis have led to the development of many sub tasks within the content anal-
ysis domain, solutions to which may be used in decision support systems aimed at 
coping with this increased demand for data analysis. In this thesis, topic modeling 
(Blei, 2012) and sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012) are of special interest because these 
methods attempt to extract what is being said and how it is said. Thus, it is useful to 
quantify analyst opinion in unstructured data. This thesis builds on the intersection of 
these financial and methodological research streams. It investigates the drivers of this 
relevance based on information systems theory and contributes in three principal ways. 
This is done first by providing an overview of the business models of FinTech compa-
nies, which helps to explain the changing environment financial markets operate 
within. Second, this research surveys the available research methodology in infor-
mation systems and other technical disciplines and compares this state of the art with 
the methodology currently being applied in financial research. Opportunities for the 
application of content analysis techniques are identified in the financial domain and 
explored in the presented studies. Third, information systems theory is applied to the 
financial domain to search for explanations for the usefulness of unstructured content 
in the context of investment decisions. 
These contributions are cumulative. The main area of this investigation is given by the 
analysis of unstructured analyst opinion and its information value, supported by an 
analysis of the changing entrepreneurial landscape and methodological contributions 
that establish the necessary overview of content analysis techniques relevant to the 
conducted research. The next section provides a more detailed overview of these re-
search areas and develops the individual research questions, which are addressed in 
the individual contributions of this cumulative thesis.

Research Questions 
The research questions of this thesis are separated into three principal areas of research. 
This section provides a brief introduction to the aims of each of these three areas and 
consequently derives the research questions for these areas. 
The first area of interest concerns the entrepreneurial surroundings within which ana-
lysts work. Recently, the financial industry has undergone substantial transformation 
due to the ubiquity of digital technology, which has impacted not only the financial 
sector but all areas of entrepreneurial activity (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; El Sawy and 
Pereira, 2013). How this transformation is impacting the financial industry and the 
business models of this sector is crucial to understanding the impact of analyst opinion. 
This digitization of the financial industry has fundamentally changed the creation and 
reception of analysts’ information output. The increase in the means of automation of 
analysts’ workflows and the analysis of their work are of interest when considering the 
changes within this area of activity. This is why Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
) in-
vestigate this transformation of the financial industry by developing a taxonomy of 
digital business models for FinTech startups. This taxonomy enables readers to assess 
the degree to which ubiquitous digital technologies have changed the competitive land-
scape within the financial industry by highlighting the threat that such startups pose to 
incumbent firms. In this context, the first research area of this thesis is proposed. 
Research Area I:
This research area is concerned with establishing an overview of 
the entrepreneurial environment, in which the results of the other two research areas 
are to be understood. It introduces the entrepreneurial environment and the changing 
technological landscape, which have made it necessary to find innovative ways to an-
alyze data and to remain competitive with increasingly diverse competitors and new 
analytical demands. The development of a business model taxonomy will show 
whether analytical business models have gained traction in this industry. This research 
area answers the following individual research questions: 
Research Question I.1: 
What are the dimensions and characteristics of typical 
business models of FinTech companies? 
Research Question I.2: 
How can these business models be grouped into dif-
ferent FinTech niche markets? 
After an overview of the entrepreneurial landscape has been provided by the answers 
to the research questions posed in research area I, the next logical step towards the 
analysis of unstructured data within the financial domain is to determine which tools 
are available to support this task. First, text mining methods are needed to extract in-
formation from textual data in a format suitable for further analysis. Second, because 
the result of text mining methodology is typically given by a large quantity of numeric 
Foundations 
4 
data, the information extracted by these methods needs to be analyzed in a manner that 
provides decision-relevant metrics to decision makers, thus creating a result that is 
useful. Therefore, research area II addresses these methodological questions. 
Research Area II:
By what methodology can the information within unstructured 
content related to capital markets be transformed to be analyzed by traditional statisti-
cal methods, and how are these methods currently used in managerial research disci-
plines to provide meaningful answers to research questions that are relevant in these 
disciplines? This research section answers the following individual research questions, 
focusing on the roles of topic modeling and sentiment analysis: 
Research Question II.1:
What is the state of the art of topic mining method-
ology used to process unstructured content in the methodological literature, 
and how are these methods being applied in the managerial sciences to pro-
vide meaningful information relevant to researchers and decision makers? 
Research Question II.2:
How can dictionary-based and machine learning-
based sentiment analysis be combined to mitigate some of their individual 
shortcomings, such as the need for labeled training data? 
Thus, the output of research area two is constituted by deciding how to apply text 
mining methodology for the purposes of this thesis. When conducting text mining-
based research, this typically constitutes the first half of the analysis. The second part 
of the analysis is to put the results of the textual analysis to use and produce infor-
mation, based on which questions can be answered or which are useful to decision 
makers. Consequently, the third research area addresses the analysis of this infor-
mation, deriving decision-relevant metrics on its basis and answering questions about 
the information flow between unstructured business communications and the financial 
markets. 
Research Area III:
Based on the results of area II, how can unstructured analyst opin-
ion be analyzed in an informative manner? This research area is concerned both with 
the processing of unstructured analyst opinion and other information sources related 
to capital markets, as well as the impact these different media types have on individual 
companies. This area of research also examines how information systems and business 
administration theory can be applied to these problems to provide explanations as to 
why such effects exist. This research area answers the following individual research 
questions: 
Research Question III.1:
What structure is there to the relationship be-
tween the opinions of social media users and stock analysts, and can wisdom 
of crowds theory be used to identify the situations in which the crowd or 
Foundations 
5 
stock analysts are more likely to provide timely information, reflecting 
changes in a firm’s circumstance? 
Research Question III.2:
What constitutes a decision-relevant metric in the 
context of business communications regarding a firm’s earnings announce-
ment, and how can the metrics of analyst opinion determined by sentiment 
analysis and topic modeling be used to provide such decision relevant infor-
mation? 
Research Question III.3:
To what extent do the topics contained in analyst 
reports that are released prior to an earnings call influence the topics con-
tained therein, and does the call influence the content of reports released 
thereafter? 
Research Question III.4:
To what extent can the media richness of unstruc-
tured analyst opinion, as described by media richness theory, help to explain 
its effect on post earnings call firm stock returns when compared to infor-
mation sources of lower richness?
Thus, the three areas of research explored in the context of this thesis are given by first 
providing an overview of the context within which this research is conducted, followed 
by establishing the necessary methodological foundations regarding the analysis of 
unstructured data, and finally by using the results of these methods to investigate ques-
tions of theoretical or practical importance. The next section provides an overview of 
the thesis’ structure based on these research areas.

3.1
Part A: Foundations 
As shown in Figure 1, the foundational part of this thesis continues to outline the re-
search background of the presented results after this overview of the thesis’ structure. 
This is done by first providing a brief overview of the theories, which are relevant to 
the results presented here. Crowd wisdom theory, media richness theory, and a struc-
tured decision making process and its relationship to the phenomenon of information 
overload are discussed. Afterwards, the most important methods used throughout the 
different research contributions are introduced. This section focuses on the text mining 
methods used to process analyst opinion and social media data throughout the thesis, 
event studies, as well as literature reviews and taxonomy development. In turn, the 
datasets used throughout this thesis are presented and their individual characteristics 
are elaborated upon. Finally, behavioral science and design science are introduced be-
cause these two research paradigms constitute the theoretical underpinnings of the re-
search design of this thesis. 
3.2
Part B: Research Areas 
As noted, the contributions included in this thesis concern three different areas of re-
search, each of which is needed to develop a well-rounded impression of the market 
reaction to analyst opinion. Table 1 provides an overview of the individual research 
contributions, their research paradigms, and main contributions. The remainder of this 
section discusses how each paper is situated within its respective research area. 
Research Area I – Managerial Environment: 
The first research area concerns the 
entrepreneurial environment within which this thesis is situated. Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
) develops a taxonomy for FinTech business models and provides a thematic 
introduction to the changing landscape of business models in the financial industry.
Research Area II – Methodological: 
The second area of interest is given by the meth-
odological foundations needed for the analysis of textual analyst opinion. In Eickhoff 
(2015, 
paper II.1
), a framework for sentiment analysis using a hybrid method incor-
porating word lists and machine learning-based sentiment classification is developed. 
In Eickhoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.2
), a literature review of the topic modeling 
methodology and its use in information systems research and other managerial disci-
plines is conducted. 
Foundations 
8 
Research Area III – Analyst Opinion: 
Finally, the third area of interest and the main 
theme of this thesis is presented by the analysis of analyst opinion throughout various 
media types and its effect on the stock market, as well as the comparison between 
analysts’ opinion and other media types. Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b, 
paper 
III.1
) uses crowd wisdom theory to analyze the relationship between social media con-
tent and analyst opinion. This paper is an extension of the results presented in Eickhoff 
and Muntermann (2015). Eickhoff and Muntermann (2017, 
paper III.2
) provide an 
approach to the analysis of topics contained in analyst reports and earnings conference 
calls, supporting decision makers in financial markets by reducing the complexity of 
these unstructured data sources. This paper is an extension of the results and the ap-
proach of Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016a). Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016c, 
pa-
per III.3
) investigate the topic relationship between earnings conference calls between 
stock analysts and company representatives, and analyst reports. Finally, Eickhoff 
(2017, 
paper III.4
) uses media richness theory to provide explanations for differences

contributions based on extant literature and provides an overview of the different the-

4.1
The Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
The information value of analyst estimates regarding the future development of the 
stock market is a long-standing research topic. Starting with the early work of Cowles 
(1933), who evaluate estimates on future stock returns, this research has been critical 
regarding the information value of such estimates. 
This criticism is unsurprising and was later supported by the development of the effi-
cient market hypothesis (Dimson and Mussavian, 1998; Malkiel and Fama, 1970), 
which suggests that such estimates cannot consistently outperform the market unless 
they are based on private information because all public information is to be quickly 
incorporated in the current stock price. 
However, not all analyst research attempts to predict the future valuation of a firm. 
Instead, Bradshaw (2009) proposes the information processing model outlined in Fig-
ure 2. As shown, analysts rely on the forecasting of future financial reports to arrive at 
firm valuations to be able to react in case their estimate of the future firm value 
changes. It is important to note that this is not based on confidential information but 
only on public knowledge. Thus, the only possible value of such analyst research is 
given by either being quicker than other market participants regarding the speed of this 
process or having developed more accurate models for future firm performance, which 
make an individual analyst’s estimate more accurate than others. Naturally, the market 
for analyst opinion is competitive, and no single analyst or firm can be expected to be 
the fastest or provide the most accurate recommendation consistently. Consequently, 
research assessing the information value of analyst opinion can focus on determining 
the circumstances under which analyst recommendations are valuable.

There are two ways in which this can be done. First, individual analysts can be com-
pared to one another to determine which analyst or firm provides the best estimates. 
Second, stock analysts can be compared to other sources of information to assess if 
analyst opinion creates complementary value beyond freely available information or 
to present the stock price at a given point in time. In both cases, the value of analyst 
opinion may also depend on the nature of the external event, which may change future 
firm performance. The research presented in the third research area of this thesis fo-
cuses on the second case and not on the assessment of individual analysts. 
The early study of financial analysts’ opinion focused on the accuracy of analysts’ 
forecasts in comparison to other forecasts, such as management forecasts (Brown et 
al., 1985), the superiority of analysts’ forecasts to purely time-series based forecasts 
(Brown and Rozeff, 1978), or their suitability as a replacement of older metrics for 
expected earnings (O'Brien, 1988). According to Brown et al. (1985), early research 
using analyst forecasts focused on five main areas overall (Brown et al., 1985, p. 1): 
1.
Properties of earnings forecasts by security analysts 
2.
Capital markets and security analyst earnings forecasts 
3.
Properties of earnings forecasts by management 
4.
Capital markets and management earnings forecasts 
5.
Benchmark comparisons of security analysts, management, and mechanical 
model earnings forecasts 
This area of research has adopted many new facets. For instance, earnings conference 
calls between firms and analysts have gained traction as a related field of interest. In 
this context, management discrimination regarding the possibility to ask questions in 
a call has been studied (Mayew, 2008). Additionally, intra-call returns have been stud-
ied (Matsumoto et al., 2011). These and earlier studies focused on the question of 
whether such calls mattered (Frankel et al., 1999; Tasker, 1997). On this basis, the 
study of analysts’ opinions has expanded beyond the analysis of structured analyst 
recommendations, such as the data available through the Institutional Broker Estimate 
System (
I/B/E/S
). 
The research presented in this cumulative thesis is built upon this background of re-
search regarding the role of analyst opinion on capital markets. This research focuses 
on the relationship between analyst opinion and the role of information systems in the 
context of their analysis. Thus, it combines theories and methods used in financial or 
accounting research, with those used in information systems research. Consequently, 
the aims and means of the presented research differ from those of research situated 
entirely in either domain individually, which is why the next sections give an overview 
of the theories and methods used throughout the individual contributions of this thesis.

Theoretical Background 
This section provides brief introductions to the theories that are most important to the 
individual research contributions of this thesis. For each theory, an overview of its 
main constructs is provided. 
4.2.1
Wisdom of Crowds 
The term Wisdom of Crowds describes the phenomenon in which groups often out-
perform experts, even if the individual estimations of the group members are inferior 
to the expert assessment. The study of this effect has a long history in the sciences. An 
early study regarding this phenomenon was conducted by Galton (1907), who found 
that median group estimates can outperform expert opinion. Surowiecki (2005) pro-
vides a high-level overview of this area of interest and proposes that the quality of a 
crowds’ assessment depends on the constructs shown in Figure 3, which shows the 
five constructs constituting the main themes of his view of the drivers of Crowd Wis-
dom. 
As shown, these relate to both the composition of the group and the characteristics of 
its individual members. Within this theoretical framework, diversity is perhaps the 
most crucial factor influencing a group performance because the overarching idea of 
diversity underlies the other crowd characteristics outlined in the figure. 
Increases in data availability and contexts, in which the effect can be observed, have 
enabled a resurgence of research in this area. Lorenz et al. (2011) study the negative 
impact of social influence on group decisions, Nofer and Hinz (2014) assess the per-
formance of stock prediction communities, and Chen et al. (2014) examine the value 
of stock predictions transmitted through social media. In this thesis, Eickhoff and Mun-
termann (2015) and the extended version by Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b,
paper 
III.1
) investigate ways to make these constructs measurable and compare social media 
users and stock analysts’ opinion evolution based on per-situation metrics.

4.2.2
Decision Making and Information Overload 
As discussed, the information value of stock analysts’ recommendations depends on 
their information processing capability. Likewise, the value readers derive from them 
constitutes another information processing task, which consists of using the available 
analyst research, along with other sources of information, to arrive at an investment 
decision. 
However, how do investors arrive at their investment decisions? Simon (1977) de-
scribes a general model for decision processes, which can help to structure this ques-
tion into distinct phases, making it easier to understand the process. In the context of 
this thesis, Figure 4 provides an overview of how this process integrates with invest-
ment decision making. The upper part of the figure (1) shows some of the information 
sources available regarding listed companies in the example of data sources used 
throughout this thesis, which are elaborated in section 4.4. The central part of the figure 
(2) shows the decision process itself, which consists of surveying the available infor-
mation and arriving at a problem statement, creating several potential solutions to the 
problem, and finally choosing from this pool of potential solutions and acting upon 
this alternative. Supporting decision makers in overcoming this problem has always 
been one of the main tasks of information systems. However, as noted by Simon 
(1976), information systems also contribute to this problem themselves.

Figure 4: 
Investment Decision Making. Investors assess the available information at 
any given point in time, as shown in the top part of figure (1). This process 
can be structured by the three phases of decision making proposed by Simon 
(1977), as shown in the middle part of figure (2). On this basis, an investment 
decision can be made (3). 
Foundations 
14 
These diverse sources of information can overwhelm the information processing ca-
pabilities of decision makers, especially when operating under time constraints, in 
which case information overload
can occur (Pennington and Tuttle, 2007). Due to the 
ever-increasing volume of digitally available information, the risk of information over-
load becomes more relevant as time progresses. 
Making investment decisions is made more difficult by the need to assess the quality 
of the information made available by analysts and other sources of information. In the 
case of analyst opinion, prior research suggests that stock analysts exhibit several in-
efficiencies, which may influence the quality of their analyses in any situation. For 
example, analysts tend to 
“stick to the herd”
by being careful to voice dissenting opin-
ions (Twedt and Rees, 2012). One reason for this behavior is the concern that an in-
correct opinion may have a negative impact on the future careers of analysts if the 
majority of their peers made a correct assessment in the same situation (Clement and 
Tse, 2005; Hong et al., 2000). Another reason is given by misguided incentive struc-
tures, which aim at increasing a firm’s brokerage or investment banking revenue in-
stead of rewarding analysts for the accuracy of their predictions (Groysberg et al., 
2011). Thus, the research presented in research area III focuses on the properties of 
different information sources in the context of investment decisions and how under-
standing these properties can help decision makers arrive at informed judgements. 
4.2.3
Media Richness Theory 
Media richness theory, or sometimes the information richness theory, as proposed by 
Daft and Lengel (1983), analyzes the properties of different media types to determine 
what media type is suited best for the transmission of a particular type of information 
or a specific circumstance of the intended transmission (Daft and Lengel, 1983; Daft 
and Lengel, 1986; Daft and Macintosh, 1981). In its context, richness refers to the 
overall complexity of the medium regarding its information transmission capabilities. 
It argues that information transmission is most effective when the complexity of the 
transmitted information and the complexity of the medium used to transmit it are 
aligned. As shown in Figure 5, media richness theory (MRT) uses four constructs to 
explain this richness:

based on Daft and Lengel (1983). 
Foundations

1.
Language variety (symbol variety)
refers to the number of different symbol 
types that a medium can transmit. Symbol types can, as the name suggests, be 
given by different human languages, but the idea of language variety exceeds 
this. High language variety also refers to the ability of the medium to transmit 
a wide spectrum of concepts and ideas. For instance, Daft and Lengel (1983) 
considers music to be a medium with high language variety. 
2.
Cue multiplicity (channel variety)
considers the number of simultaneous 
channels a medium uses to transmit information. For example, face-to-face 
communication involves many different channels such as facial expressions, 
the spoken text itself, and the posture of all people taking part in the conversa-
tion. 
3.
Personalization
concerns the extent to which a medium allows for messages 
to be customized for specific recipients. For example, a text written for children 
can be designed to be easier to understand than a technical document. 
4.
Feedback immediacy
is defined by how interactive a medium is. For example, 
the ability to ask questions by the recipient of the communication or the ability 
to correct wrong perceptions constitute high feedback immediacy. 
A medium is evaluated on the basis of these criteria and is consequently ranked on a 
low-richness to high-richness spectrum. Obviously, this is not a categorical assignment 
but rather a judgement call on a continuous scale of media richness. MRT considers 
two main problems that can inhibit effective communication (Daft and Lengel, 1986): 
1.
Equivocality
refers to a situation of information oversupply, in which a deci-
sion maker has access to conflicting sources of information, which make it 
difficult to discern what information is relevant. 
2.
Uncertainty
refers to a situation in which the decision maker has not been 
supplied with enough information to reach a decision. 
The relationship between these two problems and the media richness property is given 
by the mitigation of either problem based on the richness of a given media type. Within 
the scope of MRT, high richness media mitigates uncertainty, while low richness me-
dia mitigates equivocality.

Methods 
In the following sections, the main methods used in this thesis are presented. These 
sections are intended to be a brief introduction to each of these methods, with an em-
phasis on the practical applications of the methods and their individual strengths and 
limitations regarding the research goals of this thesis. 
4.3.1
Text Mining Pre-Processing 
As textual data are the basis for most of the presented analyses, this section gives a 
brief overview of the pre-processing needed to analyze such content. While the pre-
processing needed for the different content analysis techniques used throughout this 
thesis differs, it is useful to introduce the terminology used in this task on the example 
of a straightforward text. Figure 6 provides an overview of a basic pre-processing ap-
proach. As shown, pre-processing a text can be structured in five phases. First, the 
document is read from a file or database. 
Second, this text is split into separate pieces; in this case, the text is split directly into 
words. This step typically also removes non-word content, such as punctuation. Some 
of the literature also refers to these tokens as 
features
. What constitutes a token and 
what is filtered out at this stage of pre-processing depends on the needs of a given 
analysis. For example, emoticons may be of interest despite not being words. 
Third, 
stopwords
are removed. These are words such as “I” or “in” that are not ex-
pected to comprise the information content of a document. Fourth, the remaining 
words are reduced to their stems, which increases the likelihood of the same words 
appearing across multiple documents or words being matched with word lists. 
Finally, the remaining word stems are added to a term document matrix, which typi-
cally contains words from many documents. Often, this matrix is transformed to ac-
commodate term weighting schemes. 
A popular example is presented by 
term frequency – inverse document frequency
, 
where the individual occurrences of words are replaced by the proportion that a term 
contributes to an individual text and is weighted against the overall occurrence fre-
quency in the entire document corpus. This results in a measure for the abnormal por-
tion of a word’s importance.

Figure 6: 
Pre-processing of textual data. Plain text documents are pre-processed by 
creating separate tokens, removing uninformative words, reducing these 
words to word stems, and finally arranging the resulting features in a term-
document matrix along with other documents. 
As noted, the needs for pre-processing are determined by the intended analysis. For 
example, topic models may benefit from maintaining word order per text instead of 
relying on a bag-of-words approach; a dictionary-based sentiment analysis may benefit 
from the use of more advanced methods than a simple stemmer, such as determining 
parts of speech or finding different words with the same meaning (word sense disam-
biguation). Indeed, the different presented papers use different pre-processing logics, 
but the principle of generating a term document matrix containing the tokens generated 
for each particular text holds true for most text mining approaches. 
4.3.2
Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment analysis addresses extracting measures of authors’ opinions from unstruc-
tured textual data. Two popular basic approaches to this problem currently exist. First, 
a dictionary-based sentiment analysis uses pre-determined word lists to determine the 
sentiment value of a text. Second, a machine learning-based sentiment analysis uses 
classification algorithms trained on pre-classified texts. Figure 7 provides an overview 
of this approach using a positive and negative word list, which corresponds to the ap-
proach taken in the papers included in contribution group III. The figure shows ex-
cerpts from a positive and a negative word list and how a positivity score is calculated 
for three example documents based on the intersection between the documents and the 
two word lists. The first document (
D
1
) is classified as positive because more positive 
words are found in the document than negative ones. In contrast, the second document, 
(
D
2
) is classified as negative because more negative words are contained therein. Fi-
nally, D
5
is considered neutral because the document contains an equal amount of 
words contained in the two categories. 
Obviously, the success of this dictionary-based approach to sentiment analysis hinges 
upon the selection of a dictionary containing domain-appropriate words, which can 
help to represent authors’ sentiment regarding the subject matter of interest. Conse-
quently, many sentiment dictionaries for different domains have been developed. 
Within this thesis, two principle types of dictionaries are needed.

Depiction of dictionary-based sentiment calculation. Positivity score calcula-
tion based on a positive and a negative sentiment dictionary. For each text, 
the word co-occurrences with each category are determined. On this basis, a 
measure scaled to text-length is computed by dividing with the sum of all cat-
egory hits. One positive, one negative, and one neutral example is given. 
First, social media users’ opinions need to be analyzed. Second, stock analysts’ and 
other finance-oriented authors’ opinions are of interest. For financial content, the 10-
K dictionary (Loughran and McDonald, 2011), and a press release (Henry, 2008) dic-
tionary are used. For social media users’ opinion, the more general purpose Hu-Liu 
dictionary (Hu and Liu, 2004) and the valence categories from the General Inquirers 
dictionary — in its current version after the integration of 
Harvard IV-4
and 
Lasswell
categories — are used (Stone et al., 1966).
1
When a comparison between these two 
content types is desired, the latter type of dictionary is used because of the problems 
arising from the comparison between measures derived using different dictionaries, 
such as different proportions of positive and negative words. In contrast, machine 
learning-based sentiment analysis does not usually rely on such sentiment dictionaries 
but on a set of training documents. In the case of sentiment analysis, this set of training 
documents is usually assigned to categories by human coders. While there are a con-
siderable number of classification algorithms suited to this task, this prior labeling of 
training documents is perhaps the most crucial step in successful machine learning-
based sentiment analysis because any algorithm applied to this categorization task is 
limited by the quality of its training data.

No comprehensive published work is available that describes the current unified version 
of the General Inquirer dictionary. The best resource for information regarding this dic-
tionary is available online (GI-Team, 2002). 
Foundations 
19 
Overall, while sentiment analysis is usually performed at the document level, its results 
are most reliable when aggregated over a large number of documents to determine the 
average sentiment for a specific group of authors or a timeframe. This is because, re-
gardless of the chosen approach to sentiment analysis, these models are only accurate 
to a certain degree, which makes judgements on individual documents unreliable. 
Still, the choice of a suitable algorithm impacts both model accuracy and interpreta-
bility (Pang et al., 2002). In this thesis, machine learning-based sentiment analysis is 
only used in combination with dictionary-based techniques, which are used as a sub-
stitute for the manual coding of texts (Eickhoff, 2015, 
paper II.1
). In general, modern 
machine learning-based techniques can perform at accuracy and recall rates similar to 
human judgement (Sharma and Dey, 2012), but this performance comes at the cost of 
the need for per-corpus training data. 
4.3.3
Topic Modeling 
Topic modeling is a technique intended to extract the core themes discussed in a given 
document and have been developed with the intent of easing the browsing of document 
collections regarding such underlying topics (Blei, 2012). Early solutions to this task 
include a latent semantic analysis (Croft and Harper, 1979; Deerwester et al., 1990; 
Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and non-negative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 
2001). 
The topic modeling technique used throughout this thesis, introduced by Blei et al. 
(2003), is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and differs from these earlier ap-
proaches. It not only clusters documents regarding the topics contained in them but 
also provides 
topics
, which are intuitively interpretable by humans if introspection of 
the algorithmic results is desired. Another difference between LDA and other methods 
is given by the fact that for each document, more than one topic can be assigned. In 
fact, each document is represented as a mixture of underlying topics. This enables a 
more granular analysis of documents and is useful when using the topic assignments 
as regression variables in the studies in research area III of this thesis. Figure 8 shows 
how the model assigns words to topics and in turn assigns these topics to the docu-
ments in the document collection. 
This two-stage approach to topic modeling enables the interpretation of both word to 
topic and topic to document assignments. Word to topic assignments can be used to 
interpret the meaning of the topics and are often used to assign labels to topics, while 
topic to document assignments can help to clarify which document in a collection con-
tains content that is relevant to each of these labels.

Figure 8: 
Overview of LDA model components. The figure shows the relationships be-
tween words, topics and documents in a corpus of M documents, K topics in 
the model, and N words in the corpus. The word to topic matrix assigns a word 
probability for each word in the corpus within each topic. The topic to docu-
ment matrix assigns the estimated topics to the documents. 
Figure 9 provides an example of how a topic model can be used to investigate the 
content of a document. As shown, when looking at a text, topics can overlap regarding 
their allocation to a document. Additionally, because each word is assigned to each 
topic with differing likelihood, topics can share important words. The higher the num-
ber of topics estimated by a topic model becomes, the more overlap between topics 
arises, while also increasing the model fit to the training data. Thus, the number of 
estimated topics is a trade-off between model fit and the interpretability of the esti-
mated topics. Another way to use topic models is given by the possibility of using the 
resulting topics as explanatory variables in regression models. Topic to document as-
signments are a numerical representation of the information contained in a document. 
The advantage of topic models when compared to other ways to generate such numer-
ical representations of documents, such as 
Doc2Vec
(Le and Mikolov, 2014), is given 
by the interpretability of this model type.

Recently, topic models have become an increasingly popular tool in information sys-
tems research (Müller et al., 2016). Methodological recommendations regarding this 
technique have begun to appear in methodological IS research (Debortoli et al., 2016), 
and outlets have begun to encourage the submission of research using this methodol-
ogy (Rai, 2016). In this thesis, Eickhoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.2
) expands on the 
use of this method in the managerial sciences and information systems research in 
particular, and topic modeling is used extensively in the studies presented in research

Event Study Analysis 
Event studies are a common method in financial research aimed at investigating the 
effect of events on the future development of stock prices and implicitly on the value 
of the issuing firm. Unsurprisingly, this type of question was posed early on. Dolley 
(1933) investigated the effect of stock splits on firm value. This method continues to 
be a common tool for empirical research in accounting and finance (Corrado, 2011). 
Event studies are typically conducted by examining a larger sample of similar events 
and averaging the effect observed after the event. Events are often grouped into several 
event categories to highlight the differences among these types. The main methodo-
logical problem is given by the estimation of how the stock price would have behaved 
if no event had taken place at a given event date to determine the difference between 
this counterfactual estimate and the observed development of the stock price. Figure 
10 provides an overview of this concept. While there are several types of event studies 
regarding the underlying market conditions and how the effect of an event is estimated, 
this thesis utilizes the market model approach (MacKinlay, 1997).

shown with a dotted line. At 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 70, an event occurs and has a lasting 
effect on the future development of the series. The dotted estimate is based on 
the pre-event period. The purpose of the event study methodology is to quan-
tify this change in the process generating the series by estimating the differ-
ence between the two lines following the event. 
Foundations 
22 
As noted by Corrado (2011), this type of event study was popularized in accounting 
and finance research by Ball and Brown (1968) and Fama et al. (1969) due to the recent 
introduction of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) by Sharpe (1964). 
Another reason is given by increases in data availability to researchers after the intro-
duction of early financial information systems. Event studies have been a common 
sight in financial research and have been adopted by other domains to explain phe-
nomena other than stock prices (Skiera et al., 2017). In contrast to constant mean return 
models, market models include a reference index to relate the movement of the stock 
in the event of the general movement of the stock market, thus reducing the bias of the 
abnormal return estimate. 
In this thesis, event studies are used to relate the content of analyst opinion in the form 
of analyst reports or analyst conference calls to the abnormal returns following earn-
ings announcements. 
4.3.5
Literature Review 
As noted by Webster and Watson (2002), literature reviews are an essential basis for 
any research project because they enable authors to base a contribution on prior 
knowledge and help to identify gaps in the prior research. Additionally, literature re-
views are of special importance to junior researchers attempting to understand the sta-
tus quo within a research domain, as well as senior researchers attempting to remain 
current with an ever growing body of knowledge (Templier and Paré, 2015). 
Consequently, an ongoing methodological discussion regarding the manner in which 
such reviews are conducted has developed in information systems research (e.g., 
Greenhalgh et al., 2005; Rowe, 2014; Sylvester et al., 2013). Templier and Paré (2015) 
differentiate between the nine types of literature reviews shown in Table 2.

exist according to Paré et al. (2015). 
Foundations 
23 
These types can help to clarify the structure and intent of specific reviews, and mixed 
approaches are to be understood as archetypes because they are not mutually exclusive. 
In the context of this thesis, Eickhoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.1
) explicitly use this 
structured approach to literature analysis. The methodological section of this paper 
details the review type and the motivation for choosing it over the other types. Of 
course, the other presented contributions also base their results on the context of prior 
research and consequently use literature review methodology implicitly. 
4.3.6
Taxonomy Development 
A taxonomy is a system of classification for objects or concepts. For example, a tax-
onomy of business models can be used to determine which archetype of business 
model a particular firm follows (Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010; Porac and Thomas, 
1990) or developing a classification for different types of management information 
systems (Earl, 2001). Taxonomies may also be referred to as typologies or frameworks 
for classification (Nickerson et al., 2013, p. 337). By developing taxonomies, research-
ers organize knowledge in a formalized manner (Wand et al., 1995, p. 291). This sys-
temization of knowledge is a long-running theme in information systems research 
(Hirschheim et al., 1995). In a larger context, taxonomies relate to ontological classi-
fications, which have also attracted increasing attention in computer science and in-
formation systems research (Guarino, 1998). Taxonomies can be viewed as one artifact 
type that is relevant in the development of ontologies, among other artifact types such 
as thesauri or controlled vocabularies (Gruninger et al., 2008), but taxonomies are con-
sidered a separate research approach (Dogac et al., 2002). 
Fiedler et al. (1996, pp. 11-12) note that systems of classification were relevant to 
research 
“since Aristotelian applications”
. Regarding the use of taxonomies in infor-
mation systems research, Glass and Vessey (1995) highlight the role of taxonomies in 
structuring fields of knowledge, thereby allowing researchers to hypothesize about re-
lationships. Likewise, according to McKnight and Chervany (2001), taxonomies bring 
order to concepts and make it easier for researchers to highlight relationships between 
them. Thus, taxonomies enable theory building (Doty and Glick, 1994) if the devel-
oped taxonomy is robust (Bapna et al., 2004). Additionally, taxonomies can make di-
vergence in prior research visible (Sabherwal and King, 1995). Regarding the philo-
sophical foundations of taxonomy development, Iivari (2007) notes that taxonomies 
are descriptive or prescriptive forms of conceptual knowledge in the epistemology of 
design science. 
The taxonomy developed in Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
) is based on the method-
ology proposed in Nickerson et al. (2013). The taxonomy development process as de-
scribed by Nickerson et al. (2013) begins by determining a meta characteristic, which 
determines the focus of the further development process. In the case of the presented 
Foundations 
24 
contribution, this focus is given by searching for the determinants of FinTech business 
models. Consequently, the satisfaction of several ending conditions, such the ability 
of the developed taxonomy to classify all observations, is determined. An iterative 
development process then occurs, which alternates between empirical-to-conceptual 
and conceptual-to-empirical development cycles until the ending conditions are satis-
fied. This process is described in more detail in the methodology section of Eickhoff 
et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
) and results in a taxonomy developed using a transparent de-
velopment process, which enables other researchers to verify the results or extend the 
presented taxonomy.

Datasets 
This section introduces the datasets used throughout the thesis and has two objectives. 
First, it introduces the reader to the used data and explains the pertinent terminology 
and expands on the information about the data sources available in each presented 
contribution. Second, it discusses the properties of the different datasets, which have 
an impact on research or the conclusions that can be drawn from the presented re-
search. 
4.4.1
Social Media 
The social media data used in Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b, 
paper III.1
) was 
obtained from the SDLs SM2 database (SDL, 2017). Primarily, SM2 is a social media 
monitoring tool. However, it can also be used to perform searches on historical data 
and allows data exports using a semi-structured format based on the extensible markup 
language (XML). The database contains information from many social media plat-
forms as well as other related content platforms, such as blogs, microblogs, and social 
news sites. In addition to the full content of each post, data exports also contain several 
metadata fields, including information about authors, such as gender or age, if this 
information was made available by the platform on which the content was hosted. Ta-
ble 3 provides an overview of this metadata and elaborates on its availability. 
As shown, some fields such as author age are only available if the platform of a posting 
provides this information readily and the author of the post has opted to provide it. The 
papers using this information as a basis for analysis are therefore limited to examining 
aggregate information about these fields for specific time periods instead of operating 
at the level of individual social media posts.

News Media 
The news media data used in Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b, 
paper III.1
) were 
accessed using The Guardian’s open data platform, from which all textual content pub-
lished in The Guardian’s online or print version is available, including rich metadata 
for each content item (The Guardian, 2017). This data source is used to identify the 
type of events that occurred within a given period using the categories of news pub-
lished regarding a company. 
4.4.3
Analyst Opinion 
The analysis of analyst opinion is the foundation of research area III and its research 
questions. Thus, the sources of analyst opinion used for this purpose are of special 
importance when interpreting the presented results. This section introduces the three 
types of analyst opinion data used in this thesis, which are given by analyst reports, 
earnings call transcripts, and analyst estimate data obtained from the 
I/B/E/S 
system. 
4.4.3.1
Earnings Calls 
Earnings calls are telephone conferences that are typically held on the day of a firm’s 
earnings announcement. These calls normally consist of two sections. First, the com-
pany presents their results in a monologue. Afterwards, a question and answer section 
follows in which participating analysts can ask questions about the firm’s business. 
The information value of such calls has been studied extensively. 
Early work on this subject focused on the question of what facts a call conducted vol-
untarily by a firm can tell investors about the quality of financial reporting and why 
managers opt to hold calls (Frankel et al., 1999; Tasker, 1997; Tasker, 1998). Another 
important aspect is the question of what role these calls play in the dissemination of 
information on capital markets, and call participants may be privileged in this respect 
(Sunder, 2002). 
Since these beginnings, the analysis of tone measures such as dictionary-based senti-
ment measures has become a focus of this stream of literature in analyzing its incre-
mental value (Price et al., 2012), the differences in investors’ ability to interpret this 
tone (Blau et al., 2015), the differences in the tone of analysts and managers (Brock-
man et al., 2015), as well as what portion of this tonal measure is specific to individual 
managers (Davis et al., 2015). In this thesis, this research stream is contributed to by 
using topic modeling as an alternative to and a combination of the same with tonal 
measures. 
4.4.3.2
Analyst Reports 
The analyst reports used throughout this thesis refer to sell-side financial analyst re-
ports, which are written for a broad audience and are typically either written by ana-
lysts employed by large banks intending to inform clients or are written directly for 
Foundations 
27 
sales. In contrast, buy-side analysts conduct their research for use by their employer. 
Such reports have been subject to continuous research efforts investigating their infor-
mation value. Kloptchenko et al. (2004) use self-organizing maps to analyze the con-
tent of analyst reports. Asquith et al. (2005) study the market reaction to analyst reports 
to assess their information value. In contrast to the studies presented here, this analysis 
is based on extensive meta-data for each report while also incorporating some metrics 
for the textual portion of the reports. Similarly, Twedt and Rees (2012) study the rela-
tionship between analyst tone and market reaction. Huang et al. (2014) also study this 
reaction to analyst tone. Franco et al. (2015) focus on the effects of report readability. 
These studies are only a small sample of the active research stream surrounding analyst 
reports, which is mainly published in outlets focused on accounting and finance re-
search. In this thesis, this prior research is extended by using new methods for the 
analysis of their unstructured content. This is done using media richness and crowd 
wisdom theory to explain their information value and to relate it to other content 
sources. 
4.4.3.3
Broker Estimates 
The Institutional Broker Estimate System (
I/B/E/S
) was developed by the brokerage 
firm Lynch, Jones and Rian Inc. in the early 1970s to systemically aggregate analysts’ 
forecasts. Here, this estimate data are used as an augmentation to the data extracted 
from unstructured sources of analyst opinion and as a benchmark thereof. Initially, the 
primary focus of this database was to provide aggregate earnings forecasts, but the 
scope of the database has expanded since then. The current version of the database, 
accessed via Thomson Reuters for the purposes of this thesis, contains a 20-year his-
tory of analyst estimates (Reuters, 2015). This modern version of 
I/B/E/S
contains both 
summary estimates, i.e., the average of all analyst estimates submitted to the system, 
as well as statistical properties of these averages, such as the standard deviation of the 
average. Additionally, the underlying individual estimates are available to some ex-
tent, although these are often anonymized. The main strengths of the database relevant 
to this thesis are the extensive historical data available in the system today, as well as 
the considerable number of covered firms. The most important limitation of the data-
base relevant here is the possibility of reporting lags, for which Brown et al. (1985, p. 
25) identify three different sources: 
1.
Lags can occur when analysts revise their forecasts and inform their clients 
but do not immediately submit this revision to 
I/B/E/S
2.
There can be a mismatch between the reporting period of 
I/B/E/S
(initially 
end of month) and the reporting period of analysts 
3.
Lags between submission to the system and availability to its users 
For this thesis, only the first two lag types are relevant because historical data are an-
alyzed, which negates the problem of lags due to data processing within the system. 
Foundations 
28 
However, the first two lag types permanently change the date of a forecast revision if 
the problem arose anywhere in the historical data. However, the bias introduced by 
this is presumably small when looking at data for recent years, which constitute the 
observation periods of the different papers of this thesis (all papers are based on post 
year 2000 data). 
4.4.4
Startup Profiles 
Crunchbase (2016) is a database containing information about a wide range of compa-
nies with a focus on startups. In contrast to “traditional” financial information systems, 
the database is focused on providing information about the funding structure of 
startups and the individuals and companies providing this funding, as well as the fun-
ders of the startups themselves. This focus on non-listed startup companies means that 
for a typical company listed on Crunchbase, much less information is publicly availa-
ble about a firm than is typically available for the larger listed companies, about which 
information is gathered from other data sources in the presented contributions. How-
ever, the information provided by Crunchbase is unique regarding the considerable 
number of startups covered in the database. 
This focus on unlisted startup companies enables researchers to use the database to 
investigate changes in business models due to changes in the socio-technological land-
scape of this rapidly evolving type of company instead of limiting the analysis on listed 
companies, which are inherently more inert due to their size and corporate structure. 
Thus, these data can be used to look for patterns in startup companies’ business mod-
els, which may later be adopted by industries at large. In this thesis, this is done for 
the case of FinTech companies in Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
), which uses the 
company category tags provided by the database to identify FinTechs contained in the 
database and continues to develop a taxonomy of their business models based on this 
subset of the database.

Research Paradigms 
In this section, the different research paradigms and designs used throughout this thesis 
are introduced, and their different assumptions regarding the goals and means of re-
search are discussed. 
5.1
Behavioral Science 
What constitutes scientific research and what does not is perhaps an unanswerable 
question. However, for the purposes of this thesis, a definition is both necessary to be 
able to develop the presented research project and is useful in the interpretation of the 
presented results. Thus, the following definition is followed because it summarizes 
many important principles and is in line with the type of research conducted here: 
Scientific research is [a] systematic, controlled, empirical, amoral, public, and criti-
cal investigation of natural phenomena. It is guided by theory and hypothesis about 
the presumed relations among such phenomena (Kerlinger and Lee, 2000, p. 14). 
Kerlinger and Lee (2000) emphasize three aspects of this definition. First, research 
should be systematic and ordered, which means that it should follow clearly defined 
guiding principles or, ideally, a process. Second, research is empirical in the sense that 
scientists should not report their beliefs as a result but instead subject this belief to a 
test using a defined method, which may invalidate it. Third, the results of research are 
not filtered by the moral conceptions of the researcher.

Figure 11: 
Epistemological foundation of the presented thesis. Hierarchy of behavioral 
research paradigm, quantitative methods used to investigate the phenomena 
of interest, and epistemological justification of the interpretation of the pre-
sented results. This follows the terminology discussed by Teddlie and Tashak-
kori (2009, p. 57). While the logic of discovery focuses on the formulation of 
theories, the logic of justification refers to the justification of why a certain 
approach generates trustworthy results (Johnson and Onwuegbuzie, 2004). 
Foundations 
30 
However, because this thesis addresses the study of human behavior and the behavior 
of groups such as social media users or market participants, this definition appears too 
focused on natural phenomena. Therefore, a behavioral research paradigm is followed 
that focuses on the interpretation and explanation of human behavior. 
As noted by Devereux (1967, p. 10), 
“it is customary but unsatisfactory to differentiate 
between the life sciences and the physical sciences primarily in terms of whether the 
object studied is an organism or inanimate matter.”
Instead, Devereux (1967, p. 10) 
notes that a more prudent distinction between the behavioral and physical sciences can 
be based upon “intervening variables,” which act as a filter between what is considered 
the “cause” and “effect” within the scope of a given analysis. 
This thesis follows this idea of behavior as a mediator between causal relationships, 
and, in the strictest sense, all data used in the presented studies are a result of human 
behavior. It is therefore behavioral in nature as opposed to strictly naturalistic data, 
such as the weight of a carbon atom. 
Within information systems research, in the context of systems design, this positivist 
framework is sometimes referred to as functionalist. According to Hirschheim et al. 
(1995, p. 69), within a functionalist mindset, 
"the role of information systems
is to 
provide timely information, which is relevant to decision makers for organizational 
problem solving and control.” 
As this definition suggests, this approach to information 
systems design considers a data model to be a representation of an observable reality, 
which in turn can be used to inform decision makers about this reality to enable them 
to act based on this information. 
Thus, the contributions of this thesis are generated using a behaviorist research ap-
proach and quantitative methods and are based upon a positivist epistemological mind-
set. Figure 11 shows this hierarchy of research paradigm, method, and epistemological 
foundation of the conducted research.

Figure 12: 
An idealized Design Science Research Process. The process highlights the se-
quential creation of an artifact design and the artifact itself, and the iteration 
between the finished artifact and the search for a problem. This process 
closely follows Baskerville et al. (2009). 
Outside of information systems research, Design Science originated as a method in 
architectural design that intended to provide a structured design process template, 
which aims at anticipating the needs of structures’ future inhabitants (Fuller, 1957). 
Design Science Research, as a formalized research method in information systems re-
search (Hevner et al., 2004; March and Smith, 1995), is a problem-solving paradigm 
for artifact design. It is often focused on providing useful results and is less focused 
on discovering underlying patterns of 
truth
(Winter, 2008). Of course, this distinction 
is by no means mutually exclusive. This formalization within the IS domain goes back 
to Simon (1996). Baskerville et al. (2009) differ from prior sequential definitions of 
artifact design by highlighting the iterative nature of the design process. An overview 
of their version of the design science process is provided in Figure 12. 
As shown, the process begins with the formalization of the task at hand, resulting in 
an artifact design that is evaluated before its implementation. In the case of empirical 
model development, this ex-ante evaluation can be presented by pre-testing a design 
on a smaller sample. Finally, the completed artifact is also submitted to an evaluation. 
Again, in the case of empirical models, this can be done by comparing the performance 
of multiple designs or an evaluation of the out-of-training sample performance of a 
given model. This also relates to the iterative nature of this process; any finalized arti-
fact, e.g., the implementation of an empirical model, may point to the need for changes 
in artifact design, such as choosing another algorithm for model estimation or a differ-
ent set of model-hyperparameters. 
The relationship between Design Science Research (DSR) and this thesis is given by 
its use in Eickhoff (2015, 
paper II.2
), where the approach is used to create a frame-
work for sentiment analysis using a combination of dictionary and machine learning-
based methods. Additionally, the taxonomy development process of 
paper I.1
, con-
ducting the literature review for 
paper II.1
, and the development of the empirical 
models of the papers in research area II can be regarded as design science problems, 
although, in those cases, this is not made explicit in their research designs.

II. Research Area: Methodological 
This research area provides a closer look at the text mining methodology used in the 
third research area. Two approaches are discussed in this area. First, a literature review 
of the available topic modelling methodology and its use in information systems re-
search and other entrepreneurial disciplines is conducted. This highlights how this 
methodology is applied in these domains and what best practices and pitfalls can be 
learned from these examples. Second, a hybrid framework for sentiment analysis, us-
ing dictionary and machine learning based methods is presented. The discussion of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the individual approaches are an important basis for the 
selection of the approaches taken in research area III. This area addresses the following 
research questions: 
Research Question II.1:
What is the state of the art of topic mining method-
ology used to process unstructured content in the methodological literature, 
and how are these methods being applied in the managerial sciences to pro-
vide meaningful information relevant to researchers and decision makers? 
Research Question II.2:
How can dictionary-based and machine learning-
based sentiment analysis be combined to mitigate some of their individual 
shortcomings, such as the need for labeled training data?

Topic Modelling Methodology Review 
Topic Modelling Methodology: 
Its Use in Information Systems and 
other Managerial Disciplines 
Abstract: 
Over the last decade, quantitative text mining approaches to content 
analysis have gained increasing traction within information systems re-
search, and related fields, such as business administration. Recently, 
topic models, which are supposed to provide their user with an overview 
of themes being discussed in documents, have gained popularity. How-
ever, while convenient tools for the creation of this model class exist, 
the evaluation of topic models poses significant challenges to their us-
ers. In this research, we investigate how questions of model validity and 
trustworthiness of presented analyses are addressed across disciplines. 
We accomplish this by providing a structured review of methodological 
approaches across the Financial Times 50 journal ranking. We identify 
59 methodological research papers, 24 implementations of topic mod-
els, as well as 33 research papers using topic models in Information

Introduction 
The rise of social media platforms and the availability of news online have created 
textual “big data”, which has outgrown the feasibility of in-depth qualitative analysis. 
Quantitative methods to the analysis of textual data, such as sentiment analysis (Liu, 
2012), have consequently become an established tool in the methodological spectrum 
of information systems research. Recent developments, such as efforts towards a “web 
of data”, will only increase the need for an automated analysis of textual content (W3C, 
2013). Among the approaches to analyzing large document collections, topic models, 
such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003), have recently gained traction in 
applied (non-methodological) research. Debortoli et al. (2016) provide a tutorial for 
using topic modelling as a tool in information systems research and provide readers 
with an example analysis showcasing the use of this model class. The recent focus on 
topic modelling as a quantitative research method has enabled researchers to address 
questions that previously would have been considered out of reach. As noted by Rai 
(2016), evaluation strategies for topic modelling include the reference to expert opin-
ion, as well as quantitative approaches, such as the comparison of models estimated 
using varied parameters. However, modelling the contents of document collections is 
a challenging task and remains an area of active research in natural language pro-
cessing and computer science literature. The “unreasonable effectiveness” (Halevy et 
al., 2009) of current models representing large document collections continues to be a 
challenge regarding the question on how to use these models in social-sciences and 
information systems research. In research concerned with testing hypothesis on the 
basis of theory, it is of critical importance to be able to convince readers that the mod-
els actually represent large document collections accurately, in order to establish the 
trustworthiness of conclusions based upon the models (Lincoln and Guba, 1985). In 
this paper, we investigate how researchers across different disciplines deal with this 
problem by conducting a structured review of literature in the top outlets of business 
related literature, on the basis of which we categorize different strategies to address 
this challenge. The paper is structured as follows: In section 2, the concept of topic 
modelling is introduced before a brief introduction to the relation between topic mod-
elling methodology and (meta) theoretical considerations is given, based on which we 
discuss some of the results of the review. In section 3, the research design of this study 
is developed and presented. Section 4 presents and discusses the results of the review, 
while section 5 summarized this research.

Topic Models 
The aim of topic modelling is to determine structures in underlying document collec-
tions. Initially, topic models were developed as an information retrieval tool, intended 
to make browsing large document collections easier (Salton et al., 1975). For example, 
topic models can be used to browse collections of scientific journals according to the 
subject of articles, without relying on metadata (Blei and Lafferty, 2009a). The first 
widely used model in this class was Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA), which as this 
review shows is still a popular option (Croft and Harper, 1979; Dumais et al., 1988). 
LSA extracts the underlying topics from a term-document matrix by applying singular 
value decomposition (SVD), which results in mathematically orthogonal topics. While 
this assumption of orthogonality contradicts human intuition about topics, topic mod-
els are essentially a data compression technique and this approach leads to the maxi-
mization of topic variance on a compressed representation of the document collection 
like how principal component analysis (PCA) does when used to reduce the number 
of features in a regression problem, which many researchers may be more familiar 
with. This assumption of topics’ mutual exclusiveness is softened by probabilistic LSA 
(pLSA), which models topics as word distributions (Hofmann, 1999), leading to a no-
tion of topics more in line with human intuition. After all, we would not assume most 
topics to be completely distinct from one another. This model type is extended upon 
by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which differs from pLSA by imposing Dirichlet 
distributed priors to its word to topic and topic to document distributions (Blei et al., 
2003). 
Again, this is more in line with the human notion of topics, as it leads to sparse topic 
assignments to documents due to the sparse nature of the Dirichlet distribution. What 
this means is that not each document is a mixture of all topics in a model, but few

topics are disproportionally more important for a document than others. A more de-
tailed description of the intuition underlying this model type can be found in Blei 
(2012). This increased resemblance of human intuition does not necessarily mean that 
the more modern approaches outperform their precursors. For example, Bergamaschi 
and Po (2014) implement a plot-based movie recommender system and find that LSA 
outperforms LDA in their example. Since these methods became available, they have 
also been applied in (M)IS research. In recent years, this use has also arrived in top-
tier outlets within the discipline (Kulkarni et al., 2014; Larsen and Bing, 2016; 
Sidorova et al., 2008). Superficially, it seems that M(IS) is not making use of the newer 
model types and their advantages regarding their closeness to human intuition, but 
determining whether this is the case requires a closer look and is one of the objectives 
of the following review. 
2.1
Meta theoretical Foundations of Topic Modelling 
Research 
When analyzing approaches to automated text analysis, such as topic mining, taking a 
step back to look at the (meta) theoretical foundation of such approaches can help in 
the analysis of their use. Ignatow (2015) provides an overview of the theoretical foun-
dations of digital text analysis and argues that the meta theoretical foundations of such 
methods have not been sufficiently established and that applied social research using 
them often lacks adequate theories of language supporting the use of the method. Ac-
cording to Ignatow (2015), this lack of theoretical foundation stems from the unique 
positioning of automated text analysis between the natural and social sciences and 
weakens its relative positioning in comparison to exegetical methods and other induc-
tive qualitative approaches. In principle, there are three possible meta theoretical foun-
dations of text mining research resulting in three types of research designs. First, realist 
designs use models of text in a positivist framework to develop testable theories. See 
Elder-Vass (2014) for an extensive discussion of different variants of this approach. 
Second, constructivist designs use models of text to augment exegetical methods for 
qualitative text analysis, such as Grounded Theory (Lai and To, 2015). Third, mixed 
methods research designs (Venkatesh et al., 2016). Such studies often have compara-
bly rigorous meta theoretical underpinnings because they are not conducted within the 
“safety” of either positivist or constructivist reference frames. While the IS, like many 
disciplines, traditionally focused on research designs build upon positivist mindsets, 
recently both qualitative (Bagozzi, 2011; Gregory, 1993; Mingers, 1995) and mixed 
methods research designs have become a common sight in the discipline (Ågerfalk, 
2013; Venkatesh et al., 2013).

Research Design 
As described, the goal of this analysis is to provide insight into the available methods 
for topic mining, and how these methods are applied both in (M)IS and other manage-
rial disciplines. Ngai et al. (2011) present a similar analysis for the applications of data 
mining techniques within the domain of financial fraud detection and structure their 
review into three distinct research design phases, which represent a suitable research 
design for the case at hand. Thus, a comparable three-stage design is chosen for this 
study. In the first stage, the research goal is defined and the analysis is scoped. In the 
second phase, the research-methodology is outlined. In the third phase, we describe 
how the study is conducted on this basis. Figure 14 shows this process. 
1.1
Phase 1: Identify a Research Goal 
By determining the area of research, formulating the goal of the study, and defining 
the scope of the research, the studies relation to the wider research landscape is deter-
mined. In this research, the area of research is given by the search for available meth-
odology for the training and evaluation of topic models, as well as their application in 
(M)IS and other managerial sciences. The goal of this study is to identify methodolog-
ical opportunities for future studies and to examine how prior research has used the 
available methodology. To strengthen the focus of the analysis, this goal is formalized 
to the following three research questions: 
RQ1 (Methodological pervasiveness): 
How widespread is the usage of topic models 
in the management literature and for what purposes are these models used therein? 
RQ2 (Validation methodology):
How do researchers address the problem of estab-
lishing trust into the results of their analysis when using topic models to analyze large 
document collections? 
RQ3 (Interdisciplinary differences):
How does the usage of topic models differ be-
tween M(IS) and other managerial disciplines? 
The scope of the review is presented by an initial search within all journals included 
in the Financial Times 50 (FT50) ranking, which represents major outlets across nu-
merous management-related fields. Further outlets are accepted into the study if they 
are deemed relevant regarding the aims of the study and are discovered by the struc-
tured literature review described in the next section. In order to formalize this rele-
vance criterion, the following relevance definition is used throughout this research: 
Research is considered relevant for the scope of this study, if it falls into one of the 
four categories outlined in Table 4.

3.1
Phase 2: Research Methodology 
Our goal in this phase is to arrive at a formalized abstraction of the conducted research 
process. This serves two purposes. First, the resulting design helps when conducting 
the study by splitting the research process into individual work units. Second, it helps 
readers to assess the quality and rigor of a study by providing a clear indication on how 
the study was conducted. In the case at hand, the first task during this phase is given 
by the identification of a suitable approach to the identification of literature using the 
relevance criterion stated in phase 1, resulting in the question what ways of literature 
exploration have been identified by methodological literature regarding literature re-
views. Due to the continuous growth of the IS discipline, and the need for junior re-
searchers to gain an overview of extant research, as well as the increasing difficulty to 
remain knowledgeable for senior researchers (Templier and Paré, 2015), a growing 
body of work regarding the methodology of literature reviews has evolved. Webster 
and Watson (2002) may be considered the starting point of this methodological dis-
cussion within IS. Since, Greenhalgh et al. (2005), Sylvester et al. (2013), Rowe 
(2014), and Boell and Cecez-Kecmanovic (2015) are only a small sample of this di-
verse toolset of methodological approaches towards literature based research. 
Webster and Watson (2002) are perhaps the most notable example of guidelines to 
performing a structured literature search in the IS literature. They propose to divide 
the search for literature into three steps. Figure 14 (phase 2) provides an overview of 
this approach. First, a set of outlets is identified in which to search for relevant articles. 
Second, the references of these articles are examined to identify prior work (backward 
search). Third, the results of the two prior search phases are used to perform a search 
for articles citing them (forward search). As noted above, the relevant outlets for the 
first phase have already been identified as the journals included in the FT50. To search 
for relevant articles in the online databases listing the journals, a search string needs 
Topic Modelling Methodology Review 
42 
to be determined, which covers a broad spectrum of work related to topic modelling. 
The following string is used and was determined by iterating between including more 
search terms and removing those, which produce non-relevant results: 
“Topic Mining” OR “Topic Model*” OR “Topic Distribution” OR “Hierarchical Di-
richlet Process” OR “Multinomial Asymmetric Hierarchical Analysis” OR “Latent Di-
richlet Allocation” OR “Latent Semantic Indexing” OR “Latent Semantic Analysis” OR 
Mallet OR Gensim. 
As shown, the string contains several relevant variants of “Topic*”, where the star 
denotes the appropriate 
any
search wildcard for each database. Furthermore, different 
topic modelling techniques are included, as well as MALLET (McCallum, 2002) and 
Gensim (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010), which represent two popular implementations of 
topic models. These two are included because, as opposed to most other topic model-
ling software, they do not include topic modelling in their name. As the result of the 
literature search showed, most papers can be identified using either “Topic Mining” or 
“Topic Model*”. The search string is used to search for titles, abstracts, keywords, as 
well as the full text of papers. Initially, a longer search string was used, which also 
included abbreviations where applicable, such as LDA in addition to Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation, however the results of searches including the abbreviated terms do not 
provide more relevant results and instead clutter the search results with other meanings 
for the abbreviations, which are not related to topic modelling. Regarding the reviews’ 
scope in time, no assumptions were made during the initial search, but results indicate 
that no relevant content exists before 1978. Of course, arguably, text pre-processing 
literature precedes this year but this literature is not specific to topic modelling as a 
research method. The database search using this search string resulted in 108 results 
(1
st
order document set, Figure 14 phase 2). These documents were consequently as-
sessed using the criteria outlined in Table 4, resulting in 23 2
nd
order documents. On 
this basis, the backward search resulted in 86 additional papers, increasing the 3
rd
order 
document set to 109 candidates. The forward search added another 44 papers, resulting 
in 153 documents. At this state, due to the large number of documents in the analysis, 
we conducted another relevance check and 8 documents were removed. The remaining 
145 documents were assigned to the four relevance categories outlined in Table 4, 
resulting in 33 “Applied IS” papers, 29 “Applied Non-IS” papers, along with 24 im-
plementations and 59 methodological contributions. Figure 14 (phase 3) provides an 
overview of this categorization into methodological research, implementations, and 
applied research papers stemming from M(IS) or other managerial disciplines. The 
analytic part of this research is based on this final set of documents. 
3.2
Phase 3: Analysis 
Methodological work:
First, the methodological works are reviewed, to arrive at an 
overview of the available methodology, which can be used by applied studies. To this 
Topic Modelling Methodology Review 
43 
end, the main methodological contribution of each paper is identified by examining 
each paper in the sample and summarizing its main contribution. Based on the sum of 
these contributions, the typology shown in Figure 15 is developed, which considers 
six archetypes of contribution. It should be noted that this is not a formal typology or 
taxonomy, in which the characteristics of each paper would be mutually exclusive 
from one another (Nickerson et al., 2013). Of course, a paper can contribute in more 
than one way regarding these categories. For methodological papers, a 
model type
con-
tribution is given by the introduction of a new topic model, which may be done by 
using an entirely new approach (Blei et al., 2003), augmenting existing approaches 
(Blei and Lafferty, 2006), or changing what is being modelled (Chang and Chien, 
2009). 
Computational or mathematical
works included in the sample concern algo-
rithms or data structures of special importance to topic modelling. 
Purely statistical work, such as numeric optimization techniques, are not included in 
this review because, typically, they are not inherently interesting for applied work (alt-
hough, of course, they are of prime importance to enable it). 
Introductory 
papers pro-
vide a methodological overview, or give recommendations for the use of a specific 
model type. Often, these papers are domain specific. 
Comparative 
papers assess mul-
tiple model types, to determine which model is most suitable for a specific domain or 
document type.
Utility
papers help researchers by providing guidance apart from mod-
elling itself. For example, Mei et al. (2007) develop a method for automated topic-
label generation. 
Model validation
is concerned with assessing topic model quality and 
often develops or compares metrics for this task. Finally, a research 
domain
is identi-
fied for each paper. The list of discovered methodological papers is presented in Ap-
pendix A. 
Implementations: 
If methodological papers make their method publicly available or 
applied papers mention the used implementation, this is added as a separate reference 
category. Each implementation is checked regarding its public availability. An imple-
mentation is considered public if it is usable (license not considered) and a download 
is available. Also, since many implementations are software libraries and not stand-
alone programs, the programming language used for each implementation is noted. 
The list of discovered implementations is presented in Table 5.

Literature assessment categories. For methodological and applied contribu-
tions. The set of applied categories is identical for IS and other managerial 
literature. Methodological contributions are assessed using a separate but 
partially overlapping set of categories. 
Applied work:
Likewise, applied papers identified as relevant to the review are as-
sessed. This is done by a two-pass procedure. First, like the treatment of methodolog-
ical papers, each applied paper is assessed regarding its 
main contribution 
(not in fig-
ure)
.
These main contributions are consequently divided into 
contribution types
. Sec-
ond, the papers are assessed regarding their use of topic models. Again, the 
model type
used in a paper is determined. 
Model use
describes to what end the topic model is used 
in the paper. For example, if it is used to inspect topics or if the topics are used in a 
regression model. Consequently, 
model validation
(how the model is validated) and 
model presentation
(how the model is presented to readers) are derived by examining 
each paper in more detail. Finally, a 
domain
is coded for each applied paper. As shown, 
the model type, model validation, and domain criteria are shared between the two pa-
per categories, while the other criteria are distinct for each paper type. The list of dis-
covered applied papers is presented in Appendices B and C.

Results and Discussion 
The answer to RQ1 is presented by Figure 16, which shows the annual paper counts 
across the different review categories and the distribution of all papers in appendices 
A-C over their respective disciplines. As shown, while in earlier years most discovered 
contributions are methodological, more recently this relation has inversed and topic 
models are being used in applied studies more frequently. It is important to keep in 
mind that recent methodological work is less likely to be discovered by the backward- 
and forward search mechanism applied in this review. Nonetheless, this still shows the 
growing relevance of topic modelling methodology for both (M)IS and other manage-
rial disciplines.
Methods (Appendix A):
As shown in the result tables and Figure 16, 
topic modelling methodology has become a vibrant research subject. Starting with 
LSA (Dumais et al., 1988) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003), which represent the two most

shown, in recent years applied contributions have begun to outpace method-
ological works. 
common model types used in applied papers, 25 model types are identified in this re-
view, many of which focus on extensions of the two archetypes. Notably, despite be-
ginning the literature review with the FT50 journal selection as a starting point, many 
methodological contributions stemming from the IS domain were identified. Thus, IS 
seems to have been established as a reference discipline for researchers looking for 
methodological guidance in the use of topic models. As can be expected, computer 
science (CS) and statistics present the two other most important methodological disci-
plines for topic modelling.
Implementations (Table 5): 
As noted, implementations of 
the methodological contributions included in the review are reported separately if they 
are available, to highlight methods readily available for use. Unfortunately, while most 
methodological contributions explain the statistical approach to their work, publicly 
available implementations remain the exception. BleiLab (2016) provide an example 
of enabling others to benefit from methodological work and release implementations 
and working examples when possible. 
When comparing, the citation counts of papers with released implementations to those 
without, it is obvious that this approach pays off. Accessibility remains a major prob-
lem (Ramage et al., 2009). All publicly available implementations identified in this 
review are either programming libraries or command line applications. In the interest 
of making topic models as usable as other statistical techniques, implementations with 
graphical user interfaces are needed.
Applied research papers: 
Table 6 provides a condensed overview of the results re-
garding applied research contributions, and contrasts M(IS) with other managerial dis-
ciplines. Appendices B and C report the full results for these categories in more detail, 
such as brief descriptions for each contribution. As shown, papers applying topic mod-
elling are dominated by the two ‘basic’ model types LDA and LSA. When comparing 
Topic Modelling Methodology Review 
46 
IS to other domains, LSA is favored over LDA, while this relation is reversed else-
where. 
Also, IS research included twice as many discussion and review articles when com-
pared to other managerial disciplines, with 30% of IS articles being reviews and 27% 
being discussion pieces. Also, while 69% of non-IS articles use topic models for con-
tent analysis, only 12% of IS articles do so. In IS research, 36% percent of papers 
actively validate a model, while 59% of non-IS articles do so. Thus, regarding RQ2, 
we find that while many applied research papers make use of the topic model valida-
tion techniques proposed by methodological contributions, many researchers who use 
the topic model as a part of regression models abstain from a dedicated validation of 
the topic model.

Overview of applied research contributions.Papers in information systems 
compared with other managerial domains. Note that for the purposes of this 
summary table, less granular categories are reported than in the detailed ta-
bles. 
One reason for the omission of a dedicated validation may be presented by the argu-
ment that if a topic model produces topics which are useful as variables in the context 
of statistical analysis, this itself validates the model for the purposes of these studies. 
However, the presentation of the topic model in such cases should be especially care-
ful, to establish trustworthiness of the presented analysis. However, the lack of imple-
mentations of such model types in software intended for the use by social scientists 
remains a major hurdle for such work. 53% of all applied articles stem from the IS 
domain, followed by accounting research with 10%, while general management and 
marketing are tied at 8% each. 39% of all applied papers use their topic model as a tool 
for content analysis.
Models are mostly used as a variable augmenting existing regres-
sion models, or to gain a general sense of topics included in text collections. This type 
of article is much more common in other managerial disciplines, but IS research using 
the methodology to this end still exists. The second most common applied paper type 
is presented by review articles, which review research domains (Moqri et al., 2015; 
Sidorova and Isik, 2010) or journals (Cohen Priva and Austerweil, 2015; Wang et al., 
2015). Overall, the review indicates a diverse research landscape using topic modelling 
as a content analysis tool, as well as many research papers using it to review entire 
disciplines or outlets. Regarding their use of topic models some of the discovered con-
tributions distinguish themselves and can serve as examples providing interesting 
ways to describe the usage of a model in an applied paper or integrating topic models 
in an analysis in another interesting way, which sets them apart from papers that ‘end’ 
after a topic model has been estimated. 
First, Bao and Datta (2014), who investigate risk types in corporate risk disclosures, 
highlight topic models’ capability to simultaneously discover and quantify categories 
in a document collection, coupled with an extensive model evaluation, which enables 
readers to assess the reliability of the presented approach. Their evaluation includes 
both quantitative measures for model fit, comparisons to alternative topic models, as 
Topic Modelling Methodology Review 
48 
well as presentations of the chosen approach using graphs and word-clouds. Second, 
Paul and Girju (2009), who compare research domains using topic models, show how 
topic similarity between different models can be used to compare different document 
collections, and support their arguments using a mix of reporting the words included 
in their estimated topics and graphs showing the evolution of topic similarity over time. 
As these examples show, how a model is displayed in a contribution is crucial to es-
tablishing trust in presented results. Going one step beyond the idea of presentation, 
Ramage et al. (2009) argue that readers should be able to explore models for them-
selves. Mützel (2015), a sociologist, discusses the lack of student method training in 
topic modelling, and data processing in general, as another challenge hindering the 
integration of the method in non-technical domains but notes that non-technical fields 
can draw on a vast experience regarding the study of meaning, which can support the 
automated analysis of large data sets, raising the question of the 
theoretical founda-
tions of topic modelling
:
Using topic models for the purposes of advancing theory has 
been one of the uses of this model type early on (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) but 
remains the exception when surveying the applied literature. As discussed, accessibil-
ity may present one major cause for this. Another is given by the lack of theoretical 
foundations of topic modelling, which makes it more challenging to establish trust in 
results based upon its use. While few studies explicitly state their (meta) theoretical 
foundations, for studies classified as 
content analysis
a positivist underpinning aiming 
at the empirical validation of established theory is often implicitly clear. On the other 
hand, constructivist foundations or mixed methods approaches to the analysis of topic 
models remain largely unexplored. However, similarities and differences between 
topic modelling and human coding have been discussed (Quinn et al., 2010). Also, 
many studies use topic labels coded from the top words of topics as a tool to present 
their results. Yet, this is usually done for presentation only and not using qualitative 
methodology, which may be suitable for this purpose. Since qualitative researchers 
have developed rigorous coding techniques, this methodology can support quantitative 
topic modelling creating opportunities for collaboration. Thus, the combination of 
qualitative methodology and topic modelling remains an interesting opportunity for 
future research. Evans and Aceves (2016) survey text mining methodology and pro-
vide recommendations on how it can be used as a tool for theory generation in the 
social theory. Wagner-Pacifici et al. (2015) discuss similar issues with a focus on using 
big data to access knowledge about social phenomena. Ignatow (2015) remains the 
only article discovered in the review in which the theoretical foundations of topic mod-
elling are discussed. However, these articles do not discuss topic models in particular. 
As shown, (M)IS has established itself as a reference discipline for other managerial 
fields regarding topic modelling methodology. The exploration of the theoretical foun-

dations of the use and interpretation of topic models, as well as their capabilities re-
garding the generation and testing of social-, economic- and systems theory present an 
opportunity to strengthen this referential role of IS.

Conclusion 
In this review, we surveyed the topic modelling literature regarding the methodologi-
cal possibilities and uses thereof in applied research papers. To this end, we formalize 
our research design and conduct a structured literature review, resulting in a sample of 
topic modelling methodology and applied research papers in IS and other managerial 
disciplines. Also, we provide an overview of available implementations of topic mod-
elling approaches. Our results indicate that while, in recent years, topic modelling has 
become a tool used across many disciplines and is especially prevalent in IS research, 
most researchers use “vanilla” LSA or LDA, instead of more specialized modelling 
approaches. A likely reason for this focus on two approaches is given by the lack of 
publicly available implementations for many methods. However, some researchers 
have had great success with making their implementations available (BleiLab, 2016). 
More such “open-access methodology” is needed to advance the use of topic model-
ling methodology in IS and other domains, especially regarding model validation, 
which many toolkits for topic modelling do not yet address as a priority and the result-
ing lack of methodological accessibility remains a problem (Ramage et al., 2009). 
Looking at the non-IS research landscape, there is a need for modelling tools which 
are suited to the needs of researchers who do not use command line interfaces or soft-
ware libraries, as there are no graphical user interfaces for most available implemen-
tations. A key factor in the quality of topic modelling based research is given by the 
presentation of the model in a paper. As discussed, looking beyond the boundaries of 
individual disciplines can help to identify successful solutions to this task. Also, the 
(meta) theoretical foundations of topic modelling remain to be established to make it 
easier to integrate the methodology in studies aimed at validating or expanding theory 
in the social and managerial sciences. One promising avenue for the creation of this 
theoretical foundation is presented by mixed methods, aiming at combining the ad-
vantages of modelling large document collections with qualitative approaches to con-
tent analysis. In conclusion, topic modelling has become a useful tool for many re-
searchers, but specialized models and the development of suitable implementations for 
applied researchers remain largely unsolved problems offering perspectives for future 
research.

Applied papers in other managerial disciplines (non-IS). Results indicate a strong focus on the use of topics models as a tool for content 
analysis, which often involves using the topic to document assignments as variables in regression models. The temporal distribution of 
the discovered contributions within this category indicate a rapid increase in the use of topic modelling methods. While there are several 
tutorials and methodological advice papers within these fields, there is still room for future research regarding a broader spectrum of 
model use and topic model validation. While most studies within these fields use very extensive validation techniques for other statistical 
methods, topic model validation has not yet been adopted to the same degree. Likewise, most studies either use LSA or LDA, while there 
may still be many use cases for derivatives of these methods.

son, more IS papers discuss the use of topic modelling methodology, while using the model as part of another analysis is less common. 
As was observed in other domains, the usage of topic models has recently spiked within the discipline.

Enabling reproducible Sentiment Analysis: 
A hybrid domain-portable Framework 
for Sentiment Classification 
Abstract: 
In this paper a hybrid framework for Sentiment Analysis is presented. 
In the first part, dictionary based and machine learning based Sentiment 
Classification are introduced and the two approaches are contrasted. In 
the second part of the paper, the HSentiR framework, which combines 
the two approaches, is introduced. Consequently, the framework is eval-
uated regarding scoring accuracy and practical concerns.

III. Research Area: Analyst Opinion 
In this research area the information value of analyst opinion is studied using several 
theoretical and methodological lenses. 
Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b, 
paper III.1
) looks at the relation between the in-
formation processing of stock analysts and social media users. The paper examines 
under which circumstances social media users may be able to outperform the timeli-
ness of analysts’ assessments. Eickhoff and Muntermann (2017, 
paper III.2
) is con-
cerned with the risk of information overload arising from the wealth of information to 
investors, who have to make investment decisions. It uses topic modelling and senti-
ment analysis to reduce the decision complexity in this situation. Eickhoff and 
Muntermann (2016c, 
paper III.3
) compares the content of two different sources of 
analyst opinion, analyst reports and earnings conference calls, and elaborates on the 
topic transfer between these two media types. Finally, Eickhoff (2017, 
paper III.4
) 
applies media richness theory to the investment decision situation investigated in paper 
III.2, in order to provide explanations for the usefulness of unstructured analyst opin-
ion. 
Research Question III.1:
What structure is there to the relationship be-
tween the opinions of social media users and stock analysts, and can wisdom 
of crowds theory be used to identify the situations in which the crowd or 
stock analysts are more likely to provide timely information, reflecting 
changes in a firm’s circumstance? 
Research Question III.2:
What constitutes a decision-relevant metric in the 
context of business communications regarding a firm’s earnings announce-
ment, and how can the metrics of analyst opinion determined by sentiment 
analysis and topic modeling be used to provide such decision relevant infor-
mation? 
Research Question III.3:
To what extent do the topics contained in analyst 
reports that are released prior to an earnings call influence the topics con-
tained therein, and does the call influence the content of reports released 
thereafter? 
Research Question III.4:
To what extent can the media richness of unstruc-
tured analyst opinion, as described by media richness theory, help to explain 
its effect on post earnings call firm stock returns when compared to infor-
mation sources of lower richness?

Stock Analysts vs. the Crowd: 
Mutual Prediction and the Drivers of Crowd Wisdom 
Abstract: 
We examine the drivers of crowd wisdom in the financial domain by 
relating analyst report and social media sentiment via Granger causality 
(GC) testing based on the wisdom of crowds (WoC) theory. The signif-
icance of a large number of the tested time series indicates that analyst 
reports and social media content are suitable for mutual prediction. We 
elaborate on the conditions under which crowd cognitive diversity mat-
ters, and we derive related measures. The results suggest that the WoC 
theory can partially explain the GC between the two media types and that 
both professional analysts and the crowd can outperform one another un-
der favorable circumstances.

Analyzing Financial Analysts’ Information Processing 
using Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
Abstract: 
In this study, we examine stock analyst information processing behavior 
on the example of information transfer between analyst conference calls 
and analyst reports. From a theoretical perspective, the study contributes 
to an understanding of analysts’ recommendation biases resulting from 
their information processing. It provides new insights on how infor-
mation is actually used by analysts, while practical implications for both 
sides of conference calls and other market participants are examined. Re-
sults indicate that analysts are exposed to new information during con-
ference call events, which they consequently incorporate in their report-
ing.

Introduction 
The rapid increase of available textual information has been discussed in research for 
a long time (Baker and McCallum, 1998). Financial analysts, who we define as pro-
fessional analysts being paid to provide their analysis, as a group are especially ex-
posed to this increase in amount and velocity of information, as they are, by job defi-
nition, expected to provide an analysis that encompasses the available information. 
Analysts always been facing an overwhelming amount of information as the stock 
markets have always provided amounts of information that escape an individual’s 
scrutiny. Thus, the group may have developed coping mechanisms that are also suita-
ble for adoption in other domains. However, the information processing of analysts 
has been criticized regarding a multitude of biases in the past, some of which we will 
discuss in the following section. Due to this union of capability and (at least partially) 
understood inefficiency, financial analysts provide an interesting research field regard-
ing information processing behavior. In order to make this behavior visible, we employ 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a modern topic mining algorithm, to two kinds of 
textual data produced by financial analysts and their communication with company 
representatives. Using this topic-modelling approach, we study how topics transfer 
between the two content domains by tracking the topic-similarity around conference 
call events. This research is structured as follows. In following section, we provide 
theoretical background regarding financial analysts and their known biases described 
in literature. In the third section, we describe the two types of content used in our 
analysis and how we prepare the texts for the following analysis. Following the de-
scription of our pre-processing, we provide a short introduction to the applied meth-
odology, which begins by explaining the LDA topic model and introduces cosine sim-
ilarity as a measure for topic-distance in the context of our analysis. In the fifth section 
of the paper, we provide the results of our analysis for both a single conference call 
and the entire sample for varying subsample selections. Finally, we discuss the impli-
cations of this research for future research in this domain, as well as implications for 
concerned practitioners, and the transferability of the chosen approach to other do-
mains. We conclude the paper with a discussion of limitations of the chosen approach 
and a result summary.

Theoretical Background 
Professional financial analysts are known to exhibit a number of inefficiencies regard-
ing their information processing habits. Prior research suggests that this is caused by a 
multitude of factors, such as herding behavior, i.e. the tendency to stick to the consen-
sus estimate (Twedt and Rees, 2012), due to career concerns (Clement and Tse, 2005), 
Topic Transfer between Earnings Calls and Analyst Reports 
59 
fear of being singled out in the case of wrong predictions (Hong et al., 2000) or inad-
equate incentive structures, focusing on increasing brokerage or investment banking 
revenue instead of rewarding correct predictions (Groysberg et al., 2011). While this 
prior research focuses on identifying inefficiencies in analysts’ information pro-
cessing, we analyze how analysts actually arrive at their conclusion. Specifically, we 
focus on the topics they talk about in conference calls and write about in their reports 
on the basis of which they finally justify their conclusion. Professional analysts are 
faced by a multitude of possible sources of unstructured information, such as newswire 
services, corporate disclosures or social media. Obviously, these sources of infor-
mation are available to anyone truly interested in analyzing a firm’s performance. 
However, analysts may also have access to privileged information. Since decreasing 
information asymmetry between market participants is a prerequisite for efficient cap-
ital markets, fair disclosure regulation aims at reducing the occurrence of privileged 
communication between firms and analysts. Still, the effect of such regulation may 
have unintended adverse consequences (Irani and Karamanou, 2003; Sunder, 2002). 
One possible channel for such privileged information is presented by analyst telephone 
conferences in which analysts are able to directly interact with high level, often C-
level, representatives of the concerned company. As this degree of direct interaction 
with high-level employees is unusual, analyst calls are supposed to reveal new infor-
mation about a company’s current and future prospects. Even if the content of the calls 
is disclosed to the public in a timely manner, the call itself provides analysts with the 
opportunity to ask company representatives the questions that are important for their 
specific information needs, thus providing the analyst with information that may not 
be of value to other market participants. We apply topic-mining techniques to both 
types of content and examine the topic similarity between analyst conference calls and 
reports written prior to and after these telephone conferences. This allows us to com-
pare the topic structure of the calls to reports in two directions. First, we examine how 
related reports that were released prior to the call events are to the topic structure of 
the calls. This allows us to assess if the topics discussed in the calls are ‘new’, or if 
calls mainly discuss topics already addressed in previous reports. This also relates to 
the question of analyst herding behavior. If analysts do not bring up new topics in the 
calls, this may be a sign of ‘sticking to the herd’. Based on these considerations, we 
pose the following research questions
: 
(1) To what extend do financial analysts include analyst reports released prior to 
conference calls in their topic-selection during the call? 
If conference calls are sources of valuable new information, the topics discussed 
therein should be picked up after the call, i.e. the reports following the call should 
show increased similarity to the call when compared to the ones released prior to the 
call. Thus, we pose our second research question: 
Topic Transfer between Earnings Calls and Analyst Reports 
60 
(2) To what extend do financial analysts include conference call topics when writ-
ing post-call reports? 
The answers to these questions are of both theoretical and practical importance. First, 
if analysts do not incorporate novel information revealed in analyst calls in their as-
sessments, analyst calls are of little informational value to the analyst and merely a 
media outlet for companies. Second, if analysts do make use of novel information re-
vealed in calls, it enables market participants to study their content and predict analyst 
opinions. While the topics discussed during conference calls are influenced by both 
corporate and analyst participants, the firm holding the call could try to influence the 
development of the call by adjusting their presentation, which is usually a compara-
tively long monologue at the beginning of the call. The same holds true for analysts 
themselves. By gaining insights into what topics have affected analyst behavior in the 
past, analysts may be able to recognize manipulation attempts by corporate represent-
atives or improve their own information processing. 
3
Data and Pre-Processing 
For the purposes of this study, we make use of two sources of unstructured data, which 
we subject to modern text mining methods. For both data sources, we have collected 
comprehensive data for the multinational technology and consulting corporation IBM 
between 2000 and 2015. In this period, 59 calls and 4735 reports were collected. Of 
these 59 calls 48 will be used for the analysis as some calls do not satisfy the conditions 
required for later analysis, i.e. that they are surrounded by enough analyst reports. Both 
datasets were downloaded from Thomson Reuters Advanced Analytics (TRAA). 
Analyst Earnings Call Transcripts:
These transcripts contain the communication 
between corporate representatives and selected analysts. In the case of IBM, its vice 
president for investor relations, as well as its CFO typically represent the company, 
while a small group of analysts (~10) joins them. A typical call consists of an initial 
presentation by the company, followed by a Q&A section, in which questions by the 
analysts are answered by the corporate representatives. 
Analyst Reports:
These reports are available as PDF files from which we extract the 
textual content needed for our analysis. Furthermore, we identify the date on which 
reports were added to the TRAA database and the company responsible for their re-
lease. Both types of documents are pre-processed by removing ‘stopwords’, i.e. com-
mon English words which are not expected to help us establish the differences between 
texts due to their omnipresence and non-textual content, such as tables, figures, or 
reoccurring numbering (which would otherwise become a ‘topic’), before submitting 
these documents to the topic-mining described in the next section. Also, the disclaimer 
contained in each call transcript is removed for the same reasons. Consequently, both 
Topic Transfer between Earnings Calls and Analyst Reports 
61 
types of documents are combined into a single textual corpus, stemmed, and converted 
to a bag-of-words vector space representation, i.e. a term-document-matrix (TDM). 
We filter the TDM for both sparse and very frequent terms, neither of which are ex-
pected to be helpful in establishing statistical differences between the texts, before 
dropping all documents, which contain no words satisfying these restrictions. We do 
not convert the TDM to a TF-IDF matrix because of theoretical considerations con-
cerning the chosen topic mining algorithm (Blei et al., 2003). 
4
Method 
Our analysis will be conducted in two steps: First, we address RQ1 by utilizing Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic mining algorithm, on both types of documents and 
compute similarity scores between the resulting vectors of topic to document proba-
bility. If analysts incorporate novel information released in conference calls into their 
reports, similarity scores between the two types of content should increase if a call 
took place prior to the release of a report. RQ2 is addressed by interpreting our results 
regarding their theoretical implications and possible implications for both financial 
analysts and corporate representatives in analyst calls. Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
(Blei et al., 2003) generates a statistical model representing the latent topic distribution 
of a given document collection. The model describes the documents as a mixture of 
topics (Θ), which in turn are a distribution of the words contained in the documents 
(N). For both mixtures, a vector of assignment probabilities is calculated. Each word 
receives a (conditional) per-topic assignment probability and each topic is in turn as-
signed to each document with another conditional probability. Or formally, following 
the definition of the generative process by (Blei et al., 2003): A corpus 
D
is a vector 
of documents 
w
, each of which is in turn comprised of 
N
individual words 
w
n
.
Thus, 
for each document vector 
w
in corpus 
D
the topic distribution over documents and per-
topic word distributions are computed as shown in Table 10.

Topic Transfer between Earnings Calls and Analyst Reports 
62 
This process results in two matrices. Matrix 
A
contains the word to topic probabilities, 
while matrix 
B
contains the topic to document probabilities. Matrix 
A
can be used to 
identify the overarching theme of a particular topic by ordering the matrix by descend-
ing word probabilities for each topic. Matrix 
B 
can be used to compare different doc-
uments using their (dis)similarity regarding these topics. We use the R ‘topicmodels’ 
package for our analysis (Grün and Hornik, 2011). When training the topic model, the 
main parameter that needs to be chosen is 
k
, the number of topics included in the 
model. The choice of 
k
is a trade-off between choosing a small value, which trains a 
model with very few topics that are quite distinct from one another and a large 
k
, which 
results in a model with many topics, however, these topics may be more similar to each 
other. Another factor in this choice is the number of topics that are expected to be 
naturally included in the analyzed content. As discussed, the LDA model provides a 
matrix of topic to document assignment probabilities (B). This can be used to compare 
documents in a number of ways. A common approach is the computation of similarity 
scores between the respective topic probability vectors of two documents. A higher 
similarity implies a more similar topic structure and consequently similar documents 
that are more alike. Different measures for these resemblances have been proposed and 
such similarity scores are not inherently alike human intuition about document simi-
larity (Lee et al., 2005). Here, we will stick to cosine similarity, while the evaluation 
of different measures in this context presents an opportunity for future research. Co-
sine-Similarity measures the difference between vectors by calculating the cosine of 
the angle between them (Han et al., 2011). The resulting value is bounded in [0,1] 
since probability vectors only contain elements between 0 and 1 (typically single top-
ics have small probabilities). The cosine-similarity between two vectors 
a
and 
b
is 
defined as: 
Cosine-Similarity(a,b)
= 
𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑( )
√
𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑
(
)
𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑( )
A larger cosine-similarity is related to ‘more similar’ documents and consequently 
provides a more intuitive scale for similarity, as opposed to a larger angle between the 
vectors, which is related to less similar documents. If a topic has a high (or low) prob-
ability in document A and document B, there might be a relationship between these 
assignment probabilities. However, the inverted case is unlikely to occur. When com-
paring the documents in our analysis, we utilize the topic probability vector for the 
documents, i.e. compare 
𝜶 (𝛼
1
𝛼
𝑁
) 
to 
𝜷 (𝛽

𝛽

)
using the cosine meas-
ure. However, since we are not concerned with the relationship between a single con-
ference call and a single analyst report, but rather the relation between the two content 
types in general, a second step of aggregation is necessary before the analysis can take 
place. In order to assess if there is a change in the topic structure of analyst reports 
following conference calls (C), we select a sample of reports prior to and following

each conference call. For both periods we compute the average of the samples’ respec-
tive topic to document probabilities and denote the average topic probabilities prior to 
the call as 
𝜷
, while referring to the post-call average as 
𝜷
. If the call has an impact 
on the topic structure of the reports written after it has taken place, the similarity be-
tween the calls topic structure and the reports should increase. If there is no relation 
between the two content types at all, no stable pattern should emerge. This leaves us 
with the task of determining the appropriate sizes of the pre- and post-call report sam-
ples. There are, roughly, one hundred reports written between the occurrence of two 
calls (the number varies) and consequently a pre- and post-call sample of 50 reports 
each would capture the mid-point between two calls. However, there is the concern 
that if too many reports are selected in the sample, a present relation between the con-
tent types might be missed because, for example, only the reports written in the week 
prior to and after the call may relate to the call. However, if the sample is chosen too 
small, one cannot be certain that this doesn’t miss reports of especially well-informed 
analysts (pre-call similarity, had a topic early on), or reports written very thoroughly 
after the call (simply take longer to create). Therefore, we conduct the analysis for a 
large amount of sample sizes and compare the results regarding the mean of pre- and 
post-call topic similarities to all calls on average. The results presented in the next 
section exhibit interesting patterns based on this parameter. 
5
Results 
To give a meaningful impression of the results for the averages described at the end of 
the last section, we begin the presentation of our results by reporting one example of 
the data that constitute the average results. Table 11 provides the pre-call (
𝐶𝑜𝑠(𝛼

) 
and post-call (
𝐶𝑜𝑠(𝛼
𝑐
𝛽
)) averages for a report sample size of 10 reports in each 
Topic Transfer between Earnings Calls and Analyst Reports 
64 
direction from the call. As Table 11 shows the pre-call similarity tends to be lower 
than the post-call similarity for this sample size. The mean pre-call similarity across 
calls is 7.395% and the mean post-call similarity is 16.737%. The mean-difference is 
statistically significant on a 99% confidence level. This creates the question how this 
difference depends on the size of the pre- and post-call report samples. To answer this 
question, we calculate the mean pre- and post-call similarity for sample sizes between 
2 and 300 reports before and after the call. 
As shown in Figure 18, the post-call similarity peaks immediately after the call and 
continues to be larger than the pre-call similarity throughout the chosen report sample 
sizes. The fact that the difference is significant on a 90% confidence level up until over 
100 reports after the call is interesting in itself, as a report sample of this size may very 
well include the next call. Still, there is no notable peak in similarity for either pre- or 
post-call similarity, which indicates that topics from one call will typically not be taken 
up in the next one.

More importantly, the peak in post-call similarity is in line with the assumption that 
analysts are provided with valuable new information during conference calls, which 
leads to a topic change in post-call reports.

Limitations 
There are a number of limitations, which should be kept in mind when considering the 
results of this research. First, while the sample analyzed is quite large regarding the 
number of analyst reports and of reasonable size (n=48) regarding the calls included 
in the analysis, we examine the case of a single firm in this study. While there is a 
methodological reason for this (a cross-company trained topic model would be un-
likely to work well for our analysis), validation of these results in future research using 
different samples is desirable. 
5.2
Future Research 
As topic mining is relatively unexplored in IS research compared to other text mining 
approaches, it does not surprise that more questions remain unanswered regarding the 
usability of the topics for data mining in general and the implications of topic mining 
in the domain studied in this research in particular. We identify three possible types of 
extension of the presented research. First, a similar analysis could be applied to other 
non-financial content domains. Second, single topics can be explored regarding their 
Topic Transfer between Earnings Calls and Analyst Reports 
66 
individual domain-transfer behaviors. Third, more than two content types could be 
analyzed simultaneously: 
Transfer to other content domains: 
The approach discussed in this research may be 
useful in exploring information processing in other application domains. For example, 
marketing research regarding the adoption of topics from campaigns in social media 
posts or the analysis of political debates by the examination of topic proliferation in 
different content types might benefit from a similar analysis. The main requirement 
for this type of analysis is the existence of historical data that may be used for training 
the LDA model and that is suitable to be categorized into separate categories. 
Introspection of individual topics:
Of course, the presented results pose the question 
which kinds of topics are most likely to be transferred from one content type to the 
other. LDA does provide the necessary output for this kind of analysis. For example, 
an inter-author coding of the top words (most probable) in the topics with the highest 
pre- to post-call volatility could reveal which types of topics are responsible for the 
observed effects. Both directions of possible topic-transfer are potentially interesting 
for this kind of analysis. The question which kinds of topics are more likely to be 
picked up in a call when they are contained in a pre-call report can contribute to further 
understanding of analyst herding behavior, while the question which topics are most 
likely to transfer from calls to future reports could inform analysts which call topics 
are especially valuable information. This may also help to understand in which situa-
tions analysts do not herd, i.e. are especially ‘daring’. Finally, for both types of topics 
more likely to transfer from one domain to the other, the question of ‘topic value’ may 
be explored by relating these topics to abnormal stock returns during or after the call 
events. Another interesting question regarding the behavior of individual topics is 
given by the question if topics introduced by the analysts in the Q&A part of the call, 
which were not present in the presentation part of call, are more likely to have a long 
lasting impact on the topic structure of reports or an immediate market reaction. 
Ex-
pansion of current approach to more content types: 
While the presented analysis 
reveals interesting patterns of topic-transfer between the content types, it would be 
daring to assume a causality between the two types of content in a general sense. Fi-
nancial analysts are, as their name suggests, interpreters of information and not origi-
nators of events. Thus, it would be interesting to introduce more content types to this 
analysis and investigate in which other content types new topics arise before they are 
picked up by financial analysts or the corporate representatives present during confer-
ence calls. There are a number of promising candidates for this expansion of the cur-
rent analysis, such as news media, social media, corporate filings or regulatory an-
nouncements.

Conclusion 
In this research we apply LDA, a topic mining algorithm, to analyst reports and con-
ference calls, in order to investigate financial analysts’ information processing behav-
ior. To this end, we collect a consecutive sample of reports and calls about IBM cov-
ering the period from 2000 to 2015. Keeping in mind the limitations discussed in the 
previous section, we examine the topic to document assignment probabilities resulting 
from this model and determine average topic similarities between report samples prior 
to and after each conference call in the sample, while varying the scope of the pre- and 
post-call samples. Results indicate that, although individual topics exhibit different 
behavior, on average, analyst reports written in a short period after conference call 
events show a significant topic-uptake from conference call events. This finding is in 
line with the consideration that analyst conference calls are a valuable source of new 
information for stock analysts. On the other hand, there is no similar spike in to-call 
similarity regarding analyst reports released prior to call events, which may be seen as 
support for the “herding” tendency of analyst opinion, i.e. the tendency to stick to the 
consensus estimate until new information has reduced the risk of changing ones’ opin-
ion. Future extensions of this study may include the extension of the approach to more 
companies, which may allow to examine industry differences in topic-transfer between 
analyst reports and conference calls, content domains, the introspection of the effects 
of individual call topics, as well as the integration of other measures, such as confer-
ence call sentiment and its relation to call topics.

Abstract: 
In this research the impact of media-richness on the investor reaction 
to earnings announcements is investigated. To this end, unstructured 
(high-richness) sources of analyst opinion are subjected to text-min-
ing and combined with structured (low-richness) sources of analyst 
opinion, as well as other commonly used structured data relevant to 
company performance. Results indicate that equivocality is a major 
problem faced by investors, while uncertainty as understood by me-
dia-richness theory appears to be less dominant.

Introduction 
The quarterly earnings announcements of publically traded companies pose significant 
challenges for both academia and investors alike. Research regarding this quarterly 
ritual is extensive and often concerns the impact of the newly revealed information on 
the expectations of investors. Meanwhile, investors face a more ad-hoc decision prob-
lem. They need to decide whether to buy, to hold, or to sell a share on the ground of 
so far announced information. In todays networked society, many information sources 
are available to investors. Among those, the variant opinions of stock analysts are a 
key source of analysis regarding past and future company performance. However, 
these opinions are available over a multitude of channels including both financial in-
formation systems, which provide structured recommendations, telephone earnings 
calls, which are publicly available in most jurisdictions, and analyst reports, which 
interested investors can purchase. This poses a selection problem for investors: Which 
of these sources are (is) most important regarding the investment decision? This re-
search addresses that decision problem using media richness theory as a background 
on which different media types can be evaluated regarding a number of criteria. Fur-
thermore, media richness theory provides pointers on what kind of media type (rich or 
less rich) is more efficient, given the presence of uncertainty and equivocality in any 
given decision problem. On this basis, the available media types are evaluated and 
tested regarding their explanatory power as to historical investment decisions, which 
are measured as the abnormal stock return following earnings announcements. Section 
2 provides a brief introduction to recent finance and accounting research concerning 
earnings releases and the related sources of analyst opinion Following, it discusses the 
relation of media richness theory to the investment decision problem. Section 3 intro-
duces the data used in the following analysis. Section 4 gives a methodological over-
view and shows how sentiment analysis, topic-mining and the estimation of abnormal 
returns are performed as a basis for this research. Consequently, section 5 shows how 
the analysis is performed and presents its results. Section 6 discusses the implication 
of the presented results before this research is concluded in section 7.

2.1
Analyst opinion 
Earnings releases in general and earnings call transcripts in particular have been stud-
ied regarding their information content by continuous streams of accounting and fi-
nance research. Previous work focusses on structured information regarding the earn-
ings release itself and non-textual measures regarding the earnings call.

The information content of earnings announcements have been found to be stable over 
several 
decades 
regarding 
both

volume 
and 
return 
volatility 
(Brockman et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2015; Landsman and Maydew, 2002). More re-
cently, research focusses on textual measures derived from the transcripts of earnings’ 
calls. Commonly, studies use wordlists based measures to capture call tone (Lee, 
2015). Also, a lack of spontaneity in management responses to analyst questions in 
earnings calls has been investigated (Lee, 2015). Furthermore, investment reaction to 
analyst tone is usually stronger than to management tone (Brockman et al., 2015). In 
line with these findings, positive tone increases the effect of positive earnings surprise 
(Blau et al., 2015). Moreover, earnings forecasts published by analysts who partici-
pated in earnings’ calls immediately after them are more accurate than those published 
by analysts who did not participate (Mayew et al., 2013). It has been shown that al-
lowing analysts to participate in conference calls gives them access to private infor-
mation, even though the calls are public, and management can use such measures to 
discriminate against unfavorable analysts in earnings calls (Mayew, 2008). Still, earn-
ings calls have been found to be a valuable source of information for investors. Like-
wise, the reports and non-earnings’ calls related forecasts released by stock analysts 
have been subject to continuous interest by accounting and finance researchers. As is 
the case in the area of earnings’ announcements, earlier research focused on structured 
recommendations released by analysts. One source for these structured analyst opin-
ions is given by the institutional broker estimate system (
I/B/E/S
), in which analysts 
publish and continuously update estimates on numerous financial indicators related to 
a company’s performance. On the basis of such data, research has shown that mean 
forecasts (the average opinion of all analysts submitting an estimate) overemphasizes 
the common information all analysts share over the private information that makes the 
estimates interesting in the first place (Kim et al., 2001). In addition analysts with his-
torically more accurate forecasts are more likely to make bold predictions (as opposed 
Media Richness and the Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
71 
to sticking to the consensus estimate) than those with poorer forecast accuracy in their 
past (Hope, 2003). Like the purely earnings related analyst opinion research, this re-
search stream has also begun to analyze textual analyst opinions, which are presented 
in analyst reports and examined the choice of peer companies used by sell-side equity 
analysts (De Franco et al., 2015). On the same note it’s showing that report readability 
correlates with analyst capability (Franco et al., 2015). It has also been shown that 
report tone can provide excess information beyond structured forecasts (Huang et al., 
2014). 
As this overview of research on analyst opinion shows, research regarding the textual 
sources of analyst opinion has begun, but so far has mainly focused on the augmenta-
tion of traditional models regarding the accuracy and impact of analyst opinion. As 
shown by this prior research, this textual content can improve upon the structured rec-
ommendations given by analysts through 
I/B/E/S
and similar systems. This research 
contributes towards this growing corpus of knowledge by investigating two of the rea-
sons why this is so using established IS theory. Furthermore, topic-mining is used to 
extract information about the impact of specific topics discussed in both analyst reports 
and earnings calls. In this study, the investor reaction to the release of quarterly earn-
ings will be considered in conjunction with the release of analyst reports and estimates 
for earnings surprise. Figure 19 shows this basis for investment decisions following 
earnings announcements. 
2.2
Media Richness Theory 
Media Richness Theory as proposed by Daft and Lengel (1983) analyzes the effective-
ness of different media types regarding the transportation of information between dif-
ferent individuals or organizations. It argues that in order to convey information effec-
tively the transport medium needs to match the complexity of the transmitted infor-
mation regarding four core criteria: (1) Language variety, (2) multiplicity of cues 
(channel variety), (3) personalization (source), and (4) feedback immediacy. 
Lan-
guage variety
does not necessarily refer to the use of different natural languages but 
the mediums’ capability to transmit a wide spectrum of concepts and ideas. For exam-
ple, Daft and Lengel list music and art as media with a high language variety in their 
seminal work on the subject, as opposed to mathematics as an example of a low variety 
language. 
Cue multiplicity
alludes to the variety in channels through which a medium 
transmits information. For example, face-to-face communication offers more channels 
(facial expressions, audio, visual) than a phone call (audio). 
Personalization
or the 
source of communication refers to the soft factor of being able to interact with another 
person instead of a machine or written communication. Finally, 
feedback immediacy
extends this notion by allowing to correct faulty perceptions by the recipient of trans-
mitted information. If a medium ranks high across these categories, it is considered 
Media Richness and the Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
72 
rich. Based upon this richness categorization the theory argues that rich media types 
perform superior to less rich media types in equivocal tasks, while less rich media 
types can support information transmission in the presence of uncertainty (Daft and 
Lengel, 1986). Uncertainty categorizes situations in which a decision maker has not 
been supplied with enough information to reach a well based decision. Equivocality 
describes a situation in which the decision maker is faced with numerous and possibly 
conflicting sources of information, making it difficult to reach a firm decision (Daft 
and Macintosh, 1981; Dennis and Kinney, 1998). Earnings announcements present 
both uncertain and equivocal problems to decision makers (investors). On the one 
hand, the investor wants to assess the future performance of a company based on in-
formation, which in the best case presents the current state of the company. As all 
predictions are, this assessment is highly uncertain. On the other hand, the investor is 
faced with numerous opinions pertaining to the subject at once. The management of a 
company will often interpret a given situation differently than stock analysts, media, 
or the investor. Consequently, the information presented to the investor is highly 
equivocal. Assuming both of these assumptions hold true, media richness theory sug-
gests that there is good reason to listen to both low and high richness media types 
regarding earnings announcements. Low richness media types may help to reduce un-
certainty, while high richness media types may mitigate equivocality. This leads to the 
question if the hypothesized effects are measurable in media types related to earnings 
announcements. To address this question, the following research Questions are pro-
posed: 
RQ1
: Do low richness media types transmit investment-relevant information regard-
ing earnings announcements, i.e. does low media complexity help to investors to re-
duce uncertainty after earnings announcements? 
RQ2:
Do high richness media types transmit investment-relevant information regard-
ing earnings announcements, i.e. do increased language variety, cue multiplicity, per-
sonalization and feedback immediacy in their union increase the information content 
of materials related to earnings announcement by reducing equivocality? These iso-
lated considerations naturally lead to a third question considering the combination of 
both high and low richness media types: 
RQ3:
What is the incremental value of high and low richness media types when their 
antipode is already being considered?

Structured, unstructured Data and Media 
Richness Theory 
In this section the data types used in the following analysis are presented. In the context 
of media richness theory, structured and unstructured data can be considered as ex-
treme representations of low and high richness media types. Typically, structured data 
is highly formalized and consequently scores low in the discussed categories, assessing 
media richness. In contrast, unstructured data typically consists of higher richness me-
dia types, such as earnings call transcripts and analyst reports in our case. Thus, 
sources of structured and unstructured data can serve as proxies for low and high rich-
ness media types. All data used in this study is obtained from Thompson Reuters’ 
Datastream and Advanced Analytics (TRAA) platforms. 
3.1
Low Richness (Structured Data) 
Three kinds of low richness data sources of interest to investors are investigated in this 
study. First, the stock price of companies in the sample is collected. Secondly, several 
balance sheet related variables, commonly used in relation to earnings announcements 
are added to augment the stock price. Finally, several analyst consensus estimates are 
collected from 
I/B/E/S
, which reflect the mean estimates of all analysts who had sub-
mitted their opinion about each variable on the call date. Table 12 provides a detailed 
description of each collected variable.

Prior research regarding the effects of analyst opinion on investor behavior shows that 
investors do listen to this low-richness information source. For example, trading strat-
egies based on the consensus estimate have been analyzed (Barber et al., 2001), as 
have the effects of boldness on forecast accuracy (Clement and Tse, 2005). 
3.2
High Richness (Unstructured Data) 
Two sources of unstructured analyst opinion data are used in the following analysis. 
Both were collected from Thompson Reuters Advanced Analytics (TRAA). Both an-
alyst reports and earnings conference calls have been studied regarding to their effect 
on investor behavior. Analyst reports have been studied regarding the market reaction 
to their release (Asquith et al., 2005), the effect of their readability on abnormal trading 
volumes (Franco et al., 2015), and effect of report ambiguity on investor reaction 
(Winchel, 2015). Likewise, investors’ reactions to earnings conference calls have been 
studied in regard to the link between effects of call tone and investor sophistication 
(Blau et al., 2015), as well as the effects of call tone on abnormal returns (Price et al., 
2012). As these prior studies have repeatedly shown, these sources of unstructured but 
high-richness media often lead to significant investor reactions. Thus, both low- and 
high-richness media sources have been shown to be feasible predictors for investor 
behavior. The following data are used in this analysis. At first, analyst reports about 
the companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA
30
) between 2003 
and 2016 were collected. These analyst reports typically contain a review of the current 
financial situation of the company and an estimate of its future development, in a mix-
ture between freely written text as well as tables and figures. 
This paper focuses on analyzing the freely written portion of the reports and conse-
quently extracting the textual content of each document for further analysis. Second, 
the transcripts of all earnings calls for the same period were collected. Earnings calls 
typically consist of two separate segments.

First, the management of the company holding the call presents the earnings announce-
ment in form of a monologue of the CEO or CFO. Second, analysts ask questions 
about the announcement or other topics of interest for possible future company perfor-
mance. Figure 21 gives an overview of this structure. Three types of contribution to 
the call, i.e. presentation by the corporation, questions by analysts, and answers by the 
corporation, are extracted to calculate separate measures for each. If a call does not 
exhibit all three segments it was dropped from the sample. Figure 20 shows the annual 
counts for each media type. In the case of the earnings calls 120 per year is the natural 
limit for a 30 company (DJIA
30
) sample (one call per quarterly earnings per year). As 
shown, data are available continuously for the analyzed period with a notable reduction 
in the report count during the global financial crisis (~2008).

Method 
In this section, an overview of the methodologies and tools utilized in this paper will 
be provided. First, the text mining methods used to extract variables from textual con-
tent are elaborated. Second, the abnormal return model is developed. Finally, the com-
monly used methods to analyze the resulting data are presented. 
4.1
Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment Analysis involves extracting the emotional contents of documents or docu-
ment collections with the intension of providing an overview on the opinions and feel-
ings of their authors. Both supervised and unsupervised learning has been applied to 
this field of content analysis (Liu, 2012). While both approaches have been used with 
success, clearly certain trade-offs exist using either. On the one hand, supervised learn-
ing can offer excellent accuracy but domain-portability poses a challenge (Aue and 
Gamon, 2005). On the other hand, dictionary based (unsupervised) sentiment scoring 
is inherently limited by the dictionary of sentiment laden words texts are compared to, 
resulting in the need for domain-appropriate sentiment dictionaries (Muhammad et al., 
Media Richness and the Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
76 
2013). As this analysis intends to asses both analyst reports and earnings call tran-
scripts and finance specific sentiment dictionaries are available, the dictionary based 
approach is chosen. Two dictionaries to score both types of texts were chosen, a gen-
eral purpose dictionary developed by Hu and Liu with Positive and Negative catego-
ries (Hu and Liu, 2004) and a finance specific dictionary developed by Loughran and 
McDonald (LMD) with Positive, Negative, Litigious, Modal-Weak, Modal-Strong and 
Uncertainty categories (Loughran and McDonald, 2011). In the case of analyst reports, 
a 30-day report sample prior to each earnings call event is averaged regarding these 
categories. For the calls themselves, the three discussed segments are scored individ-
ually for each call. 
4.2
Topic Mining 
In contrast to sentiment analysis, topic mining aims to extract what is being said in a 
document and not how authors feel about a specific topic. Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
(Blei et al., 2003) is a topic mining algorithm and generates a pre-determined number 
of topics in a document collection 
D
consisting of a vector of documents 
w
, each of 
which consists of 
N
individual words w
n
. A topic z
n
is represented as a mixture of the 
words contained in the document collection. In turn, each topic is assigned to each 
document with a certain probability. 
For the purpose of our analysis the topic-assignments to each earnings call in the sam-
ple and the average of the topic assignments to all analyst reports 30 days prior to the 
call date (equivalent to the sentiment measures) are computed using the MALLET 
topic mining package (McCallum, 2002). For the calls themselves, topics are com-
puted for the entire call and not for the three individual segments. The main reason 
behind this is, that the Q&A portion of the call often contains very short text parts, 
such as short questions which are asked by analysts often receive short answers and 
consequently are not as suited for being analyzed by using LDA on each individual 
text. The topic model is trained on all textual data at once, i.e. both analyst reports and 
the conference call transcripts are used as training data.

The model is set to identify 100 topics. The number of topics is the crucial model 
parameter in our case. If the parameter is chosen too low, the resulting topics lack 
granularity if it is chosen too high the resulting topics are increasingly indistinguisha-
ble for humans. As noted, a topic consists of the likelihood that each word in the corpus 
is part of the topic. Consequently, topics can be very similar in regard to their most 
likely words but very different in their overall composition, consequently making them 
hard to distinguish. The number of 100 topics is determined by experiments keeping 
this trade-off in mind and seems reasonable as this relatively high number of topics 
helps to avoid company specific topics, i.e. topics that simply classify a text regarding 
the company it belongs to. To validate the number of chosen topics, a HDP (hierar-
chical dirichlet process) model (Teh et al., 2006) was trained using Gensim (Řehůřek 
and Sojka, 2010). This model, depending on the cutoff-likelihood (relative importance 
of one topic compared to others), points to 80-95 topics as the ‘optimal’ amount. As 
the following analysis uses a variable selection approach, choosing a slightly higher 
number seems reasonable as superfluous topics will not be included in the resulting 
models. Another option is to train the topic model dependent on companies or indus-
tries with lower individual topic numbers. The main reason this was not done here is 
that it would result in topics that do not allow for inter-company or inter-industry com-
parisons of topic impacts. 
4.3
Abnormal Returns 
The analysis of the investment decisions following an earnings announcement aims to 
capture the reaction of the average investor to said announcement. It is important to 
keep in mind that only changes in opinion can be measured on the stock market. In 
general, three possible reactions to an earnings announcement are conceivable. First, 
an investor can be positively surprised by the announcement and consequently buy the 
share. Second, the opposite reaction follows a negative surprise. However, if an inves-
tor does not change her opinion and consequently does not alter her position regarding 
a stock, no trade occurs and consequently no change in price can be observed on the 
market. Nonetheless, both negative and positive changes in opinion should lead to a 
change in the investors’ position and consequently would be observable on the market. 
Thus, the measurement is strictly limited to the unexpected portion of the information 
contained in an earnings announcement. In order to monitor the aggregate change in 
investor opinions, after an earnings announcement, the abnormal return of a com-
pany’s share after the event can serve as a proxy. This approach to measuring investor 
opinion relies on the efficient market hypothesis, which stipulates that any new infor-
mation should be represented in the stock price immediately (Fama et al., 1969; 
Malkiel and Fama, 1970).

In order to monitor the abnormal component of returns following an event, an expec-
tation of the normal return for the same period in the absence of the event needs to be 
formulated and the abnormal return is defined as the difference between observed and 
expected returns following the event:

𝑅

𝐸(𝑅

𝐸(𝑅

refers to 
the expected return given

, the development of a reference group (S&P500) of shares 
during the period. The estimation of these normal returns is performed by using the 
market model approach (MacKinlay, 1997), assuming a time-constant relation be-
tween the reference group and the stock in question, using the following OLS model:

with

and 
𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝜖

using -200 days up to -
1 day prior to the earnings announcement as training data for the return model. This 
yields the abnormal return for a given day, starting with the day of the earnings an-
nouncement itself. Indeed, both AR
t0
to AR
t10
and cumulative return measures (CARs) 
were calculated for the sample. AR
0
, the abnormal returns on the day of the earnings 
call, was most suitable for the analysis and consequently is used as the independent 
variable for the resulting models. 
4.4
Topic Selection 
As noted, the topic model trained on earnings call transcripts and analyst reports is 
used to compute the topic composition for each call transcript in the sample and the 
average topic composition of all analyst reports released 30 days prior to the call. As 
each of these two topic groups consists of 100 topics, this alone results in numerous 
topic-variables per call event. As it is infeasible to use all 200 topic-variables in the 
following regression models and more importantly it is unknown which topics com-
puted by the model, are of interest to investors, a selection needs to be performed. A 
two-step approach to this selection problem is chosen. First, a topic set suitable for 
regression is identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(Lasso) (Tibshirani, 1996), which selects a subset of variables out of the pool of topics. 
Media Richness and the Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
79 
The sentiment based variables are also supplied to the Lasso. The selected sentiment 
variables are those included in the regression models in Table 15. Second, because 
automated variable selection by itself is problematic, the resulting topic set is manually 
inspected as a sanity check. The coding is performed by looking at the top 20 words 
for each topic (10 displayed for space reasons). The resulting topic set is displayed in 
Table 14. As shown, a label is assigned to each topic by coding the top words of each 
selected topic. The type column indicates whether the topic was selected to be relevant 
in calls (C), analyst reports (R), or both. This has two purposes: Firstly, only topics, 
which are interpretable, should be used for further analysis. Secondly, it helps to make 
the following regression models easier to read, by replacing the topic numbers with 
the resulting codes. As shown, a mixture of topics indicating discussions of both fi-
nancial topics and company or industry specific topics was selected. This points to the 
possibility of estimating the topic models on industry specific samples to generate 
more granularity. However, this would require a dataset covering a larger index than 
the DJIA because within this index only a couple of companies per industry are repre-
sented.

Analysis and Results 
The topics selected using the described approach are combined with the variables ob-
tained from structured data sources and for all variables z-scores are computed (
𝑧 
(𝑥 𝜇)/𝜎
) in order to normalize the scale of the variables. It is important to keep this 
step in mind when interpreting the following regression models since the coefficients 
refer to the deviation from the mean of each variable, i.e. a negative coefficient refers 
to a value smaller than the average value of the variable and vice-versa. All calls on 
which the full set of variables could not be obtained were dropped from the sample. 
This mainly concerns two types of missing variables. First, calls for which no more 
than 5 reports were available 30 days prior to the earnings release were dropped in 
order to obtain better averages. Second, the 
I/B/E/S
estimates were not available for 
earlier years. In principle, some calls could be reintegrated after variable selection is 
performed but the smaller sample size is kept as this seemed like the cleaner approach. 
In order to analyze the data with regard to the research questions three models need to 
be estimated. The first model (M1) only contains variables from the structured data 
sources and addresses RQ1 (Do low richness media types transmit investment relevant 
information?). The second model (M2) only contains variables estimated from un-
structured data and addresses RQ2 (Do high richness media types transmit investment 
relevant information?). The third model (M3) contains both types of variables ad-
dresses RQ3 (What incremental value can be gained by combining both low and high 
richness media types?). Regarding the interpretation of these models and their connec-
tion to the research questions three aspects are of particular interest. Firstly, the coef-
ficient sizes within the individual models and their stability (especially regarding their 
sign) across the models. Secondly, which coefficients are significant across the differ-
ent models? And thirdly, and most interestingly, how to the models compare to one 
another on the model level. Table 15 shows the three resulting models. 
Regarding 
M1
media richness theory predicts that low-richness media types should 
help information transmission by mitigating issues of uncertainty (
RQ1
). As M1 con-
tains such low-richness information, it should be able to explain the investment deci-
sions following earnings announcements if uncertainty is a relevant problem for this 
decision. As shown, the adjusted R
2
of this model is comparatively small, indicating 
that the variables obtained from structured data are not able to explain much of the 
variance within the abnormal returns on the call day. Keeping this in mind, both price 
to book ratio and unconsolidated market capitalization show significant positive ef-
fects, while return on equity surprise mean and consolidated market capitalization ex-
hibit negative effects. Overall, while the examined structured data offers some insight 
regarding the investment decisions following the earnings call, the comparatively 
Media Richness and the Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
81 
small adjusted R
2
(3.8%) points at a small effect of uncertainty as described by media 
richness theory for this decision type. 
Regarding 
M2 
media richness theory predicts that high-richness media types should 
help information transmission by mitigating issues of equivocality (
RQ2
). Thus, M2 
should be able to explain the investment decisions following earnings announcements 
if equivocality is a relevant problem for decision makers. As shown, the adjusted R
2
(31.8%) of this model is comparatively large, indicating that the variables extracted 
from unstructured content explain a larger portion of the variance within abnormal 
stock returns on the earnings call day. Thus, these unstructured data sources seem to 
transmit more investment relevant information when compared to the structured data 
sources contained in M1. Within the framework of media richness theory this points 
to equivocality regarding the interpretation of earnings announcements as a major 
problem investors need to mitigate using high-richness media sources. Within the top-
ics of analyst reports released in a period of 30 days before the earnings calls several 
topics are identified that allude toward a positive effect of the earnings announcement. 
In particular, the discussion of earnings, investments and sports (likely and industry 
specific topic) show positive coefficients. Likewise, the discussion of financial data 
and market activity in the call itself shows positive effects. Finally, strong modal words 
from the LMD word list used by analysts in their Q&A questions relate to positive 
post-call returns. 
On the other hand, reports containing credit cards, corporate agreements, chemical 
products, pharma research and prudence exhibit negative effects. Of these, especially 
the prudence topic is interesting because it isn’t as industry specific as the other nega-
tive topics. Finally, negative words used by analysts in their Q&A questions show a 
negative relation to returns. Overall, this model explains a much larger portion of re-
turn variance than the one incorporating traditional structured data, thus indicating that 
equivocality seems to be a bigger problem than uncertainty regarding the investment 
decisions after earnings calls. Finally,
M3
combines both low- and high-richness me-
dia types in one model and investigates the complementary value of this combination 
beyond the value of the individual models (
RQ3
). As shown, this model slightly im-
proves upon the adjusted R
2 
from 31.8% to 34.8%, which means the improvement is 
slightly smaller than the adjusted R
2
of M1. This finding is in line with the intention 
of the measure, which penalizes models including more covariates. With regard to 
RQ3, this relatively small improvement over M2 may be interpreted as a small incre-
mental value of combining low- and high-richness media types. However, keeping the 
limitations of the chosen text mining approaches in mind, which do not extract all 
information contained in the unstructured data, it is doubtful, if this incremental value 
would be present if an informed investor actually reads the analyst reports and listens 
Media Richness and the Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
82 
to the earnings call. Both of the above also may contain the relevant information con-
tained in the structured data sources. Thus, the incremental value of the combined 
model can be doubted. Still, it can serve as a stability check for M2. As shown, the 
addition of the variables contained in M1 does not alter the sign of the significant 
variables of M2. The only change in covariate significance is given by the pharma 
research topic, which is not significant in M2 but is in M3. In summary, the models 
indicate a low impact of uncertainty for post-earnings call investment decisions, while 
providing much clearer evidence for the impact of equivocality. Finally, the incremen-
tal value of the combination of low- and high-richness media types is doubtful if the 
low impact of uncertainty as understood by media richness theory and the information 
likely contained in the unstructured content but not captured by text-mining ap-
proaches are kept in mind. 
5.1
Implications and Limitations 
The implications of the presented results can be spilt up into practical, theoretical and 
policy implications. From a 
practical
perspective, investors should focus both on an-
alyst reports and earnings calls as their primary sources of information regarding the 
impact of earnings announcements, if no automation is required or text mining is fea-
sible. Still, when this is not the case the available structured data can support invest-
ment decisions. Even when these reports explained much less of the variance within 
abnormal returns in this study. Also, as also shown by other studies (Blau et al., 2015; 
Brockman et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2015; Price et al., 2012; Twedt and Rees, 2012), 
the presented analysis reinforces the crucial effect of call and report tone towards in-
vestor reaction. The 
theoretical
contribution of this study is twofold. First, its results 
contribute towards the growing body of research regarding the impact of unstructured, 
high-richness, media types in accounting and finance research by exploring the feasi-
bility of topic-mining within the problem domain of earnings announcements. Sec-
ondly, it contributes towards the discussion of media richness theory and its applica-
tions by exploring the effects of uncertainty and equivocality in regard to the same 
problem domain. On a whole results indicate that equivocality presents a major chal-
lenge to investors. Finally, results indicate that 
policy
makers should keep a watchful 
eye on the private information gained by analysts because of their privileged access to 
top level corporate representatives as the high correlation to abnormal post-earnings 
returns may point to the presence of such private information (or analysts simply to a 
good job). The presented results should be interpreted only while keeping the follow-
ing limitations in mind. As shown, some of the topics that are identified by the chosen 
approach are industry specific. Thus, an extension of the chosen approach to a larger 
sample with industry specific topics is desirable. Also, the identified topics are time-
constant and a topic model can only identify topics, which are previously contained in 
Media Richness and the Information Value of Analyst Opinion 
83 
a corpus. Thus, entirely new topics will be missed and would be interesting to add in 
the future. Furthermore, the observation count in the final regression models is limited 
by data availability regarding structured analyst consensus estimates. Like the inclu-
sion of industry specific topics, this could possibly be mitigated, by using a larger 
index as the basis of the analysis (data collection would pose a significant hurdle to 
such an extension). 
5.2
Future Research 
The discussed limitations and presented results outline several avenues for future re-
search. First, future research can examine the industry specific effects of analyst opin-
ion on investor reaction to earnings announcement and their relation to low and rich 
media types. Secondly, many other media types are of interest to investors. For exam-
ple, social media has been used to explain stock returns (Bollen et al., 2011). Also, the 
audio versions of earnings calls present an opportunity to work with higher-richness 
media than with their transcripts. Furthermore, as noted in the limitations, the pre-
sented topic model does treat all calls and report equally over time. However, of course 
the topics discussed in earnings calls and analyst reports change over time. For exam-
ple, during the global economic crisis call topics were likely much more negative than 
the model based on all data can represent and vice-versa. This point of topic sentiment 
hints at another possible extension. The per-topic sentiment of analyst opinion repre-
sents a final possible addition to the presented approach. Finally, other topic modelling 
techniques, dynamic topic models (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), exist and a comparison 
of their suitability for post earnings call return analysis provides an opportunity for 
future research.

Conclusion 
This study examined the impact of earnings-call related low- (structured) and high-
richness (unstructured) content on abnormal stock returns on the earnings-call day be-
fore the background of media richness theory. Results indicate that uncertainty poses 
a smaller challenge for investors than equivocality, i.e. that the decision problem of 
investors is dominated not by a lack of clarity or information availability but a lack of 
consensus among the available information sources. Furthermore, the complementary 
value of combining low- and high-richness media types is examined but results regard-
ing this combination are unclear. While combined models show minor improvements 
over one only including high-richness media, it is doubtful if this improvement would 
be present if investors manually examine high-richness media sources. Additionally, 
results reinforce the evidence for the relation between analyst tone and investor reac-
tion to analyst opinion and explore topic-mining as another information extraction 
technique that can aid in understanding the content of analyst communication.

Contributions 
The presented contributions aim at investigating three research areas to provide a 
multi-faceted view of the origins, means of analysis, and use cases for unstructured 
opinion data in the financial industry. 
The first research area focuses on the entrepreneurial environment of the financial in-
dustry in the context of FinTech companies and the innovative business models that 
these companies have developed. 
The second research area focuses on methodological questions and provides an over-
view of different content analysis techniques, which are needed to cope with growing 
amounts of unstructured data relevant to financial markets, as well as how researchers 
have addressed this challenge in information systems research and other managerial 
disciplines. 
The third and final research area constitutes the focus of this thesis. Here, unstructured 
content produced by stock analysts and distributed over different media types, such as 
analyst reports or analyst conference calls after earnings announcements, are analyzed 
by using the methodologies discussed in the second research area. 
In this chapter, the contributions of the individual research papers constituting this 
thesis are briefly reiterated and related to the overarching research questions of each 
research area. Consequently, the practical, theoretical, and policy implications of these 
findings are discussed. Finally, the limitations of the presented results are discussed 
before outlining future research avenues based on the presented thesis.

Summary of Results 
This section summarizes the findings regarding the research questions outlined in sec-
tion 2. This is done by restating each research question and providing a summary of 
the results. See the results and discussion sections of the individual contributions for 
more extended result discussions based on the more granular research questions of the 
individual papers. 
1.1
Research Area I: Entrepreneurial Environment 
This research area is aimed at establishing an overview of the entrepreneurial environ-
ment, in which the results of the other two research areas are to be understood. It in-
troduced the entrepreneurial environment and the changing technological landscape, 
which have made it necessary to find innovative ways to analyze data and remain com-
petitive given increasingly diverse competitors and new analytical demands. Its first 
research question was as follows: 
Research Question I.1: 
What are the dimensions and characteristics of typical 
business models of FinTech companies? 
The answer to this question is given by the FinTech business model taxonomy devel-
oped in Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
). As discussed in more detail in that contribu-
tion, a taxonomy, as defined by Nickerson et al. (2013), consists of a unique combina-
tion of dimensions, referring to the categories in which an object is considered, and 
characteristics, meaning the possible values within these dimensions. The dimensions 
identified in this iterative taxonomy development process are given by a company’s 
dominant technology component, its value proposition, the delivery channel for its 
products, its main source of revenue, and its product or service offering. In turn, for 
each of these dimensions, a set of possible characteristics were identified. For example, 
automation, collaboration, and customization constitute some of the characteristics of 
the value proposition dimension in the developed taxonomy. See the results section of 
Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
) for the full taxonomy. Definitions for each dimension 
and characteristic are also provided in the paper. 
Regarding the focus of this thesis, the developed taxonomy shows how analytical busi-
ness models making use of decision support systems or Blockchain technology gain 
increasing relevance in the financial domain. On this basis, the second research ques-
tion of this research area was as follows: 
Research Question I.2: 
How can these business models be grouped into dif-
ferent FinTech niche markets? 
Contributions 
87 
This question is addressed in the evaluation section of Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper 
I.1
), where hierarchical clustering is used to cluster FinTechs in the sample to validate 
the developed taxonomy by using this clustering to assess the comprehensiveness of 
the taxonomy within the sample. This is done to determine whether the taxonomy en-
ables us to explain each resulting company cluster, and the taxonomy satisfies this 
criterion. We consequently use the developed taxonomy to classify each company 
from each cluster regarding its business model using the developed dimensions and 
characteristics. Based on this application of the developed taxonomy, we look at the 
dominant characteristics within each company cluster and derive FinTech business 
model archetypes from the resulting distinct combinations of characteristics, such as 
payment service providers, alternative trading venues, and lending communities. 
The results show that cryptocurrency-based and machine learning- or analytics-based 
businesses are challenging incumbent market participants in the financial domain. 
1.2
Research Area II: Methodological 
This research area concerns the methodology with which the information within un-
structured content related to capital markets can be transformed to be analyzed by tra-
ditional statistical methods and how these methods are currently being used in mana-
gerial research disciplines to provide meaningful answers to research questions rele-
vant in these disciplines. 
Its first research question was given by determining the current state regarding topic 
modeling literature in information systems and other managerial research disciplines: 
Research Question II.1:
What is the state of the art of topic mining method-
ology used to process unstructured content in the methodological literature, 
and how are these methods being applied in the managerial sciences to pro-
vide meaningful information relevant to researchers and decision makers? 
The results of Eickhoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.1
) concern three different areas of 
research. First, methodological contributions regarding topic modeling are considered. 
Second, available implementations of these topic modeling approaches are discussed. 
Third, applied research papers using the methods are investigated regarding their ap-
proach towards this methodology. Finally, the theoretical foundations of research us-
ing topic modeling methodology and its use in theory testing are considered. 
First, topic modeling methodology has become a vibrant research subject. Starting 
with LSA (Dumais et al., 1988) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003), which represent the two 
most common model types used in applied papers, 25 model types are identified in the 
review, many of which focus on extensions of the two archetypes. Notably, many 
methodological contributions stemming from the IS domain are identified. Thus, IS 
Contributions 
88 
appears to have been established as a reference discipline for researchers looking for 
methodological guidance in the use of topic models. As can be expected, computer 
science and statistics present the two other most important methodological disciplines 
for topic modeling. 
Second, regarding implementations, while most methodological contributions explain 
the statistical approach to their work, publicly available implementations remain the 
exception. BleiLab (2016) provides an example of enabling others to benefit from 
methodological work and released implementations and working examples if possible. 
When comparing the citation counts of papers with released implementations to those 
without, it is obvious that this approach is useful in this metric. However, methodo-
logical accessibility remains a major problem (Ramage et al., 2009). 
Third, papers applying topic models are dominated by the two “basic” model types of 
LDA (27%) and LSA (35%), indicating many opportunities to augment the prior work 
by using more case-specific model types. Fifty-three percent of all applied articles 
stem from the IS domain, followed by accounting research at 10%, while general man-
agement and marketing are tied at 8% each. Thirty-nine percent of all applied papers 
use their topic model as a tool for content analysis. Within this category, models are 
mostly used as a variable augmenting existing regression models or to gain a general 
sense of topics included in text collections. This type of article is much more common 
in other managerial disciplines, but IS research using the methodology to this end still 
exists. The second most common applied paper type is presented by review articles, 
which review entire research domains (Moqri et al., 2015; Sidorova and Isik, 2010) or 
focus on individual journals (Cohen Priva and Austerweil, 2015; Wang et al., 2015). 
Finally, using topic models for the purposes of advancing theory has been one of the 
uses of this model type early on (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) but remains the excep-
tion when surveying the applied literature. As discussed, accessibility may present one 
major cause for this. Another is given by the lack of theoretical foundations of topic 
model usage, which makes it more challenging to establish trust in results based upon 
its use. While few studies explicitly state their (meta) theoretical foundations, for stud-
ies classified as 
content analysis,
a positivist underpinning aiming at the empirical val-
idation of established theory is often implicitly clear. On the other hand, constructivist 
foundations or mixed method approaches to the analysis of topic models remain 
largely unexplored. However, similarities and differences between topic modeling and 
human coding have been discussed (Quinn et al., 2010). Since qualitative researchers 
have developed rigorous coding techniques, this methodology can support quantitative 
topic modeling, thereby creating opportunities for collaboration (Teddlie and Tashak-
kori, 2009).

This research area’s next research question was given by investigating how different 
sentiment analysis techniques can be combined and what advantages such a combina-
tion potentially has: 
Research Question II.2:
How can dictionary-based and machine learning-
based sentiment analysis be combined to mitigate some of their individual 
shortcomings, such as the need for labeled training data? 
The answer to this question is provided by the sentiment analysis framework and soft-
ware artifact presented in Eickhoff (2015,
paper II.2
). This approach uses dictionary-
based sentiment analysis to bootstrap training data for supervised learning techniques. 
While as outlined in the contribution, this approach does work and combines some of 
the benefits of supervised learning techniques, such as being able to capture domain-
specific word valence with the domain portability of general purpose sentiment dic-
tionaries, it should be remembered that the accuracy of the resulting model is unlikely 
to exceed that of a purely dictionary-based solution by much, as is discussed in more 
detail in the paper.

Research Area III: Analyst Opinion 
This research area was concerned with both the processing of unstructured analyst 
opinion and other unstructured information sources related to capital markets and the 
impact that these different media types have on individual companies. It also examined 
how information systems and business administration theory can be applied to these 
problems and provide explanations as to why such effects exist. This research area’s 
first research question was given by the relationship of social media and analyst opin-
ion to crowd wisdom theory: 
Research Question III.1:
What structure is there to the relationship be-
tween the opinions of social media users and stock analysts, and can wisdom 
of crowds theory be used to identify the situations in which the crowd or 
stock analysts are more likely to provide timely information, reflecting 
changes in a firm’s circumstance? 
This question was investigated in Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b, 
paper III.1
). The 
results indicate that social media platform diversity, such as the number of different 
platforms used by social media users in a sample, increases the likelihood of Granger 
cause between the two types of content in either direction. However, the same could 
not be shown in this research for age diversity, and an increase in the average age of 
social media users decreases the likelihood of social media user sentiment being able 
to explain analyst opinion. While this appears counterintuitive, as one may expect 
older users to be more knowledgeable on average, this does not contradict the crowd

wisdom theory because an increase in average age does not in itself constitute an in-
crease in cognitive diversity. In line with crowd wisdom theory, we find that an in-
crease in social media user authority measures results in a decrease of explanatory 
power for social media users, the theoretical explanation being that a group more as-
sertive in its tone may result in conflicting opinions not being voiced. 
Interestingly, an increase in social media user certainty also decreases the likelihood 
of analysts predicting social media sentiment. This, however, does not relate to crowd 
wisdom theory because the authority measure only concerns social media users. In-
vestigating this for security analysts as another form of a crowd would itself be inter-
esting. Overall, our results regarding the crowd wisdom measures for the theoretical 
constructs described by Surowiecki (2005) are promising. The results indicate that 
there is indeed a measurable connection between the makeup of the crowd and its abil-
ity to explain analyst opinion. Although it is difficult to compare the results between 
different content domains, this result corresponds with previous crowd wisdom re-
search, such as the efforts to explain the content quality of Wikipedia (Arazy et al., 
2006) or its comparable quality to classic encyclopedias (Giles, 2005). 
Interestingly, this suggests that crowd wisdom can arise without a system that is spe-
cifically designed to allow the crowd to aggregate their opinion. Prior research high-
lights the importance of group coordination for content quality (Kittur and Kraut, 
2008). In our case, this aggregation only occurs after the fact using sentiment analysis. 
Examining how the support of the crowd’s coordination may improve their infor-
mation processing capabilities is an interesting question for future research. 
The second half of this research question concerns the situational component of the 
relevance of crowd wisdom. This is investigated regarding industry dummies, com-
pany characteristics, and the types of news released within a given timeframe. Overall, 
the industry dummies confirm prior research, indicating that stock analysts’ recom-
mendations do indeed carry inherent value (Womack, 1996). At the same time, no 
significant support for any industry in the sample adds explanatory power to the 
crowds’ opinion. Regarding company-specific effects, we observe a decrease in the 
capabilities of the crowd to predict the analyst sentiment for companies with a higher 
number of subsidiaries. This might be because large multinational companies are too 
complex to be summarized by a single measure of crowd opinion. The crowd may 
have a positive opinion of one division of a firm while expressing a negative opinion 
about another. Regarding the effects of the news, we find that the type of news released 
in the observation period has a significant effect on the crowds’ performance. For ex-
ample, business news decreases the likelihood of analysts’ ability to predict social me-
dia users. This supports the known tendency that analysts have to adhere to prior as-
sessments (Trueman, 1994).

91 
In summary, the results of Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b, 
paper III.1
) suggest 
that the crowd wisdom theory indeed provides useful constructs that can be operation-
alized to explain when the crowd can arrive at opinions prior to the availability of 
expert assessment. The second research question within this research area concerned 
how topic modeling can be used to support decision makers in overcoming the problem 
of information overload in the context of earnings releases: 
Research Question III.2:
What constitutes a decision-relevant metric in the 
context of business communications regarding a firm’s earnings announce-
ment, and how can metrics of analyst opinion determined by sentiment anal-
ysis and topic modeling be used to provide such decision-relevant infor-
mation? 
This research question was addressed in Eickhoff and Muntermann (2017, 
paper 
III.2
). Regarding the definition of “relevance” in the context of business communica-
tions, we presented a topic-model based analysis and optimized the topic selection 
regarding abnormal returns as an investment-relevant criterion. Of course, stock re-
turns are only one possible solution to this question. In other non-investment contexts, 
this criterion would have to be changed. For example, in a marketing context, product 
sales or ad impressions could serve as an appropriate alternative. The important char-
acteristic of the criterion regarding the chosen selection procedure is “quantifiability,” 
meaning the feasibility to use the criterion as the object of a statistical optimization 
procedure. 
To address the question of how to train topic models with the aim of filtering non-
relevant topics in business communications, our analysis has shown that there are sev-
eral considerations when training topic models to describe the topics contained in quar-
terly earnings announcements and analyst opinion related to these announcements. On 
the one hand, it appears prudent to train topic models specific to a certain industry or 
company. On the other hand, this introduces the danger of missing topics, which have 
not impacted a specific company or industry in the past. Therefore, we opted to train 
our topic model without such specificity but rather an increased number of topics to 
capture a wide range of possible subjects. Concerning the question of how to identify 
a relevant subset of topics suitable as information regarding the decision problem, we 
present an approach to reduce the number of topics to be considered by using the Lasso 
(Tibshirani, 1996) as a variable selection and parameter shrinkage approach. 
This leads to the reflection of our results in the broader context of information over-
load. Any model-based approach to complexity reduction sacrifices some information 
in the interest of simplification. Consequently, while this topic model-based approach 
can certainly help to reduce the information overload during the decision-making pro-
cess, the corresponding loss of information must be considered carefully within the 
Contributions 
92 
confines of the domain-specific decision problem. Within the financial domain, the 
operationalization of topic relevance is comparatively easy. The goal of investments 
(profit) is clearly measurable and relatively well-understood. Even slight additions to 
this goal, such as the incorporation of moral considerations into the investment deci-
sion, prohibit the chosen approach to the problem. Still, if the goal is as clear as in the 
analyzed case, the presented approach can provide an important contribution given by 
the reduction of the decision complexity that the model achieves. 
The third research question in this area concerned how topics transfer between stock 
analyst reports and earnings conference calls: 
Research Question III.3:
To what extent do the topics contained in analyst 
reports released prior to an earnings call influence the topics contained 
therein, and does the call influence the content of reports released thereafter? 
This research question was addressed in Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016c, 
paper 
III.3
). This is done by comparing the topic cosine similarity of reports released prior 
to and after an earnings conference call with this call itself. 
The results show that the mean pre-call similarity across calls in the sample is ~7.4%, 
and the mean post-call similarity is ~16.7%. This mean difference is statistically sig-
nificant at a 99% confidence level. This leads to the question of whether this difference 
depends on the size of the pre- and post-call report samples. The post-call similarity 
peaks immediately after the call and continues to be larger than the pre-call similarity 
throughout the chosen report sample sizes. 
The fact that the difference is significant at a 90% confidence level up until over 100 
reports after the call is interesting because a report sample of this size may well include 
the next call. Still, there is no notable peak in similarity for either the pre- or post-call 
similarity, which indicates that topics from one call will typically not be raised in the 
next call. More importantly, the peak in post-call similarity is in line with the assump-
tion that analysts are provided with valuable additional information during conference 
calls, which leads to a topic change in post-call reports. 
Thus, the results indicate that earnings conference calls play an important role in dis-
seminating information regarding earnings releases, and the topics contained in them 
are often discussed in the analyst reports released in the following days. 
Contributions 
93 
The fourth research question in this research area was given by the relationship of 
media richness theory and analyst opinion: 
Research Question III.4:
To what extent can the media richness of unstruc-
tured analyst opinion, as described by media richness theory, help to explain 
its effect on post earnings call firm stock returns when compared to infor-
mation sources of lower richness?
Media richness theory predicts that low-richness media types should help information 
transmission by mitigating issues of uncertainty. As shown in
Eickhoff (2017, 
paper 
III.4
), this effect appears to be comparatively small in the observed examples, pointing 
to a small effect of uncertainty about the information relevant to earnings announce-
ments. Additionally, media richness theory predicts that high-richness media types 
should help information transmission by mitigating issues of equivocality. 
Thus, high-richness media should be able to explain the investment decisions follow-
ing earnings announcements if equivocality is a relevant problem for decision makers. 
As shown in 
Eickhoff (2017, 
paper III.4
), the explanatory power of such a model is comparatively 
large, indicating that the variables extracted from unstructured content explain a larger 
portion of the variance within abnormal stock returns on the earnings call day. Thus, 
these unstructured data sources appear to transmit more investment relevant infor-
mation when compared to structured data sources within the confines of that analysis. 
Within the framework of media richness theory, this points to equivocality regarding 
the interpretation of earnings announcements as a major problem that investors need 
to mitigate using high-richness media sources. In summary, Eickhoff (2017, 
paper 
III.4
) indicates a low impact of uncertainty for post-earnings call investment decisions 
while providing much clearer evidence for the impact of equivocality. Finally, the in-
cremental value of the combination of low- and high-richness media types is doubtful 
if the comparatively low impact of uncertainty, as understood by media richness the-
ory, and the information likely contained in the unstructured content but not captured 
by text-mining approaches are borne in mind.

Implications 
2.1
Research Area I: Entrepreneurial Environment 
The implications of the results in this research area can be grouped into implications 
for research, practical implications, and policy implications. 
Implications for Research:
The first implication of this research area is its contribu-
tion toward developing a consensus on the question of what constitutes FinTech. As 
discussed, due to the rapidly changing landscape in the financial industry in general, 
FinTech companies in particular, and the relative youth of the “FinTech phenomenon”, 
the lines between incumbent firms and FinTech companies are not distinct. Further-
more, the lines are blurred between traditional tech firms selling their products to banks 
and the new phenomenon of FinTech, in which firms challenge the established finan-
cial industry by providing either what was traditionally considered a financial service 
or entirely new related services. 
To this end, the presented taxonomy of business models can be interpreted in terms of 
what it does not include. Considered in conjunction with existing definitions of 
FinTech firms, this enables researchers to focus on the new phenomenon. Addition-
ally, the presented taxonomy provides an overview of the studied phenomenon. Thus, 
the dimensions and characteristics of FinTech business models included in the taxon-
omy presented in Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
) help to identify different types of 
FinTech business models by abstraction beyond the business model of individual 
firms. In conjunction with the presented clustering of firm attributes, this allows for 
the identification of firms that are especially unlike each other, each of which repre-
sents a different facet of the FinTech landscape. Furthermore, the presented dimen-
sions and characteristics provide a basis for further theory development and theory 
testing related to the FinTech phenomenon (Varshney et al., 2015). 
Practical implications: 
Taxonomies allow for the abstraction needed to identify un-
occupied business models, as reflected by combinations of characteristics currently not 
offered by competing firms. Additionally, incumbents can use the taxonomy to gain 
an overview of which traditional business models are threatened by new competition 
and which new business models are being developed. Thus, the presented taxonomy 
allows practitioners to gain an overview of the current status quo in this rapidly chang-
ing environment. 
Policy implications: 
The financial services and banking sector is a highly regulated 
industry, in which incumbents must comply with regulations regarding problems such 
as fraud prevention, identity theft, organized crime, and sanctions against nation states. 
Regulators have established processes to address these and many other concerns with 
Contributions 
95 
incumbent firms. FinTechs have not been subject to the same level of scrutiny if they 
themselves have not been classified as banks or providers of financial services. How-
ever, the nature of FinTech business models implies that these firms face many of the 
same risks as traditional banks. For example, they handle similarly sensitive customer 
information and may be targeted by illegal activity such as fraud or process financial 
transactions across national borders, which entails the risk of the malicious use of such 
services. Thus, it is imperative for regulators to gain an overview of what business 
models are being created in this new sector of the financial industry. Parts of this new 
industry segment may create a need for new forms of regulation or an extension of the 
applicability of existing rules. 
2.2
Research Area II: Methodological 
The implications of the results presented in Eickhoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.1
) 
mainly regard the manner in which applied research using topic modeling techniques 
is conducted. As shown therein, applied studies often do not present the topic model 
in a way that makes the result appear trustworthy or accessible to the reader. Related 
to this concern, few studies use any manual model validation approach, such as coding 
topics to labels for introspection, or use model fit metrics. 
As noted, no implementation of state of the art topic models exist, which feature a 
graphical user interface, thus rendering use of the methodology difficult for research-
ers who do not have a technical background. This is obviously prohibitive for entire 
research domains. The main implication of Eickhoff (2015, 
paper II.2
) is given by 
highlighting the need for methodological transparency in content analysis-based re-
search. This transparency can be achieved by using open source implementations of 
any applied content analysis techniques, enabling other researchers to replicate prior 
studies and build upon their results. Furthermore, the presented framework provides 
guidelines for conducting applied research using such methods. 
2.3
Research Area III: Analyst Opinion 
As discussed, the results of Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b, 
paper III.1
) add to the 
growing body of work by suggesting that crowd wisdom as a phenomenon can be used 
to explain the (sometimes surprising) quality of the content created by large groups. 
Our contribution to this theoretical body of research is twofold. First, the comparison 
to stock analysts allows for the benchmarking of crowd wisdom against an expert 
group. The results of the analysis suggest that in some situations, the crowd can add 
information in a timelier manner than experts. Second, our analysis supports crowd 
wisdom theory as proposed by Surowiecki (2005). 
Contributions 
96 
We divide the 
practical implications
of this research into implications for the finan-
cial sector and those for social media users and platforms. Within the financial sector, 
our results inform the customers of analysts about the conditions under which analyst 
research is especially valuable but also when it may be wise to resort to social media 
monitoring tools to gauge the crowd’s opinion. The results also reveal how to aggre-
gate the opinions of social media users. Similarly, stock analysts are informed of the 
circumstances under which it may be wise to listen to social media users’ opinions as 
an additional source of information but also when they are unlikely to provide valuable 
information. In addition, the operationalization of crowd wisdom-related constructs 
can help companies refine their social media monitoring tools to better reflect the di-
verse opinion of the crowd. 
Aside from companies, this research should also be relevant to social media content 
aggregators who need to know the type of data on social media users that interest their 
customers. Finally, special purpose social networks such as stock recommendation 
communities or social lending communities are fundamentally based on the concept 
of crowd wisdom, and their success depends on understanding the conditions under 
which it arises. The members of such communities expect these platforms to deliver 
insights gained from this crowd wisdom. Thus, crowd wisdom theory-based results 
provide such communities with guidelines regarding the makeup of wise crowds. 
We distinguish between the theoretical and practical implications of Eickhoff and 
Muntermann (2017, 
paper III.2
). The 
practical implications
of the presented re-
search are given by the identification of decision-relevant topics and the resulting re-
duction of decision complexity, which is desirable because it reduces the risk of infor-
mation overload. Another possible application of the chosen approach is given by the 
possible (partial) automation of the decision process. Because no step of the chosen 
approach requires manual intervention, this could technically be feasible. However, it 
may not be practically desirable because of the risk of misclassification resulting from 
a fully automated solution. Additionally, such automation would require extensive 
back-testing and should incorporate other non-topic-based approaches to stock return 
estimation beyond the analysis of 
paper III.2
. 
The 
theoretical contribution
of the presented research is given by its addition to the 
growing stream of literature regarding the risk of information overload and the pre-
sented mitigation approach to such problems. We structured the decision problem re-
lated to the phenomenon of information overload according to the phases of the deci-
sion-making process, providing a theoretical foundation for determining the approach-
able steps of our analysis (Simon, 1977). As shown, topic mining and identifying the 
most relevant topics in business communications represent a suitable strategy to cope 
with information overload. However, the examined context does represent a typical 
Contributions 
97 
situation of information overload, meaning a situation in which too large volumes of 
information need to be processed by a decision maker within a constrained amount of 
time. 
The implications of Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016c, 
paper III.3
) are twofold. First, 
the implication of this study for future research is given by its method of studying the 
transfer of topics discussed in documents stemming from different media types. Stud-
ies of this nature are interesting regarding many other media types than the two sources 
of analyst opinion studied in this contribution; see section 4.3 (future research) for a 
more detailed discussion of this possibility. From a practical point of view, the impli-
cation of the presented results is given by stressing the importance of analyst confer-
ence calls as a means of information disclosure relevant to price discovery on capital 
markets. 
The implications of the results presented in Eickhoff (2017, 
paper III.4
) can be spilt 
up into practical, theoretical and policy implications. From a 
practical
perspective, 
investors should focus both on analyst reports and earnings calls as their primary 
sources of information regarding the impact of earnings announcements if no automa-
tion is required or if text mining is feasible. Keeping in mind the results of Eickhoff 
and Muntermann (2016c, 
paper III.3
), the role of conference calls regarding infor-
mation dissemination is difficult to overstate. Additionally, as also shown by other 
studies (Blau et al., 2015; Brockman et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2015; Price et al., 2012; 
Twedt and Rees, 2012), the presented analysis reinforces the crucial effect of the call 
and report tone towards investor reactions to this information. 
The 
theoretical
contribution of this study is twofold. First, its results contribute to-
wards the growing body of research regarding the impact of unstructured, high-rich-
ness media types in accounting and finance research by exploring the feasibility of the 
topic mining of earnings announcements. Second, it contributes to the discussion of 
media richness theory and its applications by exploring the effects of uncertainty and 
equivocality regarding the same problem domain. In total, the results indicate that 
equivocality presents a major challenge for investors. Finally, the results indicate that 
policy
makers should keep a watchful eye on the “
private”
information gained by an-
alysts because of their privileged access to top level corporate representatives because 
the high correlation to abnormal post-earnings returns makes the ability to contribute 
to the call content inherently valuable.

Limitations 
3.1
Research Area I: Entrepreneurial Environment 
The taxonomy presented in Eickhoff et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
) should be interpreted 
while keeping in mind several assumptions and decisions made during its develop-
ment, which influence the result of the development process. 
First
, regarding the de-
velopment of dimensions, the selection of dimensions based on the business model 
literature is inherently selective and thereby limits itself to dimensions that exist a pri-
ori in the extant literature. Due to the dynamic nature of business and the FinTech 
movement in particular, we cannot exclude the possibility that, for a given company, 
multiple possible characteristics exist that contradict the definition of Nickerson et al. 
(2013) of mutually exclusive characteristics. Additionally, the development of one tax-
onomy for all types of FinTech companies limits the granularity of our results in the 
presented research. Regarding the scope of our study, our taxonomy development was 
limited to companies contained in our sample. While this sample is quite large, not 
every company has an inherent need to be listed in such a database. This may be espe-
cially true for non-US or non-EU firms because the sample is skewed towards these 
regions. 
3.2
Research Area II: Methodological 
The literature review presented in Eickhoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.1
) is inherently 
limited by the initial focus on journals contained in the Financial Times 50 journal 
selection. While this focus is in line with the goals of the analysis, especially regarding 
applied contributions, there might be another group of applied contributions using 
topic modeling methodology that is not cited within the explored domain. Addition-
ally, the focus on topic mining limits the scope of the review because the use of other 
content analysis approaches, such as document summarization, may be able to provide 
pointers for the research using topic models. Furthermore, due to the backward-for-
ward search approach used to find literature in the review, methodological contribu-
tions essentially have less of a chance of being discovered in the review. The frame-
work for hybrid sentiment analysis presented in Eickhoff (2015, 
paper II.2
) is limited 
by the domain portability of the sentiment dictionary used to create training data. Ad-
ditionally, the resulting model is inherently limited by the accuracy of the dictionary 
within a given domain. 
3.3
Research Area III: Analyst Opinion 
Methodological and theoretical limitations are present in Eickhoff and Muntermann 
(2016b, 
paper III.1
), which warrant discussion. There is no reliable way to determine 
Contributions 
99 
which portion of social media users are professional or “hobby” analysts, which makes 
the distinction between the two groups blurry. The available data do not enable insight 
into social media users’ social hierarchy, which may provide a more suitable measure 
of independence and authority as a precursor to crowd wisdom. Finally, the aggrega-
tion of social media users’ opinions to the singular sentiment measure sacrifices the 
diversity of the groups’ opinions. Other measures may well be more suitable to capture 
this diversity within the crowd. Beyond these methodological considerations, it is also 
important to remember that the presented results may be domain specific. The repro-
duction of a similar analysis for a non-economic, or at least not as explicitly financial, 
domains could provide an interesting comparison. Additionally, the presented study 
focused on 3 out of 5 constructs that the crowd wisdom theory proposes. Future studies 
should focus on trust and coordination as drivers of crowd wisdom, and the study only 
derives metrics for one of the two groups. 
The main limitation of Eickhoff and Muntermann (2017, 
paper III.2
) is given by the 
static nature of its model. This concerns both the chosen topic modeling approach and 
the market model-based abnormal return metric, which assumes a time-constant linear 
relationship between the reference index and the firm in question during the event pe-
riod. The topic modeling limitation could be mitigated using implementations of topic 
models, which allow for the trained classification to be updated in the face of new 
training data, enabling an evolution of the model over time (Blei and Lafferty, 2006; 
Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010). While the chosen return model appears prudent for the short 
event period used in the model, other techniques should be explored if longer event 
periods are of interest. Additionally, a larger company sample would likely improve 
upon the presented results. 
Regarding Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016c, 
paper III.3
), the main limitation of this 
short paper is given by the scope of its analysis. We examine the case of a single firm 
in this study. While there is a methodological reason for this (a cross-company trained 
topic model would be unlikely to work well for our analysis), validation of these results 
in future research using different samples is desirable. 
As discussed in Eickhoff (2017, 
paper III.4
), some of the topics that are identified by 
the chosen approach are industry specific. Thus, an extension of the chosen approach 
to a larger sample with industry specific topics is desirable. Additionally, the identified 
topics are time-constant, and a topic model can only identify topics that are previously 
contained in a corpus. Thus, entirely new topics will be missed and would be interest-
ing to add in the future. Furthermore, the observation count in the final regression 
models is limited by data availability regarding structured analyst consensus estimates. 
Like the inclusion of industry-specific topics, this may be mitigated by using a larger 
firm sample as the basis of the analysis.

Future Research 
4.1
Research Area I: Entrepreneurial Environment 
In this research area, a FinTech business model taxonomy was developed in Eickhoff 
et al. (2017, 
paper I.1
). As discussed, the aspiration to generalize the business models 
of all types of FinTech companies limits the granularity of both the dimensions and 
characteristics developed for this taxonomy. Thus, future research focusing on more 
specialized taxonomies may provide further insights. Additionally, more extensive use 
of the developed taxonomy is possible. For example, clustering can be performed on 
the characteristics assigned to each company as opposed to the approach chosen here: 
namely, to cluster the tags not used during taxonomy development as a confirmatory 
effort. This could help identify which combinations of characteristics are common and 
show patterns across diverse types of business models, identifying which roles are al-
ready being filled by companies and which are not. The dynamic development of the 
FinTech industry creates a need for future investigation. New companies may follow 
entirely different business models than those included in our dataset. Thus, future re-
search may focus on exploring whether the presented taxonomy still holds. 
4.2
Research Area II: Methodological 
The main implication for future research of this research area is given by the identifi-
cation of research gaps found in Eickhoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.1
). (M)IS has 
established itself as a reference discipline for other managerial fields regarding topic 
modeling methodology. The exploration of the theoretical foundations of the use and 
interpretation of topic models, as well as their capabilities regarding the generation 
and testing of social, economic and systems theory, present an opportunity to 
strengthen this referential role of IS. 
This is especially true when looking at the possibilities of topic modeling methodology 
in mixed method research designs, which combine the usefulness of topic modeling 
for analyzing large document collections and the intricacy of qualitative research de-
signs, which enable researchers to analyze content in much more detail but are prohib-
itively time consuming when applied to large document collections. 
Based on the framework for sentiment analysis presented in Eickhoff (2015, 
paper 
II.2
), a possible extension of the presented framework is given by integrating a stage 
for bootstrapping sentiment dictionaries. A semi-supervised approach to dictionary 
creation could be based on existing lexical databases such as 
SentiWordNet
(Baccian-
ella et al., 2010).

4.3
Research Area III: Analyst Opinion 
There are two distinct ways to extend on the results of Eickhoff and Muntermann 
(2016b, 
paper III.1
). First, the two remaining constructs of crowd wisdom theory that 
are not operationalized in this study due to a lack of data about them could be inte-
grated in the existing analysis to provide a more comprehensive picture of crowd wis-
dom in the studied domain. 
Second, while analysts have been treated as the opposite of the social media crowd in 
this study, they themselves resemble a crowd, and the criteria under which this crowd 
of analysts is especially effective could be studied. Indeed, many of the same data 
points used to operationalize the constructs of crowd wisdom theory regarding social 
media users are also available for the analyst side. For example, the names and em-
ployers of analysts are included in analyst reports, and the location from which a report 
is published is also known or discoverable. Additionally, the number of different ana-
lysts covering a firm at a given point in time is determinable, especially if 
I/B/E/S
data 
are used as a proxy, since the database makes the number of covering analysts readily 
available. Thus, the setting of Eickhoff and Muntermann (2016b,
paper III.1
) could 
be extended to compare two different types of crowds. Additionally, the study could 
be extended upon by adopting topic modeling as another technique for analyzing the 
two content types to study the topics for which each group is favored. 
On the basis of the results presented in Eickhoff and Muntermann (2017, 
paper III.2
), 
the presented approach to information complexity reduction could be combined with 
other approaches, such as rule-based filtering. Furthermore, information overload is a 
relevant problem beyond the financial domain. Consequently, other domains could be 
studied using similar approaches. The main task in such a domain transfer of the pre-
sented approach is finding a decision-relevant metric, such as stock returns in the fi-
nancial case. 
Three areas of possible future research are identified in Eickhoff and Muntermann 
(2016c, 
paper III.3
). First, the presented approach can be transferred to other content 
domains. One domain that could benefit from such an approach is marketing research, 
where the transmission of topics introduced in a marketing campaign through user-
generated content could be of interest. Because the main requirement for the presented 
approach is the availability of historical training data and because the marketing re-
search already uses analyzed social media content, this appears to be a small hurdle in 
this domain. 
Second, the level of analysis could be shifted towards a more granular inspection of 
the behavior of individual topics. Because this research only focused on document-
Contributions 
102 
level topic similarity, this extension would both be methodologically feasible and in-
teresting in the context of analyst opinion because there may be some topics that do 
not follow the conference-call-to-analyst-report transfer pattern that is shown in this 
research. Such a granular analysis could also contribute on a theoretical level because 
it could provide more insights on analyst herding behavior based on the topic. Another 
interesting question regarding the behavior of individual topics is given by the question 
of whether topics introduced by the analysts in the Q&A part of the call, which were 
not present in the presentation part of call, are more likely to have a long-lasting impact 
on the topic structure of reports or an immediate market reaction. 
Third, the presented approach can be extended to more than two content types at once. 
One reason to be interested in such an extension is the fact that the presented approach 
cannot prove that a topic transfer occurred but only that one content type adopted the 
same topic after the other. This does not preclude that both content types adopt topics 
from a third or multiple other content domains and only differ in their information 
processing speed. Thus, an extension beyond two content types is desirable because 
financial analysts are, as their name suggests, interpreters of information and are not 
the originators of the information themselves. 
Finally, the results presented in Eickhoff (2017, 
paper III.4
) present several avenues 
of future research regarding the effects of media richness on information transmission 
in the financial domain. This study could be extended using a larger company sample, 
enabling the analysis of industry-specific effects regarding earnings announcements 
and their relationship to low- and high-richness media types. Additionally, other non-
analyst-authored media types could be of interest to such an extension. Furthermore, 
because the model in this contribution is time constant, which contradicts the reality 
of ever-changing topics in companies’ ongoing operations, a more adaptive topic 
model could be used to reflect the changes in the situation of firms over time. Indeed, 
adaptive topic models are available (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), as is discussed in Eick-
hoff and Neuss (2017, 
paper II.2
). This adaptive modeling would also make the anal-
ysis more resistant to market shocks, such as economic crises. Another extension could 
be made by studying the effects of the opinions of individual analysts or analyst-em-
ployers because person- or firm-level data are available in the database used. 
In summary, regarding all studies presented in this third research area of the thesis, 
comparisons between the effectiveness of other content analysis techniques are an in-
teresting avenue for future research. For example, vector representations of textual 
content have recently risen in popularity (Le and Mikolov, 2014) and offer another 
interesting approach to the task of creating compressed representations of document 
content. Methodological comparisons would also reduce the risk of method bias in the 
presented results (Podsakoff et al., 2003).
