Abstract
In this research the impact of media-richness on 
the investor reaction to earnings announcements is 
investigated. To this end, unstructured (high-richness) 
sources of analyst opinion are subjected to text-mining 
and combined with structured (low-richness) sources 
of analyst opinion, as well as other commonly used 
structured data relevant to company performance. 
Results indicate that equivocality is a major problem 
faced by investors, while uncertainty as understood by 
media-richness theory appears to be less dominant. 
1.
Introduction 
The 
quarterly 
earnings 
announcements 
of 
publically 
traded 
companies 
pose 
significant 
challenges 
for 
both 
academia 
and 
investors 
alike. 
Research regarding this quarterly ritual is extensive 
and often concerns the impact of the newly revealed 
information 
on 
the 
expectations 
of 
investors. 
Meanwhile, investors face a more ad-hoc decision 
problem. They need to decide whether to buy, to hold, 
or to sell a share on the ground of so far announced 
information. 
In 
todays 
networked 
society, 
many 
information sources are available to investors. Among 
those, the variant opinions of stock analysts are a key 
source of analysis regarding past and future company 
performance. However, these opinions are available 
over a multitude of channels including both financial 
information 
systems, 
which 
provide 
structured 
recommendations, telephone earnings calls, which are 
publically available in most jurisdictions, and analyst 
reports, which interested investors can purchase. This 
poses a selection problem for investors: Which of 
these sources are (is) most important regarding the 
investment 
decision? 
This 
research 
addresses 
that 
decision problem using media richness theory as a 
background on which different media types can be 
evaluated regarding a number of criteria. Furthermore, 
media richness theory provides pointers on what kind 
of media type (rich or less rich) is more efficient, given 
the presence of uncertainty and equivocality in any 
given decision problem. On this basis, the available 
media types are evaluated and tested regarding their 
explanatory 
power 
as 
to 
historical 
investment 
decisions, which are measured as the abnormal stock 
return following earnings announcements. Section 2 
provides a brief introduction to recent finance and 
accounting research concerning earnings releases and 
the related sources of analyst opinion Following, it 
discusses the relation of media richness theory to the 
investment decision problem. Section 3 introduces the 
data used in the following analysis. Section 4 gives a 
methodological overview and shows how sentiment 
analysis, topic-mining and the estimation of abnormal 
returns are performed as a basis for this research. 
Consequently, section 5 shows how the analysis is 
performed and presents its results. Section 6 discusses 
the implication of the presented results before this 
research is concluded in section 7. 
2. Theory 
2.1. Analyst opinion 
Earnings 
releases 
in 
general 
and 
earnings 
call 
transcripts in particular have been studied regarding 
their information content by continuous streams of 
accounting 
and 
finance 
research. 
Previous 
work 
focusses 
on 
structured 
information 
regarding 
the 
earnings 
release 
itself 
and 
non-textual 
measures 
regarding the earnings call. The information content of 
earnings announcements have been found to be stable 
over several decades regarding both abnormal trading 
volume and return volatility [1-3]. More recently, 
research focusses on textual measures derived from 
the transcripts of earnings’ calls. Commonly, studies 
use wordlists based measures to capture call tone [4]. 
Also, a lack of spontaneity in management responses 
to 
analyst 
questions 
in 
earnings 
calls 
has 
been 
investigated [4]. Furthermore, investment reaction to 
analyst tone is usually stronger than to management 
tone [1]. In line with these findings, positive tone 
increases the effect of positive earnings surprise [5]. 
Moreover earnings forecasts published by analysts 
who participated in earnings’ calls immediately after

them 
are 
more 
accurate 
than 
those 
published 
by 
analysts who did not participate [6]. It has been shown 
that allowing analysts to participate in conference calls 
gives them access to private information, even though 
the calls are public, and management can use such 
measures to discriminate against unfavorable analysts 
in earnings calls [7]. Still, earnings calls have been 
found to be a valuable source of information for 
investors. 
Likewise, the reports and non-earnings’ 
calls related forecasts released by stock analysts have 
been subject to continuous interest by accounting and 
finance researchers. As is the case in the area of 
earnings’ announcements, earlier research focused on 
structured recommendations released by analysts. One 
source for these structured analyst opinions is given by 
the institutional broker estimate system (I/B/E/S), in 
which 
analysts 
publish 
and 
continuously 
update 
estimates on numerous financial indicators related to a 
company’s performance. On the basis of such data, 
research has shown that mean forecasts (the average 
opinion 
of 
all 
analysts 
submitting 
an 
estimate) 
overemphasizes the common information all analysts 
share over the private information that makes the 
estimates interesting in the first place [8]. In addition 
analysts with historically more accurate forecasts are 
more likely to make bold predictions (as opposed to 
sticking to the consensus estimate) than those with 
poorer forecast accuracy in their past [9]. 
Like the purely earnings related analyst opinion 
research, 
this 
research 
stream 
has 
also 
begun 
to 
analyze textual analyst opinions, which are presented 
in analyst reports and examined the choice of peer 
companies used by sell-side equity analysts [10]. On 
the same note it’s showing that report readability 
correlates with analyst capability [11]. It has also been 
shown that report tone can provide excess information 
beyond structured forecasts [12].

As this overview of research on analyst opinion 
shows, 
research 
regarding 
the 
textual 
sources 
of 
analyst opinion has begun, but so far has mainly 
focused on the augmentation of traditional models 
regarding the accuracy and impact of analyst opinion. 
As shown by this prior research, this textual content 
can improve upon the structured recommendations 
given by analysts through I/B/E/S and similar systems. 
This research contributes towards this growing corpus 
of knowledge by investigating two of the reasons why 
this is so using established IS theory. Furthermore, 
topic-mining is used to extract information about the 
impact of specific topics discussed in both analyst 
reports and earnings calls. In this study, the investor 
reaction to the release of quarterly earnings will be 
considered in conjunction with the release of analyst 
reports and estimates for earnings surprise. Figure 1 
shows this basis for investment decisions following 
earnings announcements. 
2.2. Media Richness Theory: 
Media Richness Theory as proposed by Daft and 
Lengel analyzes the effectiveness of different media 
types 
regarding 
the 
transportation 
of 
information 
between different individuals or organizations [13]. It 
argues that in order to convey information effectively 
the transport medium needs to match the complexity 
of the transmitted information regarding four core 
criteria: (1) Language variety, (2) multiplicity of cues 
(channel variety), (3) personalization (source), and (4) 
feedback 
immediacy. 
Language 
variety
does 
not 
necessarily 
refer 
to 
the 
use 
of 
different 
natural 
languages but the mediums’ capability to transmit a 
wide spectrum of concepts and ideas. For example, 
Daft and Lengel list music and art as media with a high 
language variety in their seminal work on the subject, 
as opposed to mathematics as an example of a low 
variety 
language. 
Cue 
multiplicity
alludes 
to 
the 
variety in channels through which a medium transmits 
information. In example, face-to-face communication 
offers 
more 
channels 
(facial 
expressions, 
audio, 
visual) than a phone call (audio). 
Personalization
or 
the source of communication refers to the soft factor 
of being able to interact with another person instead of 
a 
machine 
or 
written 
communication. 
Finally, 
feedback immediacy
extends this notion by allowing 
to 
correct 
faulty 
perceptions 
by 
the 
recipient 
of 
transmitted 
information. 
If 
a 
medium 
ranks 
high 
across these categories, it is considered rich. Based 
upon this richness categorization the theory argues that 
rich media types perform superior to less rich media 
types in equivocal tasks, while less rich media types 
can support information transmission in the presence 
of uncertainty [14]. Uncertainty categorizes situations 
in which a decision maker has not been supplied with 
enough information to reach a well based decision. 
Equivocality 
describes 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
the 
decision maker is faced with numerous and possibly 
1433
conflicting sources of information, making it difficult 
to 
reach 
a 
firm 
decision 
[15, 
16]. 
Earnings 
announcements present both uncertain and equivocal 
problems to decision makers (investors). On the one 
hand, 
the 
investor 
wants 
to 
assess 
the 
future 
performance of a 
company 
based on information, 
which in the best case presents the current state of the 
company. As all predictions are, this assessment is 
highly uncertain. On the other hand, the investor is 
faced with numerous opinions pertaining to the subject 
at once. The management of a company will often 
interpret 
a 
given 
situation 
differently 
than 
stock 
analysts, media, or the investor. Consequently, the 
information 
presented 
to 
the 
investor 
is 
highly 
equivocal. Assuming both of these assumptions hold 
true, media richness theory suggests that there is good 
reason to listen to both low and high richness media 
types 
regarding 
earnings 
announcements. 
Low 
richness media types may help to reduce uncertainty, 
while 
high 
richness 
media 
types 
may 
mitigate 
equivocality. 
This 
leads 
to 
the 
question 
if 
the 
hypothesized effects are measurable in media types 
related to earnings announcements. To address this 
question, 
the 
following 
research 
Questions 
are 
proposed: 
RQ1
: 
Do 
low 
richness 
media 
types 
transmit 
investment-relevant 
information 
regarding 
earnings 
announcements, i.e. does low media complexity help 
to 
investors 
to 
reduce 
uncertainty 
after 
earnings 
announcements? 
RQ2:
Do 
high 
richness 
media 
types 
transmit 
investment-relevant 
information 
regarding 
earnings 
announcements, i.e. do increased language variety, 
cue 
multiplicity, 
personalization 
and 
feedback 
immediacy in their union increase the information 
content of materials related to earnings announcement 
by 
reducing 
equivocality? 
These 
isolated 
considerations 
naturally 
lead 
to 
a 
third 
question 
considering the combination of both high and low 
richness media types: 
RQ3:
What is the incremental value of high and 
low 
richness 
media 
types 
when 
their 
antipode 
is 
already being considered? 
3. Structured, unstructured Data and 
their Relation to Media Richness Theory 
In this section the data types used in the following 
analysis are presented. In the context of media richness 
theory, 
structured 
and 
unstructured 
data 
can 
be 
considered as extreme representations of low and high 
richness media types. Typically, structured data is 
highly formalized and consequently scores low in the 
discussed 
categories, 
assessing 
media 
richness. 
In 
contrast, unstructured data typically consists of higher 
richness media types, such as earnings call transcripts 
and analyst reports in our case. Thus, sources of 
structured and unstructured data can serve as proxies 
for low and high richness media types. All data used 
in this study is obtained from Thompson Reuters’ 
Datastream 
and 
Advanced 
Analytics 
(TRAA) 
platforms. 
3.1. Low Richness (Structured Data) 
Three kinds of low richness data sources of interest 
to investors are investigated in this study. First, the 
stock price of companies in the sample is collected. 
Secondly, 
several 
balance 
sheet 
related 
variables, 
commonly used in relation to earnings announcements 
are added to augment the stock price. Finally, several 
analyst 
consensus 
estimates 
are 
collected 
from 
I/B/E/S, 
which 
reflect 
the 
mean 
estimates 
of 
all 
analysts who had submitted their opinion about each 
variable on the call date. Table 1 provides a detailed 
description of each collected variable. Prior research 
regarding the effects of analyst opinion on investor 
behavior shows that investors do listen to this low-
richness 
information 
source. 
For 
example, 
trading 
strategies based on the consensus estimate have been 
analyzed [17], as have the effects of boldness on 
forecast accuracy [18].

3.2. High Richness (Unstructured Data) 
Two sources of unstructured analyst opinion data 
are used in the following analysis. Both were collected 
from 
Thompson 
Reuters 
Advanced 
Analytics 
(TRAA). Both analyst reports and earnings conference 
calls have been studied regarding to their effect on 
investor behavior. Analyst reports have been studied 
regarding the market reaction to their release [19], the 
effect of their readability on abnormal trading volumes 
[11], 
and 
effect 
of 
report 
ambiguity 
on 
investor 
reaction 
[20]. 
Likewise, 
investors’ 
reactions 
to 
earnings conference calls have been studied in regard 
to the link between effects of call tone and investor 
sophistication [5], as well as the effects of call tone on 
abnormal returns [21]. As these prior studies have 
repeatedly shown, these sources of unstructured but 
high-richness media often lead to significant investor 
reactions. Thus, both low- and high-richness media 
sources have been shown to be feasible predictors for 
investor behavior. The following data are used in this 
analysis. At first, analyst reports about the companies 
included 
in 
the 
Dow 
Jones 
Industrial 
Average 
(DJIA
30
) 
between 
2003 
and 
2016 
were 
collected. 
These analyst reports typically contain a review of the 
current financial situation of the company and an 
estimate 
of 
its 
future 
development, 
in 
a 
mixture 
between freely 
written text 
as well as tables and 
figures. 
Figure 3: Earnings Call Structure. 
This paper focuses on analyzing the freely written 
portion of the reports and consequently extracting the 
textual content of each document for further analysis. 
Second, the transcripts of all earnings calls for the 
same period were collected. Earnings calls typically 
consist 
of 
two 
separate 
segments. 
First, 
the 
management of the company holding the call presents 
the earnings announcement in form of a monologue of 
the CEO or CFO. Second, analysts ask questions about 
the 
announcement 
or 
other 
topics 
of 
interest 
for 
possible future company performance. Figure 3 gives 
an 
overview 
of 
this 
structure. 
Three 
types 
of 
contribution 
to 
the 
call, 
i.e. 
presentation 
by 
the 
corporation, questions by analysts, and answers by the 
corporation, 
are 
extracted 
to 
calculate 
separate 
measures for each. If a call does not exhibit all three 
segments it was dropped from the sample. Figure 2 
shows the annual counts for each media type. In the 
case of the earnings calls 120 per year is the natural 
limit for a 30 company (DJIA
30
) sample (one call per 
quarterly 
earnings 
per 
year). 
As 
shown, 
data 
are 
available continuously for the analyzed period with a 
notable reduction in the report count during the global 
financial crisis (~2008). 
4. Method 
In this section, an overview of the methodologies 
and tools utilized in this paper will be provided. First, 
the text mining methods used to extract variables from 
textual content are elaborated. Second, the abnormal 
return model is developed. Finally, the commonly 
used 
methods 
to 
analyze 
the 
resulting 
data 
are 
presented.

overview on the opinions and feelings of their authors. 
Both supervised and unsupervised learning has been 
applied to this field of content analysis [22]. While 
both approaches have been used with success, clearly 
certain trade-offs exist using either. On the one hand, 
supervised learning can offer excellent accuracy but 
domain-portability poses a challenge [23]. On the 
other hand, dictionary based (unsupervised) sentiment 
scoring 
is 
inherently 
limited 
by 
the 
dictionary 
of 
sentiment laden words texts are compared to, resulting 
in 
the 
need 
for 
domain-appropriate 
sentiment 
dictionaries [24]. As this analysis intends to asses both 
analyst 
reports 
and 
earnings 
call 
transcripts 
and 
finance specific sentiment dictionaries are available, 
the 
dictionary 
based 
approach 
is 
chosen. 
Two 
dictionaries to score both types of texts were chosen, a 
general purpose dictionary developed by Hu and Liu 
with Positive and Negative categories [25] and a 
finance specific dictionary developed by Loughran 
and 
McDonald 
(LMD) 
with 
Positive, 
Negative, 
Litigious, 
Modal-Weak, 
Modal-Strong 
and 
Uncertainty categories [26]. In the case of analyst 
reports, a 30-day report sample prior to each earnings 
call event is averaged regarding these categories. For 
the calls themselves, the three discussed segments are 
scored individually for each call. 
4.2. Topic Mining 
In contrast to sentiment analysis, topic mining aims 
to extract what is being said in a document and not 
how 
authors 
feel 
about 
a 
specific 
topic. 
Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (Table 2) [27, 28] is a topic 
mining 
algorithm 
and 
generates 
a 
pre-determined 
number 
of 
topics 
in 
a 
document 
collection 
D
consisting of a vector of documents 
w
, each of which 
consists of 
N
individual words w
n
. A topic z
n
is 
represented as a mixture of the words contained in the 
document collection. In turn, each topic is assigned to 
each document with a certain probability. For the 
purpose of our analysis the topic-assignments to each 
earnings call in the sample and the average of the topic 
assignments to all analyst reports 30 days prior to the 
call date (equivalent to the sentiment measures) are 
computed using the MALLET topic mining package 
[28]. For the calls themselves, topics are computed for 
the 
entire 
call 
and 
not 
for 
the 
three 
individual 
segments. The main reason behind this is, that the 
Q&A portion of the call often contains very short text 
parts, i.e. short questions which are asked by analysts 
often receive short answers, and consequently are not 
as suited for being analyzed by using LDA on each 
individual text. The topic model is trained on all 
textual data at once, i.e. both analyst reports and the 
conference call transcripts are used as training data.

i.e. the multinomial conditional

. 
The model is set to identify 100 topics. The number 
of topics is the crucial model parameter in our case. If 
the parameter is chosen too low, the resulting topics 
lack granularity if it is chosen too high the resulting 
topics are increasingly indistinguishable for humans. 
As noted, a topic consists of the likelihood that each 
word in the corpus is part of the topic. Consequently, 
topics can be very similar in regard to their most likely 
words but very different in their overall composition, 
consequently making them hard to distinguish. The 
number of 100 topics is determined by experiments 
keeping this trade-off in mind and seems reasonable as 
this relatively high number of topics helps to avoid 
company 
specific 
topics, 
i.e. 
topics 
that 
simply 
classify a text regarding the company it belongs to. To 
validate 
the 
number 
of 
chosen 
topics, 
a 
HDP 
(hierarchical dirichlet process) model [29] was trained 
using Gensim [30]. This model, depending on the 
cutoff-likelihood (relative importance of one topic 
compared to others), points to 80-95 topics as the 
‘optimal’ amount. As the following analysis uses a 
variable selection approach, choosing a slightly higher 
number seems reasonable as superfluous topics will 
not 
be 
included 
in 
the 
resulting 
models. 
Another 
option 
is 
to 
train 
the 
topic 
model 
dependent 
on 
companies or industries with lower individual topic 
numbers. The main reason this was not done here is 
that it would result in topics that do not allow for inter-
company 
or 
inter-industry 
comparisons 
of 
topic 
impacts. 
4.3. Abnormal Returns 
The analysis of the investment decisions following 
an earnings announcement aims to capture the reaction 
of the average investor to said announcement. It is 
important to keep in mind that only changes in opinion 
can be measured on the stock market. In general, three 
possible reactions to an earnings announcement are 
conceivable. 
First, 
an 
investor 
can 
be 
positively 
surprised by the announcement and consequently buy 
the share. Second, the opposite reaction follows a

negative surprise. However, if an investor does not 
change her opinion and consequently does not alter her 
position 
regarding 
a 
stock, 
no 
trade 
occurs 
and 
consequently no change in price can be observed on 
the market. Nonetheless, both negative and positive 
changes in opinion should lead to a change in the 
investors’ 
position 
and 
consequently 
would 
be 
observable on the market. Thus, the measurement is 
strictly 
limited 
to 
the 
unexpected 
portion 
of 
the 
information contained in an earnings announcement. 
In order to monitor the aggregate change in investor 
opinions, 
after 
an 
earnings 
announcement, 
the 
abnormal return of a company’s share after the event 
can serve as a proxy. This approach to measuring 
investor 
opinion 
relies 
on 
the 
efficient 
market 
hypothesis, which stipulates that any new information 
should be represented in the stock price immediately 
[31, 32]. In order to monitor the abnormal component 
of returns following an event, an expectation of the 
normal return for the same period in the absence of the 
event needs to be formulated and the abnormal return 
is defined as the difference between observed and 
expected returns following the event:

using -200 days up to -1 day prior to 
the earnings announcement as training data for the 
return model. This yields the abnormal return for a 
given 
day, 
starting 
with 
the 
day 
of 
the 
earnings 
announcement itself. Indeed, both AR
t0
to AR
t10
and 
cumulative return measures (CARs) were calculated 
for the sample. AR
0
, the abnormal returns on the day 
of the earnings call, was most suitable for the analysis 
and consequently is used as the independent variable 
for the resulting models. 
4.4. Topic Selection 
As noted, the topic model trained on earnings call 
transcripts and analyst reports is used to compute the 
topic composition for each call transcript in the sample 
and 
the 
average 
topic 
composition 
of 
all 
analyst 
reports released 30 days prior to the call. As each of 
these two topic groups consists of 100 topics, this 
alone 
results 
in 
numerous 
topic-variables 
per 
call 
event. As it is infeasible to use all 200 topic-variables 
in 
the 
following 
regression 
models 
and 
more 
importantly it is unknown which topics computed by 
the model, are of interest to investors, a selection needs 
to be performed. A two-step approach to this selection 
problem 
is 
chosen. 
First, 
a 
topic 
set 
suitable 
for 
regression 
is 
identified 
using 
the 
least 
absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [34], which 
selects a subset of variables out of the pool of topics. 
The sentiment based variables are also supplied to the 
LASSO. The selected sentiment variables are those 
included in the regression models in Table 4. Second, 
because 
automated 
variable 
selection 
by 
itself 
is 
problematic, 
the 
resulting 
topic 
set 
is 
manually 
inspected as a sanity check. The coding is performed 
by looking at the top 20 words for each topic (10 
displayed for space reasons). The resulting topic set is 
displayed in Table 3. As shown, a label is assigned to 
each topic by coding the top words of each selected 
topic. The type column indicates whether the topic was 
selected to be relevant in calls (C), analyst reports (R), 
or both. This has two purposes: Firstly, only topics, 
which are interpretable, should be used for further 
analysis. Secondly, it helps to make the following 
regression models easier to read, by replacing the topic 
numbers with the resulting codes. As shown, a mixture 
of topics indicating discussions of both financial topics 
and company or industry specific topics was selected. 
This points to the possibility of estimating the topic

models on industry specific samples to generate 
more 
granularity. 
However, 
this 
would 
require 
a 
dataset covering a larger index than the DJIA because 
within this index only a couple of companies per 
industry are represented. 
5. Analysis and Results 
The topics selected using the described approach 
are 
combined 
with 
the 
variables 
obtained 
from 
structured data sources and for all variables z-scores 
are computed (
𝑧 = (𝑥 − 𝜇)/𝜎
) in order to normalize 
the scale of the variables. It is important to keep this 
step 
in 
mind 
when 
interpreting 
the 
following 
regression models since the coefficients refer to the 
deviation 
from 
the 
mean 
of 
each 
variable, 
i.e. 
a 
negative coefficient refers to a value smaller than the 
average value of the variable and vice-versa. All calls 
on which the full set of variables could not be obtained 
were dropped from the sample. This mainly concerns 
two types of missing variables. First, calls for which no 
more than 5 reports were available 30 days prior to the 
earnings release were dropped in order to obtain better 
averages. 
Second, 
the 
I/B/E/S 
estimates 
were 
not 
available for earlier years. In principle, some calls 
could 
be 
reintegrated 
after 
variable 
selection 
is 
performed but the smaller sample size is kept as this 
seemed like the cleaner approach. In order to analyze 
the data with regard to the research questions three 
models need to be estimated. The first model (M1) 
only 
contains 
variables 
from 
the 
structured 
data 
sources and addresses RQ1 (Do low richness media 
types transmit investment relevant information?). The 
second model (M2) only contains variables estimated 
from unstructured data and addresses RQ2 (Do high 
richness 
media 
types 
transmit 
investment 
relevant 
information?). The third model (M3) contains both 
types of variables addresses RQ3 (What incremental 
value can be gained by combining both low and high 
richness media types?). Regarding the interpretation of 
these models and their connection to the research 
questions 
three 
aspects 
are 
of 
particular 
interest. 
Firstly, 
the 
coefficient 
sizes 
within 
the 
individual 
models and their stability (especially regarding their 
sign) across the models. Secondly, which coefficients 
are 
significant 
across 
the 
different 
models? 
And 
thirdly, and most interestingly, how to the models 
1438
compare to one another on the model level. Table 4 
shows the three resulting models. 
Regarding 
M1
media richness theory predicts that 
low-richness 
media 
types 
should 
help 
information 
transmission 
by 
mitigating 
issues 
of 
uncertainty 
(
RQ1
). 
As 
M1 
contains 
such 
low-richness 
information, it should be able to explain the investment 
decisions 
following 
earnings 
announcements 
if 
uncertainty is a relevant problem for this decision. As 
shown, the adjusted R
2
of this model is comparatively 
small, 
indicating 
that 
the 
variables 
obtained 
from 
structured data are not able to explain much of the 
variance within the abnormal returns on the call day. 
Keeping this in mind, both price to book ratio and 
unconsolidated market capitalization show significant 
positive effects, while return on equity surprise mean 
and 
consolidated 
market 
capitalization 
exhibit 
negative 
effects. 
Overall, 
while 
the 
examined 
structured 
data 
offers 
some 
insight 
regarding 
the 
investment decisions following the earnings call, the 
comparatively small adjusted R
2
(3.8%) points at a 
small effect of uncertainty as described by media 
richness theory for this decision type. 
Regarding 
M2 
media richness theory predicts that 
high-richness media types should help information 
transmission 
by 
mitigating 
issues 
of 
equivocality 
(
RQ2
). 
Thus, 
M2 
should 
be 
able 
to 
explain 
the 
investment 
decisions 
following 
earnings 
announcements if equivocality is a relevant problem 
for 
decision 
makers. 
As 
shown, 
the 
adjusted 
R
2
(31.8%) 
of 
this 
model 
is 
comparatively 
large, 
indicating 
that 
the 
variables 
extracted 
from 
unstructured content explain a larger portion of the 
variance within abnormal stock returns on the earnings 
call day. Thus, these unstructured data sources seem to 
transmit more investment relevant information when 
compared to the structured data sources contained in 
M1. Within the framework of media richness theory 
this points to equivocality regarding the interpretation 
of 
earnings 
announcements 
as 
a 
major 
problem 
investors need to mitigate using high-richness media 
sources. Within the topics of analyst reports released 
in a period of 30 days before the earnings calls several 
topics are identified that allude toward a positive effect 
of 
the 
earnings 
announcement. 
In 
particular, 
the 
discussion of earnings, investments and sports (likely 
and industry specific topic) show positive coefficients. 
Likewise, the discussion of financial data and market 
activity in the call itself shows positive effects. Finally, 
strong modal words from the LMD word list used by 
analysts in their Q&A questions relate to positive post-
call returns. 
On the other hand, reports containing credit cards, 
corporate 
agreements, 
chemical 
products, 
pharma 
research and prudence exhibit negative effects. Of 
these, 
especially 
the 
prudence 
topic 
is 
interesting 
because 
it 
isn’t 
as 
industry 
specific 
as 
the 
other 
negative 
topics. 
Finally, 
negative 
words 
used 
by 
analysts in their Q&A questions 
show 
a 
negative 
relation to returns. Overall, this model explains a much 
larger 
portion 
of 
return 
variance 
than 
the 
one 
incorporating 
traditional 
structured 
data, 
thus 
indicating 
that 
equivocality 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
bigger 
problem than uncertainty regarding the investment 
decisions after earnings calls. Finally,
M3
combines 
both low- and high-richness media types in one model 
and 
investigates 
the 
complementary 
value 
of 
this 
combination beyond the value of the individual models 
(
RQ3
). As shown, this model slightly improves upon 
the adjusted R
2 
from 31.8% to 34.8%, which means the 
improvement is slightly smaller than the adjusted R
2
of 
M1. This finding is in line with the intention of the 
measure, 
which 
penalizes 
models 
including 
more 
covariates. With regard to RQ3, this relatively small 
improvement over M2 may be interpreted as a small 
incremental 
value 
of 
combining 
low- 
and 
high-
richness 
media 
types. 
However, 
keeping 
the 
limitations of the chosen text mining approaches in 
mind, which do not extract all information contained 
in 
the 
unstructured 
data, 
it 
is 
doubtful, 
if 
this 
incremental value would be present if an informed 
investor actually reads the analyst reports and listens to 
the earnings call. Both of the above also may contain 
the relevant information contained in the structured 
data 
sources. 
Thus, 
the 
incremental 
value 
of 
the 
combined model can be doubted. Still, it can serve as 
a stability check for M2. As shown, the addition of the 
variables contained in M1 does not alter the sign of the 
significant 
variables 
of 
M2. 
The 
only 
change 
in 
covariate significance is given by the pharma research 
topic, which is not significant in M2 but is in M3. 
In summary, the models indicate a low impact of 
uncertainty 
for 
post-earnings 
call 
investment 
decisions, while providing much clearer evidence for 
the impact of equivocality. Finally, the incremental 
value of the combination of low- and high-richness 
media types is doubtful if the low impact of uncertainty 
as 
understood 
by 
media 
richness 
theory 
and 
the 
information 
likely 
contained 
in 
the 
unstructured 
content but not captured by text-mining approaches are 
kept in mind. 
6. Implications and Limitations 
The implications of the presented results can be 
spilt 
up 
into 
practical, 
theoretical 
and 
policy 
implications. From a 
practical
perspective, investors 
should focus both on analyst reports and earnings calls 
as their primary sources of information regarding the 
impact of earnings announcements, if no automation is 
required or text mining is feasible. Still, when this is 
not the case the available structured data can support 
investment 
decisions. 
Even 
when 
these 
reports 
explained much less of the variance within abnormal 
1439
returns in this study. Also, as also shown by other 
studies 
[1, 
2, 
5, 
21, 
35], 
the 
presented 
analysis 
reinforces the crucial effect of call and report tone 
towards 
investor 
reaction. 
The 
theoretical
contribution of this study is twofold. First, its results 
contribute 
towards 
the 
growing 
body 
of 
research 
regarding the impact of unstructured, high-richness, 
media types in accounting and finance research by 
exploring the feasibility of topic-mining within the 
problem 
domain 
of 
earnings 
announcements. 
Secondly, it contributes towards the discussion of 
media richness theory and its applications by exploring 
the effects of uncertainty and equivocality in regard to 
the same problem domain. On a whole results indicate 
that 
equivocality 
presents 
a 
major 
challenge 
to 
investors. Finally, results indicate that 
policy
makers 
should keep a watchful eye on the private information 
gained by analysts because of their privileged access to 
top 
level 
corporate 
representatives 
as 
the 
high 
correlation 
to 
abnormal 
post-earnings 
returns 
may 
point to the presence of such private information (or 
analysts simply to a good job). The presented results 
should be interpreted only while keeping the following 
limitations in mind. As shown, some of the topics that 
are identified by the chosen approach are industry 
specific. Thus, an extension of the chosen approach to 
a 
larger 
sample 
with 
industry 
specific 
topics 
is 
desirable. Also, the identified topics are time-constant 
and a topic model can only identify topics, which are 
previously contained in a corpus. Thus, entirely new 
topics will be missed and would be interesting to add 
in the future. Furthermore, the observation count in the 
final regression models is limited by data availability 
regarding structured analyst consensus estimates. Like 
the inclusion of industry specific topics, this could 
possibly be mitigated, by using a larger index as the 
basis of the analysis (data collection would pose a 
significant hurdle to such an extension). 
6.1. Future research 
The discussed limitations and presented results 
outline 
several 
avenues 
for 
future 
research. 
First, 
future 
research 
can 
examine 
the 
industry 
specific 
effects 
of 
analyst 
opinion 
on 
investor 
reaction 
to 
earnings announcement and their relation to low and 
rich media types. Secondly, many other media types 
are of interest to investors. In example, social media 
has been used to explain stock returns [36]. Also, the 
audio versions of earnings calls present an opportunity 
to work with higher-richness media than with their 
transcripts. Furthermore, as noted in the limitations, 
the presented topic model does treat all calls and report 
equally 
over 
time. 
However, 
of 
course 
the 
topics 
discussed in earnings calls and analyst reports change 
over time. For example, during the global economic 
crisis call topics were likely much more negative than 
the model based on all data can represent and vice-
versa. This point of topic sentiment hints at another 
possible extension. The per-topic sentiment of analyst 
opinion represents a final possible addition to the 
presented approach. Finally, other topic modelling 
techniques, dynamic topic models [37], exist and a 
comparison of their suitability for post earnings call 
return 
analysis 
provides 
an 
opportunity 
for 
future 
research. 
7. Conclusion 
This study examined the impact of earnings-call 
related 
low- 
(structured) 
and 
high-richness 
(unstructured) content on abnormal stock returns on 
the earnings-call day before the background of media 
richness theory. Results indicate that uncertainty poses 
a smaller challenge to investors than equivocality, i.e. 
that the decision problem of investors is dominated not 
by a lack of clarity or information availability but a 
lack of consensus among the available information 
sources. Furthermore, the complementary 
value of 
combining 
low- 
and 
high-richness 
media 
types 
is 
examined but results regarding this combination are 
unclear. 
While 
combined 
models 
show 
minor 
improvements over one only including high-richness 
media, it is doubtful if this improvement would be 
present if investors manually examine high-richness 
media 
sources. 
Additionally, 
results 
reinforce 
the 
evidence for the relation between analyst tone and 
investor reaction to analyst opinion and explore topic-
mining as another information extraction technique 
that can aid in understanding the content of analyst 
communication.
