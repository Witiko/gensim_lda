Abstract 
Over the last decade, quantitative text mining approaches to content analysis have gained increasing 
traction within information systems research, and related fields, such as business administration. Re-
cently, topic models, which are supposed to provide their user with an overview of themes being dis-
cussed in documents, have gained popularity. However, while convenient tools for the creation of this 
model class exist, the evaluation of topic models poses significant challenges to their users. In this 
research, we investigate how questions of model validity and trustworthiness of presented analyses are 
addressed across disciplines. We accomplish this by providing a structured review of methodological 
approaches across the Financial Times 50 journal ranking. We identify 59 methodological research 
papers, 24 implementations of topic models, as well as 33 research papers using topic models in In-
formation Systems (IS) research, and 29 papers using such models in other managerial disciplines. 
Results indicate a need for model implementations usable by a wider audience, as well as the need for 
more implementations of model validation techniques, and the need for a discussion about the theoret-
ical foundations of topic modelling based research. 
Keywords: Topic Modelling, Literature Review, Model Validation

Introduction 
The rise of social media platforms and the availability of news online have created textual “big data”, 
which has outgrown the feasibility of in-depth qualitative analysis. Quantitative methods to the analy-
sis of textual data, such as sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012), have consequently become an established 
tool in the methodological spectrum of information systems research. Recent developments, such as 
efforts towards a “web of data”, will only increase the need for an automated analysis of textual con-
tent (W3C, 2013). Among the approaches to analyzing large document collections, topic models, such 
as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003), have recently gained traction in applied (non-
methodological) research. Debortoli et al. (2016) provide a tutorial for using topic modelling as a tool 
in information systems research and provide readers with an example analysis showcasing the use of 
this model class. The recent focus on topic modelling as a quantitative research method has enabled 
researchers to address questions that previously would have been considered out of reach. As noted by 
Rai (2016), evaluation strategies for topic modelling include the reference to expert opinion, as well as 
quantitative approaches, such as the comparison of models estimated using varied parameters. Howev-
er, modelling the contents of document collections is a challenging task and remains an area of active 
research in natural language processing and computer science literature. The “unreasonable effective-
ness” (Halevy et al., 2009) of current models representing large document collections continues to be a 
challenge regarding the question on how to use these models in social-sciences and information sys-
tems research. In research concerned with testing hypothesis on the basis of theory, it is of critical 
importance to be able to convince readers that the models actually represent large document collec-
tions accurately, in order to establish the trustworthiness of conclusions based upon the models

(Lincoln and Guba, 1985). In this paper, we investigate how researchers across different disciplines 
deal with this problem by conducting a structured review of literature in the top outlets of business 
related literature, on the basis of which we categorize different strategies to address this challenge. The 
paper is structured as follows: In section 2, the concept of topic modelling is introduced before a brief 
introduction to the relation between topic modelling methodology and (meta) theoretical considera-
tions is given, based on which we discuss some of the results of the review. In section 3, the research 
design of this study is developed and presented. Section 4 presents and discusses the results of the 
review, while section 5 summarized this research.

Topic Models 
The aim of topic modelling is to determine structures in underlying document collections. Initially, 
topic models were developed as an information retrieval tool, intended to make browsing large docu-
ment collections easier (Salton et al., 1975). In example, topic models can be used to browse collec-
tions of scientific journals according to the subject of articles, without relying on metadata (Blei and 
Lafferty, 2009a). The first widely used model in this class was Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA), 
which as this review shows is still a popular option (Croft and Harper, 1979; Dumais et al., 1988). 
LSA extracts the underlying topics from a term-document matrix by applying singular value decom-
position (SVD), which results in mathematically orthogonal topics. While this assumption of orthogo-
nality contradicts human intuition about topics, topic models are essentially a data compression tech-
nique and this approach leads to the maximization of topic variance on a compressed representation of 
the document collection like how principal component analysis (PCA) does when used to reduce the 
number of features in a regression problem, which many researchers may be more familiar with. This 
assumption of topics’ mutual exclusiveness is softened by probabilistic LSA (pLSA), which models 
topics as word distributions (Hofmann, 1999), leading to a notion of topics more in line with human 
intuition. After all, we would not assume most topics to be completely distinct from one another. This 
model type is extended upon by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which differs from pLSA by im-
posing Dirichlet distributed priors to its word to topic and topic to document distributions (Blei et al., 
2003).

Again, this is more in line with the human notion of topics, as it leads to sparse topic assignments to 
documents due to the sparse nature of the Dirichlet distribution. What this means is that not each doc-
ument is a mixture of all topics in a model, but few topics are disproportionally more important for a 
document than others. A more detailed description of the intuition underlying this model type can be 
found in Blei (2012). This increased resemblance of human intuition does not necessarily mean that 
the more modern approaches outperform their precursors. In example, Bergamaschi and Po (2014) 
implement a plot-based movie recommender system and find that LSA outperforms LDA in their ex-
ample. Since these methods became available, they have also been applied in (M)IS research. In recent 
years, this use has also arrived in top-tier outlets within the discipline (Kulkarni et al., 2014; Larsen 
and Bing, 2016; Sidorova et al., 2008). Superficially, it seems that M(IS) is not making use of the 
newer model types and their advantages regarding their closeness to human intuition, but determining 
whether this is the case requires a closer look and is one of the objectives of the following review. 
2.1 
Meta theoretical Foundations of Topic Modelling Research 
When analyzing approaches to automated text analysis, such as topic mining, taking a step back to 
look at the (meta) theoretical foundation of such approaches can help in the analysis of their use. 
Ignatow (2015) provides an overview of the theoretical foundations of digital text analysis and argues 
that the meta theoretical foundations of such methods have not been sufficiently established and that 
applied social research using them often lacks adequate theories of language supporting the use of the 
method. According to Ignatow (2015), this lack of theoretical foundation stems from the unique posi-
tioning of automated text analysis between the natural and social sciences and weakens its relative 
positioning in comparison to exegetical methods and other inductive qualitative approaches. In princi-
ple, there are three possible meta theoretical foundations of text mining research resulting in three 
types of research designs. First, realist designs use models of text in a positivist framework to develop 
testable theories. See Elder-Vass (2014) for an extensive discussion of different variants of this ap-
proach. Second, constructivist designs use models of text to augment exegetical methods for qualita-
tive text analysis, such as Grounded Theory (Lai and To, 2015). Third, mixed methods research de-
signs (Venkatesh et al., 2016). Such studies often have comparably rigorous meta theoretical under-
pinnings because they are not conducted within the “safety” of either positivist or constructivist refer-
ence frames. While the IS, like many disciplines, traditionally focused on research designs build upon 
positivist mindsets, recently both qualitative (Bagozzi, 2011; Gregory, 1993; Mingers, 1995) and 
mixed methods research designs have become a common sight in the discipline (Ågerfalk, 2013; 
Venkatesh et al., 2013).

Research Design 
As described, the goal of this analysis is to provide insight into the available methods for topic mining, 
and how these methods are applied both in (M)IS and other managerial disciplines. Ngai et al. (2011) 
present a similar analysis for the applications of data mining techniques within the domain of financial 
fraud detection and structure their review into three distinct research design phases, which represent a 
suitable research design for the case at hand. Thus, a comparable three-stage design is chosen for this 
study. In the first stage, the research goal is defined and the analysis is scoped. In the second phase, 
the research-methodology is outlined. In the third phase, we describe how the study is conducted on 
this basis. Figure 1 shows this process. 
3.1 
Phase 1: Identify a Research Goal 
By determining the area of research, formulating the goal of the study, and defining the scope of the 
research, the studies relation to the wider research landscape is determined. In this research, the area of 
research is given by the search for available methodology for the training and evaluation of topic mod-
els, as well as their application in (M)IS and other managerial sciences. The goal of this study is to 
identify methodological opportunities for future studies and to examine how prior research has used

the available methodology. To strengthen the focus of the analysis, this goal is formalized to the fol-
lowing three research questions: 
RQ1 (Methodological pervasiveness): 
How widespread is the usage of topic models in the manage-
ment literature and for what purposes are these models used therein? 
RQ2 (Validation methodology):
How do researchers address the problem of establishing trust into 
the results of their analysis when using topic models to analyze large document collections? 
RQ3 (Interdisciplinary differences):
How does the usage of topic models differ between M(IS) and 
other managerial disciplines? 
The scope of the review is presented by an initial search within all journals included in the Financial 
Times 50 (FT50) ranking, which represents major outlets across numerous management-related fields. 
Further outlets are accepted into the study if they are deemed relevant regarding the aims of the study 
and are discovered by the structured literature review described in the next section. In order to formal-
ize this relevance criterion, the following relevance definition is used throughout this research: Re-
search is considered relevant for the scope of this study, if it falls into one of the four categories out-
lined in Table 1. 
3.2 
Phase 2: Research Methodology 
Our goal in this phase is to arrive at a formalized abstraction of the conducted research process. This 
serves two purposes. First, the resulting design helps when conducting the study by splitting the re-
search process into individual work units. Second, it helps readers to assess the quality and rigor of a 
study by providing a clear indication on how the study was conducted. In the case at hand, the first 
task during this phase is given by the identification of a suitable approach to the identification of lit-
erature using the relevance criterion stated in phase 1, resulting in the question what ways of literature 
exploration have been identified by methodological literature regarding literature reviews. Due to the 
continuous growth of the IS discipline, and the need for junior researchers to gain an overview of ex-
tant research, as well as the increasing difficulty to remain knowledgeable for senior researchers 
(Templier and Paré, 2015), a growing body of work regarding the methodology of literature reviews 
has evolved. Webster and Watson (2002) may be considered the starting point of this methodological 
discussion within IS. Since, Greenhalgh et al. (2005), Sylvester et al. (2013), Rowe (2014), and Boell 
and Cecez-Kecmanovic (2015) are only a small sample of this diverse toolset of methodological ap-
proaches towards literature based research. 
Webster and Watson (2002) are perhaps the most notable example of guidelines to performing a struc-
tured literature search in the IS literature. They propose to divide the search for literature into three

steps. Figure 1 (phase 2) provides an overview of this approach. First, a set of outlets is identified in 
which to search for relevant articles. Second, the references of these articles are examined to identify 
prior work (backward search). Third, the results of the two prior search phases are used to perform a 
search for articles citing them (forward search). As noted above, the relevant outlets for the first phase 
have already been identified as the journals included in the FT50. To search for relevant articles in the 
online databases listing the journals, a search string needs to be determined, which covers a broad 
spectrum of work related to topic modelling. The following string is used and was determined by iter-
ating between including more search terms and removing those, which produce non-relevant results: 
“Topic Mining” OR “Topic Model*” OR “Topic Distribution” OR “Hierarchical Dirichlet Pro-
cess” OR “Multinomial Asymmetric Hierarchical Analysis” OR “Latent Dirichlet Allocation” 
OR “Latent Semantic Indexing” OR “Latent Semantic Analysis” OR Mallet OR Gensim. 
As shown, the string contains several relevant variants of “Topic*”, where the star denotes the appro-
priate 
any
search wildcard for each database. Furthermore, different topic modelling techniques are 
included, as well as MALLET (McCallum, 2002) and Gensim (Rehurek and Sojka, 2010), which rep-
resent two popular implementations of topic models. These two are included because, as opposed to 
most other topic modelling software, they do not include topic modelling in their name. As the result 
of the literature search showed, most papers can be identified using either “Topic Mining” or “Topic 
Model*”. The search string is used to search for titles, abstracts, keywords, as well as the full text of 
papers. Initially, a longer search string was used, which also included abbreviations where applicable, 
such as LDA in addition to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, however the results of searches including the 
abbreviated terms do not provide more relevant results and instead clutter the search results with other 
meanings for the abbreviations, which are not related to topic modelling. Regarding the reviews’ scope 
in time, no assumptions were made during the initial search, but results indicate that no relevant con-
tent exists before 1978. Of course, arguably, text pre-processing literature precedes this year but this 
literature is not specific to topic modelling as a research method. The database search using this search 
string resulted in 108 results (1
st
order document set, Figure 1 phase 2). These documents were conse-
quently assessed using the criteria outlined in Table 1, resulting in 23 2
nd
order documents. On this 
basis, the backward search resulted in 86 additional papers, increasing the 3
rd
order document set to 
109 candidates. The forward search added another 44 papers, resulting in 153 documents. At this state, 
due to the large number of documents in the analysis, we conducted another relevance check and 8 
documents were removed. The remaining 145 documents were assigned to the four relevance catego-
ries outlined in Table 1, resulting in 33 “Applied IS” papers, 29 “Applied Non-IS” papers, along with 
24 implementations and 59 methodological contributions. Figure 1 (phase 3) provides an overview of 
this categorization into methodological research, implementations, and applied research papers stem-
ming from M(IS) or other managerial disciplines. The analytic part of this research is based on this 
final set of documents. 
3.3 
Phase 3: Analysis 
Methodological work:
First, the methodological works are reviewed, to arrive at an overview of the 
available methodology, which can be used by applied studies. To this end, the main methodological 
contribution of each paper is identified by examining each paper in the sample and summarizing its 
main contribution. Based on the sum of these contributions, the typology shown in Figure 2 is devel-
oped, which considers six archetypes of contribution. It should be noted that this is not a formal typol-
ogy or taxonomy, in which the characteristics of each paper would be mutually exclusive from one 
another (Nickerson et al., 2013). Of course, a paper can contribute in more than one way regarding 
these categories. For methodological papers, a 
model type
contribution is given by the introduction of 
a new topic model, which may be done by using an entirely new approach (Blei et al., 2003), augment-
ing existing approaches (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), or changing what is being modelled (Chang and 
Chien, 2009). 
Computational or mathematical
works included in the sample concern algorithms or 
data structures of special importance to topic modelling.

Figure 2: 
Assessment categories for methodological and applied contributions. The set of ap-
plied categories is identical for IS and other managerial literature. Methodological 
contributions are assessed using a separate but partially overlapping set of catego-
ries. 
Purely statistical work, such as numeric optimization techniques, are not included in this review be-
cause, typically, they are not inherently interesting for applied work (although, of course, they are of 
prime importance to enable it). 
Introductory 
papers provide a methodological overview, or give rec-
ommendations for the use of a specific model type. Often, these papers are domain specific. 
Compara-
tive 
papers assess multiple model types, to determine which model is most suitable for a specific do-
main or document type.
Utility
papers help researchers by providing guidance apart from modelling 
itself. In example, Mei et al. (2007) develop a method for automated topic-label generation. 
Model 
validation
is concerned with assessing topic model quality and often develops or compares metrics for 
this task. Finally, a research 
domain
is identified for each paper. The list of discovered methodological 
papers is presented in Appendix A. 
Implementations: 
If methodological papers make their method publicly available or applied papers 
mention the used implementation, this is added as a separate reference category. Each implementation 
is checked regarding its public availability. An implementation is considered public if it is usable (li-
cense not considered) and a download is available. Also, since many implementations are software 
libraries and not stand-alone programs, the programming language used for each implementation is 
noted. The list of discovered implementations is presented in Table 2. 
Applied work:
Likewise, applied papers identified as relevant to the review are assessed. This is done 
by a two-pass procedure. First, like the treatment of methodological papers, each applied paper is as-
sessed regarding its 
main contribution 
(not in figure)
.
These main contributions are consequently di-
vided into 
contribution types
. Second, the papers are assessed regarding their use of topic models. 
Again, the 
model type
used in a paper is determined. 
Model use
describes to what end the topic model 
is used in the paper. For example, if it is used to inspect topics or if the topics are used in a regression 
model. Consequently, 
model validation
(how the model is validated) and 
model presentation
(how the 
model is presented to readers) are derived by examining each paper in more detail. Finally, a 
domain
is coded for each applied paper. As shown, the model type, model validation, and domain criteria are 
shared between the two paper categories, while the other criteria are distinct for each paper type. The 
list of discovered applied papers is presented in Appendices B and C.

Figure 3: 
Annual distribution of contributions grouped by applied (M)IS and other applied 
managerial contributions, as well as methodological contributions. As shown, in re-
cent years applied contributions have begun to outpace methodological works. 
important to keep in mind that recent methodological work is less likely to be discovered by the back-
ward- and forward search mechanism applied in this review. Nonetheless, this still shows the growing 
relevance of topic modelling methodology for both (M)IS and other managerial disciplines.
Methods 
(Appendix A):
As shown in the result tables and Figure 3, topic modelling methodology has become a 
vibrant research subject. Starting with LSA (Dumais et al., 1988) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003), which 
represent the two most common model types used in applied papers, 25 model types are identified in 
this review, many of which focus on extensions of the two archetypes. Notably, despite beginning the 
literature review with the FT50 journal selection as a starting point, many methodological contribu-
tions stemming from the IS domain were identified. Thus, IS seems to have been established as a ref-
erence discipline for researchers looking for methodological guidance in the use of topic models. As 
can be expected, computer science (CS) and statistics present the two other most important methodo-
logical disciplines for topic modelling.
Implementations (Table 2): 
As noted, implementations of the 
methodological contributions included in the review are reported separately if they are available, to 
highlight methods readily available for use. Unfortunately, while most methodological contributions 
explain the statistical approach to their work, publicly available implementations remain the exception. 
BleiLab (2016) provide an example of enabling others to benefit from methodological work and re-
lease implementations and working examples when possible. When comparing, the citation counts of 
papers with released implementations to those without, it is obvious that this approach pays off. Ac-
cessibility remains a major problem (Ramage et al., 2009). All publicly available implementations 
identified in this review are either programming libraries or command line applications. In the interest 
of making topic models as usable as other statistical techniques, implementations with graphical user 
interfaces are needed. 
Applied research papers: 
Table 3 provides a condensed overview of the re-
sults regarding applied research contributions, and contrasts M(IS) with other managerial disciplines. 
Appendices B and C report the full results for these categories in more detail, such as brief descrip-
tions for each contribution. As shown, papers applying topic modelling are dominated by the two 
‘basic’ model types LDA and LSA. When comparing IS to other domains, LSA is favored over LDA, 
while this relation is reversed elsewhere. Also, IS research included twice as many discussion and 
review articles when compared to other managerial disciplines, with 30% of IS articles being reviews 
and 27% being discussion pieces. Also, while 69% of non-IS articles use topic models for content 
analysis, only 12% of IS articles do so. In IS research, 36% percent of papers actively validate a mod-
el, while 59% of non-IS articles do so. Thus, regarding RQ2, we find that while many applied research 
papers make use of the topic model validation techniques proposed by methodological contributions, 
many researchers who use the topic model as a part of regression models abstain from a dedicated 
validation of the topic model.

One reason for the omission of a dedicated validation may be presented by the argument that if a topic 
model produces topics which are useful as variables in the context of statistical analysis, this itself 
validates the model for the purposes of these studies. However, the presentation of the topic model in 
such cases should be especially careful, to establish trustworthiness of the presented analysis. Howev-
er, the lack of implementations of such model types in software intended for the use by social scien-
tists remains a major hurdle for such work. 53% of all applied articles stem from the IS domain, fol-
lowed by accounting research with 10%, while general management and marketing are tied at 8% 
each. 39% of all applied papers use their topic model as a tool for content analysis.
Models are mostly 
used as a variable augmenting existing regression models, or to gain a general sense of topics included 
in text collections.

This type of article is much more common in other managerial disciplines, but IS research using the 
methodology to this end still exists. The second most common applied paper type is presented by re-
view articles, which review research domains (Moqri et al., 2015; Sidorova and Isik, 2010) or journals 
(Cohen Priva and Austerweil, 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Overall, the review indicates a diverse re-
search landscape using topic modelling as a content analysis tool, as well as many research papers 
using it to review entire disciplines or outlets. Regarding their use of topic models some of the discov-
ered contributions distinguish themselves and can serve as examples providing interesting ways to 
describe the usage of a model in an applied paper or integrating topic models in an analysis in another 
interesting way, which sets them apart from papers that ‘end’ after a topic model has been estimated. 
First, Bao and Datta (2014), who investigate risk types in corporate risk disclosures, highlight topic 
models’ capability to simultaneously discover and quantify categories in a document collection, cou-
pled with an extensive model evaluation, which enables readers to assess the reliability of the present-
ed approach. Their evaluation includes both quantitative measures for model fit, comparisons to alter-
native topic models, as well as presentations of the chosen approach using graphs and word-clouds. 
Second, Paul and Girju (2009), who compare research domains using topic models, show how topic 
similarity between different models can be used to compare different document collections, and sup-
port their arguments using a mix of reporting the words included in their estimated topics and graphs 
showing the evolution of topic similarity over time. As these examples show, how a model is dis-
played in a contribution is crucial to establishing trust in presented results. Going one step beyond the 
idea of presentation, Ramage et al. (2009) argue that readers should be able to explore models for 
themselves. Mützel (2015), a sociologist, discusses the lack of student method training in topic model-
ling, and data processing in general, as another challenge hindering the integration of the method in 
non-technical domains but notes that non-technical fields can draw on a vast experience regarding the 
study of meaning, which can support the automated analysis of large data sets, raising the question of 
the 
theoretical foundations of topic modelling
:
Using topic models for the purposes of advancing 
theory has been one of the uses of this model type early on (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) but remains 
the exception when surveying the applied literature. As discussed, accessibility may present one major 
cause for this. Another is given by the lack of theoretical foundations of topic modelling, which makes 
it more challenging to establish trust in results based upon its use. While few studies explicitly state 
their (meta) theoretical foundations, for studies classified as 
content analysis
a positivist underpinning 
aiming at the empirical validation of established theory is often implicitly clear. On the other hand, 
constructivist foundations or mixed methods approaches to the analysis of topic models remain largely 
unexplored. However, similarities and differences between topic modelling and human coding have 
been discussed (Quinn et al., 2010). Also, many studies use topic labels coded from the top words of 
topics as a tool to present their results. Yet, this is usually done for presentation only and not using 
qualitative methodology, which may be suitable for this purpose. Since qualitative researchers have 
developed rigorous coding techniques, this methodology can support quantitative topic modelling 
creating opportunities for collaboration. Thus, the combination of qualitative methodology and topic 
modelling remains an interesting opportunity for future research. Evans and Aceves (2016) survey text 
mining methodology and provide recommendations on how it can be used as a tool for theory genera-
tion in the social theory. Wagner-Pacifici et al. (2015) discuss similar issues with a focus on using big 
data to access knowledge about social phenomena. Ignatow (2015) remains the only article discovered 
in the review in which the theoretical foundations of topic modelling are discussed. However, these 
articles do not discuss topic models in particular. As shown, (M)IS has established itself as a reference 
discipline for other managerial fields regarding topic modelling methodology. The exploration of the 
theoretical foundations of the use and interpretation of topic models, as well as their capabilities re-
garding the generation and testing of social-, economic- and systems theory present an opportunity to 
strengthen this referential role of IS.

Conclusion 
In this review, we surveyed the topic modelling literature regarding the methodological possibilities 
and uses thereof in applied research papers. To this end, we formalize our research design and conduct 
a structured literature review, resulting in a sample of topic modelling methodology and applied re-
search papers in IS and other managerial disciplines. Also, we provide an overview of available im-
plementations of topic modelling approaches. Our results indicate that while, in recent years, topic 
modelling has become a tool used across many disciplines and is especially prevalent in IS research, 
most researchers use “vanilla” LSA or LDA, instead of more specialized modelling approaches. A 
likely reason for this focus on two approaches is given by the lack of publicly available implementa-
tions for many methods. However, some researchers have had great success with making their imple-
mentations available (BleiLab, 2016). More such “open-access methodology” is needed to advance the 
use of topic modelling methodology in IS and other domains, especially regarding model validation, 
which many toolkits for topic modelling do not yet address as a priority and the resulting lack of 
methodological accessibility remains a problem (Ramage et al., 2009). 
Looking at the non-IS research landscape, there is a need for modelling tools which are suited to the 
needs of researchers who do not use command line interfaces or software libraries, as there are no 
graphical user interfaces for most available implementations. A key factor in the quality of topic mod-
elling based research is given by the presentation of the model in a paper. As discussed, looking be-
yond the boundaries of individual disciplines can help to identify successful solutions to this task. 
Also, the (meta) theoretical foundations of topic modelling remain to be established to make it easier 
to integrate the methodology in studies aimed at validating or expanding theory in the social and man-
agerial sciences. One promising avenue for the creation of this theoretical foundation is presented by 
mixed methods, aiming at combining the advantages of modelling large document collections with 
qualitative approaches to content analysis. In conclusion, topic modelling has become a useful tool for 
many researchers, but specialized models and the development of suitable implementations for applied 
researchers remain largely unsolved problems offering perspectives for future research.

Applied papers in other managerial disciplines (non-IS). Results indicate a strong focus on the use of topics models as a tool for content 
analysis, which often involves using the topic to document assignments as variables in regression models. The temporal distribution of 
the discovered contributions within this category indicate a rapid increase in the use of topic modelling methods. While there are sev-
eral tutorials and methodological advice papers within these fields, there is still room for future research regarding a broader spectrum 
of model use and topic model validation. While most studies within these fields use very extensive validation techniques for other statis-
tical methods, topic model validation has not yet been adopted to the same degree. Likewise, most studies either use LSA or LDA, while 
there may still be many use cases for derivatives of these methods.

Applied research papers in Information Systems (IS). As shown, IS researchers have, so far, mainly used topic models for reviewing 
purposes in several contexts. Like researchers in other managerial disciplines, they focus on LSA and LDA for their studies. In compar-
ison, more IS papers discuss the use of topic modelling methodology, while using the model as part of another analysis is less common. 
As 
was 
observed 
in 
other 
domains, 
the 
usage 
of 
topic 
models 
has 
recently 
spiked 
within 
the 
discipline.
