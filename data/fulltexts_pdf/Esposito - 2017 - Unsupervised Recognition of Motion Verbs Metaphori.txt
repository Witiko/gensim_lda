CHAPTER 1
Introduction
The time is October 10, 2013.
The venue the James S. Brady Press Brieﬁng
Room,
a small theatre in the West Wing of the White House where U.S.
Press Brieﬁngs usually take place. The topic at hand is internal politics and
more precisely the debt-ceiling crisis aﬀecting the United States of America
(from here on U.S.).
The White House Press Secretary at the time of Barack H. Obama’s ﬁrst
term presidency is Jay Carney. Discussing with press corps of the
extortion
strategies
1
adopted by congressional Republicans threatening “a govern-
ment shutdown unless their demands were met”
2
,
a very signiﬁcant ex-
change emerges between Mr.
Carney and the journalists, as shown below:
Press Corps
:
You’re saying he
3
won’t negotiate.
You’re saying he’ll
sign a clean extension of the debt ceiling, but he is not going to ne-
gotiate on the other stuﬀ until the shutdown is over?
1
Republican member
party Mitchell
McConnel
ﬁrst
declared the debt-ceiling
ﬁght
as
“a
hostage
that’s
worth ransoming.
And it
focuses
the
Congress
on something that
must
be done” (from the Washington Monthly webpage at
http://washingtonmonthly.com/2011/08/03/mitch-mcconnell-hostage-taker/)

Introduction
Press Corps
:
Yes? Yes?
Mr.
Carney
:
Yes,
the President will
not pay a ransom for [inter-
rupted]
Press Corps
:
Yes, that’s all.
Yes.
Press Corps
:
It’s the “pay a ransom” [interrupted]
Press Corps
:
You see it as a ransom, but it’s a metaphor that doesn’t
serve our purposes of ﬁguring out what’s actually going on.
Press Corps
:
We just don’t want to write it wrong.
Mr.
Carney
:
But you guys are just too literal then, right?
Press Corps
:
We just want to accurately report what’s happening.
Mr. Carney
: The closing of the American mind and failure to appre-
ciate metaphor and simile.
The excerpt from the press brieﬁng shows how deep the relationship
between politics and metaphors is.
Actually, drawing upon the words of
the press corps, political rhetoric is so imbued with metaphors that it can
become an obstacle for the full comprehension of one’s thought. It no coin-
cidence that Thompson (1996) titled his work stating that “[p]olitics with-
out metaphors is like a ﬁsh without water”.
In the realm of political discourse, metaphors cannot be considered just
as another simple trope but they play an important role in the communi-
cation strategies employed by the speaker.
The question-answer exchange
between Mr.
Carney and the journalists is a prime example since bringing
to light the strategic use of language made by the Press Secretary.
In fact,
aware of the narrative advanced by congressional Republicans on the issue
of the debt-ceiling, he ﬁnds the way to use it as leverage.
Indeed, employ-
ing the strategic metaphor of “pay a ransom”, the President and his whole
administration immediately join the
good guys
team, acting at the same time
as victims but also remarking that they are ones in command.
In this way,
the demands asked to be met by congressional Republicans become an act
of extortion, the
ransom
that Obama’s administration is not willing to pay.
It can only be considered as fascinating (and at the same time troubling)
3
how metaphors can become powerful tools of manipulation in the hands
(or perhaps better to say words) of political ﬁgures.
Thus, being able to process and fully comprehend metaphors when it
comes to political discourse represents an essential skill not only for us hu-
mans but also for machines.
Indeed, as the amount of political data keeps
on growing day by day due to the endless digital evolution, the develop-
ment of systems being able to handle and detect metaphors in these large
collection of texts becomes of foremost importance.
However, as also highlighted by the press corps, this task is not as triv-
ial as one might be led to think, even for humans. Metaphors can be indeed
obscure to one’s interpretation, metaphors can be misleading, metaphors
sometimes cannot be even perceived at all as such.
How can a machine
understand that in Mr.
Carney’s utterance the ransom that the President
is not going to pay is not actually a
real and true
ransom?
Let us just be the machine for a few seconds.
If we were just looking at
the utterance itself, it would be impossible for us to detect the presence of
this trope.
Indeed, the syntactic structure is incomplete as we do not even
know what the President is not paying the ransom for (even if there were a
pronoun, we should ﬁrst resolve its reference). Furthermore, metaphors do
not all show the same linguistic pattern.
In this case, our reading is either
entirely metaphorical or not metaphorical.
We begin to understand what
the real meaning of Carney’s words is only looking at the larger context,
namely the preceding questions coming from the press corps. Even so, it is
not easy at all to understand the reference of the
absent
prepositional object
in the metaphorical expression, not to mention the correct understanding
of terms such as
shutdown
in this context.
Last but not least, if we machine
wanted to interpret the metaphorical expression, we should ﬁrst know that
humans talk of reaching an agreement in terms of criminal negotiation.
Thus,
in order to successfully (or at least in most of the cases) detect
(and interpret) a metaphor, a machine should be primarily provided with
two things:
a grammatical
and cultural
knowledge.
In the ﬁeld of the
computational modelling of metaphors,
several studies have focused on
4

Introduction
this aspect,
endowing the machine with knowledge coming from hand-
crafted resources.
However precious and accurate they are,
not only do
these repositories require eﬀort and time for building but they are often
limited to a handful of languages.
Thus, in order to overcome this limita-
tion, the development of metaphor processing systems that do not rely on
hand-coded knowledge is arising as a very important issue.
1.1
About this thesis
This thesis deals with the problem of the automatic recognition of the novel
metaphorical or literal use of lexical items in dialogical naturally-occurring
continuous texts without the recourse to hand-coded knowledge.
The fo-
cus is on the political genre since the building of an English for Special Pur-
poses (henceforth ESP) corpus collecting the White House Press Brieﬁngs
4
represents one of the ﬁrst objectives of the present research.
Furthermore,
it is important to highlight that metaphors play an important role in politi-
cal discourse at both a linguistic and cognitive-pragmatic level. The lexical
items under investigation are represented by the verbs of motion identiﬁed
by Levin (1993), due to their role in the communication strategies deployed
in public and political discourse.
The problem of metaphor recognition is
addressed employing unsupervised techniques which theoretical founda-
tions primarily lie in the
Distributional Hypothesis
theory developed by Har-
ris (1954), namely word embeddings and topic models.
Systems are tested
on continuous data from real-world situations, although speciﬁcally con-
strained by the genre of the corpus used. The metaphor processing models
developed in this thesis adopt two diﬀerent approaches,
deﬁned as
local
and
global
.
The ﬁrst one leverages syntactic knowledge for the recognition
of metaphoricity.
The second one drifts away from the use of the syntactic
structure as feature of the system hence only using the information inferred
from the discourse context.
This method leads to the following research

As the excerpt shown in the previous section.

About this thesis
5
questions:
RQ1
Can we move towards a
syntax-agnostic
approach when dealing with
the automatic recognition of metaphors employing broadly-based
distributional semantics techniques such as word embeddings and
topic models? More precisely:
–
How does the use of these two unsupervised techniques per-
form on lexical items when no syntactic information is taken
into consideration?
–
Does the information coming from topic modelling improve the
performance of the system when syntactic information is taken
into account?
RQ2
On the basis of Dunn (2013b)’ claim that the linguistic structure of
an utterance inﬂuences its metaphorical reading leading to a binary
distinction between
saturated
5
and
unsaturated
6
utterances:
–
Can it be observed any inﬂuence of the particular linguistic
structure in the ﬁnal performance of the metaphor recognition
system?
–
Does the
global
approach help improve the performance of the
algorithm in the detection of
metaphors in saturated utter-
ances?
RQ3
Avoiding the recourse to any task-speciﬁc hand-coded knowledge
and labelled data, does the joint use of word embeddings and topic
modelling compare favourably with metaphor processing systems
based on unsupervised approaches present in literature?
The thesis is structured as follows.
5
Either an entirely metaphorical or non-metaphorical reading is possible.
6
Only a metaphorical reading is possible.

Theoretical background
2.2
Talking of metaphors
Metaphors are all
around us.
Well,
ﬁguratively speaking of
course.
Metaphors have been around us for centuries.
Perhaps,
it is more safely
to say since the dawn of human race.
Some have indeed suggested that
cave paintings could be actually considered as the ﬁrst signs of non-verbal
metaphors (Lichtman,
2013,
p.356).
However,
as argued by Lakoﬀ and
Johnson (1980, p.180), it is in the Ancient Greek that the power of metaphor
begins to be discussed and widely acknowledged. Evidence of this is found
in the words of Aristotle,
who used to sing its praises in his
Poetics
and
Rhetoric
stating that “[i]t is a great thing, indeed, to make proper use of the
poetic forms, ...But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor
(
Poetics
1459a)” since “ordinary words convey only what we know already;
it is from metaphor that we can best get hold of something fresh (
Rhetoric
1410b)” (Lakoﬀ and Johnson, 1980, p.180).
Metaphors permeate our lives, shape the way we perceive our reality
and the way we act on it.
They help us convey complex messages rein-
vigorating the meaning of ordinary words in a quest of clarity,
while at
the same time adorning and enriching our communication.
Metaphors
are also powerful devices of communication:
they allow us to move be-
tween diﬀerent domains,
from a local to a more general perspective,
re-
shaping the message to be subsequently delivered to the wider audience.
Metaphors are fascinating tools of reasoning. They are indeed associations
between concepts that at ﬁrst sight may look distant and unrelated.
The
creative process behind the metaphor is not conﬁned only to its production,
in the “corresponding use of strange words [resulting] in a barbarism (Po-
etics 1458a)” (Barnes, 2014, p.2333). Receiving and interpreting a metaphor
is a process that indeed stimulates our reasoning and generates a number
of analogical associations which are only limited by our linguistic and cul-
tural knowledge and by the way we interpret the reality we live in.
Thus, it comes as no surprise that metaphors are so entrenched in our
daily use of language, in every and each aspect of it.
They are found in the
2.2.
Talking of metaphors
13
newscasts we watch, in the songs we listen to, in the newspaper we read,
in the conversations we overhear.
They indeed pervade every text genre,
be them written or spoken.
Their meaning is sometimes so embedded in
our personal lexicon that we humans seem barely able to recognise them as
such. However, taking a closer look, it is still possible to detect and observe
the linguistic creativity push that originally
ignited
them.
Over the years, the
power
of metaphor and their ubiquity across texts
have inevitably drawn the attention of scholars from a variety of research
ﬁelds,
ranging from linguistics to philosophy,
from politics to cognitive
neuroscience.
In this regard,
the 1980s represented a turning point for
the academic studies since being the cradle of landmark works that would
deeply impact the future lines of research.
In particular, the contribution
given by Lakoﬀ and Johnson (1980) forged the path of the Natural Lan-
guage Processing (henceforth NLP) research on metaphor which extends
until today.
Veale et
al.
(2016,
p.3) legitimately point
out that
the study of this
rhetorical trope still “remains a niche area in the computational study of
lanaguage”.
Indeed, being the metaphor a very complex phenomenon in
language involving the analysis of many and diﬀerent linguistic layers –
e.g.
syntax,
semantics,
co-reference,
inference,
just to name a few – NLP
community has tended to postpone any work on its investigation, focusing
instead on
problems
of “more practical and immediate [linguistic] interest”
(Veale et al., 2016, p.3).
However,
this
niche
area has been widely investigated during recent
years, producing a thriving literature in which not only have diﬀerent and
varied approaches to the study of metaphors been proposed, but signiﬁ-
cant step towards its computational identiﬁcation and interpretation have
been observed.
Furthermore, the greater availability of data, the building
of
ad-hoc
resources and the growing computational and linguistic interests
are among those factors that have boosted the research on this direction.
Indeed, leveraging the state-of-the-art technologies developed in literature
and cognitive theories and intuitions pursued by researchers, the compu-
14
Chapter 2.
Theoretical background
tational modelling of metaphors can represent an important integration
in many NLP-oriented applications and an advancement for a more com-
prehensive understanding of this fascinating and complex language phe-
nomenon.
Furthermore,
innumerable are the beneﬁts that this research
could bring to the study of more qualitative aspects.
One need only think
of those ﬁelds focusing on the impact and on the eﬀects triggered by the
use of metaphors in real-world communication (e.g.
sociology and politi-
cal science just to name a few).
2.3
Conceptual Metaphor Theory
As previously said in Section 2.2, the main source of inﬂuence and inspira-
tion in NLP research on metaphor resides in the extensively investigation
of this rhetorical trope carried out by Lakoﬀ and Johnson (1980).
In fact,
if browsing through the literature of the last three decades,
it can be ob-
served that much of the work on the computational modelling of metaphor
proposed so far have in common the same theoretical foundation, namely
Lakoﬀ and Johnson’s landmark work.
In
Metaphors We Live By
, the authors presented a view on metaphor that
would deﬁnitely change the panorama of the research ﬁeld for the years
to come.
Their perspective is known across scholars and laymen alike as
Conceptual Metaphor Theory (henceforth CMT).
The keystone of Lakoﬀ and Johnson’s work lies in the claim that our
conceptual system – namely the way in which we both think and act – is
“fundamentally metaphorical in nature” (Lakoﬀ and Johnson, 1980,
p.4).
According to the authors,
metaphors are indeed not just a phenomenon
exclusively belonging to the realm of language,
“just a matter of words”
(Lakoﬀ and Johnson, 1980, p.4), but rather pervasive in our thoughts and
in our actions.
What this means it is that the metaphorical
power
that we
can observe unleashing on the surface of the linguistic evidence resides
primarily in our conceptual system.
Quoting authors’ words, “[t]he con-
cept is metaphorically structured, the activity is metaphorically structured,
2.3.
Conceptual Metaphor Theory
15
and, consequently, the language is metaphorically structured” (Lakoﬀ and
Johnson, 1980,
p.5).
Since all starting from the concept,
the linguistic re-
alisations of metaphors as we know them “are possible precisely because
there are metaphors in a person’s conceptual system” (Lakoﬀ and Johnson,
1980, p.6).
Thus, language becomes a source of evidence for the deﬁnition
of this system.
The importance of this claim is further reinforced by the
role played by these concepts in our daily lives, as our conceptual system
structures the way we interact with the world surrounding us, ergo deﬁn-
ing (the vision of) the reality we live in.
In order to explain the way the conceptual metaphor takes place and
how it inevitably, and often unconsciously, shapes our actions, Lakoﬀ and
Johnson discuss the existence of the conceptual metaphor
argument is war
that seems common to many societies nowadays,
especially the western
ones.
Let us look at the following examples drawn from diﬀerent text gen-
res that support authors’ claim:
(i)
Mary demolished John’s argument with her newly found evidence
(from Dunn (2013b, p.38))
(ii)

search engine
2
)
(iv)
Trump can be impulsive.
But his war with the press is strategic.
(from Vox.com
3
)
The point made by Lakoﬀ and Johnson is that not only do we talk about
arguments using a
war
terminology, but we actually live our arguments as

Theoretical background
a
war
.
We use
evidence
as weapons for ﬁnal victory.
We see our arguing
counterpart as an opponent to be
battled
.
Every step is carefully planned
with the necessary
strategy
to gain ground.
And we seem very interested
in understanding and exploring the right procedure to win an argument
(or at least, a great part of the websurfers). Furthermore, the four examples
can be considered as reﬂections of real-life situations (only (i) is carefully
designed for proving a point but it is not hard to be found in a conversation)
proving that this conceptual metaphor “is one that we [still] live by in this
culture [...]
[structuring] the actions we perform in arguing” (Lakoﬀ and
Johnson, 1980, p.4).
What can be observed from these examples is that the metaphor does
not lie only in its surface realisation,
but rather “in our very concept of
argument” (Lakoﬀ and Johnson, 1980, p.5). According to the authors, “the
essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing
in terms of another”.
It is the systematic association between the concept
and the way we talk about it that allows us to comprehend one aspect of
it in terms of another.
Indeed,
the metaphorical structuring of concepts
is always only partial.
Conversely, we would confuse one thing with the
other, in this way withdrawing from the use of the metaphor (to say that
someone is a
chicken
makes only reference to some aspects that are believed
to be proper of the animal known as chicken).
Indeed,
“[t]he metaphor
highlights certain features while suppressing others” (Lakoﬀ and Johnson,
1980, p.141).
Thus,
at the light of what said so far,
when we can deﬁne metaphor
as cognitive mechanism that arises when two distant and seemingly un-
related concepts are partially understood in terms of the other.
In fact,
“[t]he primary function of metaphor is to provide a partial understanding
of one kind of experience in terms of another kind of experience” (Lakoﬀ
and Johnson,
1980,
p.154).
This systematic correspondence is explained
by Lakoﬀ and Johnson as a mapping between two domains of experience,
the
source
and the
target
.
More precisely, we infer patterns from the source
domain to conceptualise the target domain.
2.3.
Conceptual Metaphor Theory
17
The root of the conceptual metaphor structure described by Lakoﬀ and
Johnson can be traced back the
interaction view
, and particularly indebted to
the work of Black (1962).
The main contribution to the CMT can be proba-
bly summed up using the metaphor
man is a wolf
discussed in Black (1954)
where the author states “[t]he eﬀect,
then,
of (metaphorically) calling a
man a“wolf” is to evoke the wolf-system of related commonplaces.
[...]
Any human traits that can without undue strain be talked about in “wolf-
language” will be rendered prominent, and any that cannot will be pushed
into the background. The wolf-metaphor suppresses some details, empha-
sises others – in short,
organizes our view of man”.
(Black, 1954,
p.288).
However, it has been the work of Lakoﬀ and Johnson to have emphasised
the cognitive aspect of the production and realisation of the metaphor, in-
ﬂuencing and pushing forward the computational work in the ﬁeld of NLP
so far. Let us look at the following examples for a more comprehensive un-
derstanding of the phenomenon:

“Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings,
but they cannot touch the foundation of America.
These acts shatter
steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.” (from G.W.
Bush’s speech to the nation from PBS Newshour
7
)
The examples above show how we systematically experience the tar-
get domain of
politics
:
we infer some of the most relevant features of the
source domain of
buildings
and we project them onto the target domain.
In fact, we draw from the
buildings
lexicon words and expressions “to talk
about corresponding concepts in metaphorically deﬁned domain” (Lakoﬀ
and Johnson,
1980,
p.52),
in this case the political one.

ile political and cultural situation as a building on the verge of collapse.
We perceive our political future like a path that needs to be laid down.
We worry about the external attacks as menaces threatening to disrupt the
foundations of the country-building we belong to.
These systematic associations conﬁrm the existence of the conceptual
metaphor
politics is building
, which is reﬂected in our linguistic expressions.
Indeed, quoting Shutova (2015, p.580), “[the] conceptual metaphor mani-
fests itself in language in the form of
linguistic metaphor
,
or metaphorical
expression”. Following Shutova’s categorisation, the metaphorical expres-
sion can be realised as:
•
lexical
metaphor, namely a single word extension (as in (1), (2));
•
multi-word
metaphorical expression (as in (4) and, more in general,
in the case of idioms);
•
extended
metaphor,
where the rhetorical
trope spans over the dis-
course under analysis (as in (3) and (4)).
In the present dissertation,
when speaking of metaphors,
I will
re-
fer from now on to their
surface
linguistic manifestations in natural lan-
guage – i.e. the metaphorical expressions we can bump into text or speech.

The linguistic structure in metaphors

More precisely,
the focus of analysis for the investigation and computa-
tional identiﬁcation will be represented by their single word extensions,
namely the
lexical
metaphors.
The reasons motivating this choice are to be
explained in next sections.
2.4
The linguistic structure in metaphors
We humans seem to be able to recognise a metaphor without too much
eﬀort when bumping into one.
Quoting Dunn (2010,
p.54),
“[t]here is
clearly an intuition possessed by native speakers that some utterances are
metaphoric and others non-metaphoric. The vast literature on metaphor is
enough to show that this intuition exists”.
Studies have shown a fair rate
of agreement between annotators (Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Shutova et al.,
2013; Beigman Klebanov et al., 2014) so far, as it often happens to disagree
on the metaphoric
charge
of some linguistic expressions.
As pointed out by Dunn, metaphors are not all equal. Some utterances
may in fact be regarded as more metaphoric than others as their degree
of metaphoricity varies.
“These more metaphoric expressions are more
marked,
in the sense that they stand out more clearly from “literal” ex-
pressions” (Dunn, 2010, p.54). The major claim of (Dunn, 2013b) is that the
linguistic structure of an utterance inﬂuences and helps in modelling the
metaphoric meaning of the utterance itself.
More precisely,
the linguis-
tic properties of an utterance actually inﬂuence its direct and consistent
metaphorical interpretation or make the metaphorical reading dependent
on the it context of appearance.
The author is indeed interested in under-
standing if metaphors do have a meaning – as exempliﬁed by Black and by
the approaches of CMT – or if metaphors behave as exempliﬁed by David-
son (Davidson, 1978), namely they do only have a literal meaning, which
can be considered as absurd or false.
Nonetheless, however important the
debate about the meaning of the metaphor is not only for theoretical is-
sues but also for practical purposes,
I will not engage with it discussing
this aspect of Dunn’s research since beyond the scope of the present work.
20
Chapter 2.
Theoretical background
The interest
of
this dissertation lies indeed in the criteria the au-
thor presents for categorising the variation of metaphoricity in utterances.
What he means for degree of metaphoricity can be explained with the ex-
ample (5) repeated from the utterance (1) in Section 2.3 and drawn from
Dunn (2013b).
(5)
Mary demolished John’s argument with her newly found evidence.
In (5)
we can observe that
the utterance can only be identiﬁed as
metaphoric.
Quoting Dunn (2013b,
pp.39-40),
supposing “natural
lan-
guage utterances have a semantic structure that consists,
in part,
of case
role organization connecting an event with its arguments (Fillmore, 1967),
and if we assume that the arguments of an event must meet certain se-
lectional
restrictions (Katz and Fodor 1963)”,
the utterance in (5) “con-
tain mismatched arguments”.
Indeed,
not physical objects such as
argu-
ments
cannot be demolished,
moreover using a not physical instrument
such as an
evidence
.
Ergo,
the meaning of the utterance cannot be any-
thing but metaphoric.
However,
what Dunn wants to point out is that
some utterances presents a semantic structure that makes them result more
metaphorical than others.
Let us consider the following examples:
(6)
Mary demolished John’s stronghold with her newly found evidence.
(7)
Mary demolished John’s stronghold with her newly found weapon.
Although there is not a clear dividing line between what can be con-
sidered metaphoric and non-metaphoric, the point being made by Dunn
is that metaphoricity varies continuously. In (6) the patient role is changed
to
stronghold
,
increasing its degree of metaphoricity.
In (7),
also the in-
strument role is changed to
newly found weapon
, with the utterance being
2.4.
The linguistic structure in metaphors
21
more metaphorical than the others
8
.
Having a closer look at (7), it can be
observed that it is not possible to state if the utterance is metaphorical or
not.
From our experience,
we may tend towards a metaphorical reading
since it is hard to ﬁnd some common people owning both a stronghold
and a weapon.
But, what if Mary and John make reference to two monar-
chs? What if John and Mary are just two kids playing in the playground?
Thus,
the utterance (7) can only be entirely metaphoric or entirely non-
metaphoric, until we do not fully comprehend the content of its surround-
ing context.
To account for the above-described variation in metaphoricity,
Dunn
divides metaphoric utterances in two categories based on their internal lin-
guistic structure, deﬁning them as
unsaturated
and
saturated
.
“The degree
of saturation depends on how much the utterance is ﬁlled with metaphor-
ical material” (Dunn, 2013b, p.39):
•
Unsaturated utterances
:
contain elements from both target
and
source domains;
•
Saturated utterances
: contain elements only from the target domain.
Let us examine the utterance (8) drawn from the ﬁrst sentence of (4) in
2.3:
(8)
“Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings,
but they cannot touch the foundation of America.”
As it can be observed, (8) is an unsaturated utterance.
Indeed, the sen-
tence contains elements from both the source and target domains. A phys-
ical event such as the
terrorist attacks
cannot physically
touch
the
founda-
tion
of a political-established entity.
As the case role ﬁllers do not meet
8
From intuition, I agree with Dunn on certain utterances being more metaphorical
than others.
However,
I am not discussing here the gradient distinction provided by
the author.
22
Chapter 2.
Theoretical background
the selectional restrictions, there is a “mismatch or divergence between the
elements of the utterance” (Dunn, 2013b, p.40).
Most importantly, unsat-
urated utterances like (8) have only one reading, the metaphoric one.
In-
deed, they can be identiﬁed as such just observing their linguistic structure
without having to analyse the surrounding context.
On the contrary,
the metaphoric or non-metaphoric reading of satu-
rated utterances depends on the wider linguistic context.
Dunn stresses
that this ambiguity does not lie in the lexical items involved in the utter-
ance but rather only on their use in a particular context.
The example (9)
repeated from Section 2.3 makes the case for us.
(9)
“We build bridges not walls”
We recognise the metaphorical meaning of (9) because we know that
the person uttering it was Hillary Clinton during one of her rally for the
presidential campaign. We know indeed what the term
walls
refers to – i.e.
the well-known wall wanted by Trump to mark the border between U.S.
and Mexico – hence leading us to infer that both
bridges
and
walls
do not
make reference to physical objects (furthermore, she is not talking of any
speciﬁc object since not using any determiner).
Thus, (9) is categorised as
a saturated utterance, ﬁlled only with elements from the target domain (in
this case,
buildings
).
However,
supposing we do not share this common
knowledge,
the entirely non-metaphoric or entirely metaphoric meaning
of (9) can be ascertained only looking at its surrounding linguistic context.
Until then, (9) may have also been uttered by a contractor or an engineer,
as far as we know.
On the basis of his corpus study research, Dunn provides the
causes
of
saturation for an utterance, as outlined in the following lines:
•
Referential ambiguity
:
when it is not possible to resolve the refer-
ence of pronouns.
2.4.
The linguistic structure in metaphors
23
•
Lexical ambiguity
: the lexical item is too
general
too provide the nec-
essary information for the detection of the metaphor.
•
Unspecified arguments
:
according to Dunn, this is the most persis-
tent cause of saturation.
A missing argument is the cause of the am-
biguity.
•
Background knowledge
:
background or world knowledge is given
for granted making it impossible to detect the metaphorical expres-
sion without it.
Furthermore,
Dunn adds that both unsaturated and saturated utter-
ances may display a diﬀerent degree of metaphoricity, hence causing a not
stable interpretation of the metaphor-in-use. Nonetheless, he does not pro-
vide a clear-cut deﬁnition of this gradient measure.
Utterances having a
high metaphoricity show in some cases “a highly metaphoric cross-domain
mapping” (Dunn, 2013b, p.40).
The measure of degree lies in the choice of
the lexicon used as shown in (6) and (7).
It is important to highlight here
that both high and low metaphoricity utterances have only a metaphoric
meaning
9
.
On the basis of
the results of
his corpus study on 500 verbs from
four general domains (
physical
,
mental
,
social
,
abstract
), Dunn (2013b, p.46)
claims that a mutual dependence emerges between cognitive mappings
and the presence of certain linguistic properties of utterances.
His work
is cognitive-oriented,
providing evidence for an enhancement of the de-
scriptive coverage of metaphors that could make a joint use of diﬀerent ap-
proaches to meaning in language.
Nonetheless, what is of interest here is
the attention paid to the linguistic structure in the exploration of metaphor-
ical meaning, providing important contributions for both a qualitative and
computational perspective.
In particular, starting from the claim that not
all metaphors are equal,
the delineation of the two unsaturated and sat-
urated categories represents in this dissertation an important tool for the

I do not delve into the interpretation aspects of the degree of metaphoricity since
beyond the scope of the present work.

2.5
The Proximization Theory
It comes as no surprise that metaphor has been drawing the attention of
many scholars coming from a variety of research ﬁelds.
This fascinating
phenomenon resulting from the
collaboration
between mind and language
represents indeed a major device of communication.
It is probably in pol-
itics that the metaphor arises not simply as a ﬁgure of speech but rather as
a powerful rhetorical tool to shape the political mind (Lakoﬀ, 2008) of the
listener.
From a more practical point of view,
Beer and De Landtsheer (2004,
p.24) state that these tropes are used by politicians “as tools of persuasive
communication, to bridge gaps and build identiﬁcation between strangers;
to frame issues; to create, maintain, or dissolve political coalitions; to gen-
erate votes and win elections”.
It is no coincidence then that Thompson
(1996) provocatively states that “politics without metaphor is like a ﬁsh
without water”.
If conﬁrmations were needed,
recent studies in linguis-
tic and political science (Musolf, 2000; Lakoﬀ, 2008; Lakoﬀ and Wehling,
2012) have indeed suggested that “the use of a particular metaphor often
guides the speakers’
argumentation strategy throughout a piece of dis-
course,
as well as participants’ behaviour in a dialogue” (Shutova,
2015,
p.585).
This claim seems to be validated by the
proximization
theory (Cap,
2013),
a methodological tool recently introduced in cognitive-pragmatics
research for the analysis of strategic regularities in political and public dis-
courses.
Proximization is deﬁned by Piotr Cap as “a discursive strategy of
presenting physically and temporally distant
events and states of
af-
fairs (including “distant” adversarial ideologies) as increasingly and neg-
atively consequential to the speaker and her addressee”.
Developed as
2.5.
The Proximization Theory
25
a cognitive-linguistic,
pragmatic and critical
discourse analytic concept,
proximization makes reference to how speakers present,
and most im-
portantly,
leverage the threat of distant entities as “gradually encroach-
ing upon the speaker-addressee territory (both physical and ideological)”
(Cap, 2014, p.17), in order to
legitimise
their decisions and actions, disguis-
ing them behind the need of neutralising the upcoming negative impact.
The origin of the term
proximization
must be traced back to the work
of Chilton (2004),
which was the one to ﬁrst introduce the verbal forms
proximize
and
proximizing
used to describe the act of “bringing [conceptu-
ally] closer” something or somebody (Cap, 2014, p.17).
It was Cap (2005)
to have ﬁrst employed the nominal term
proximization
referring to “ [an]
organized,
strategic deployment of cognitive-pragmatic construals of/in
(originally,
political) discourse” (Cap,
2013,
p.5).
Proximization was in-
deed initially investigated in the political and public domain, with a major
focus on the interventionist rhetoric.
It was later extended to various do-
mains,
as it started to become integrating part of theoretical frameworks
in several studies (Hart, 2010; Chovanec, 2010; Kopytowska, 2010; Cienki
et al., 2010; Dunmire, 2011).
The formalisation of proximization as an integrated theory has been
proposed in Cap (2013), primarily motivated by the work of Paul Chilton.
The root
of
the theory can be indeed found in two main aspects of
Chilton’s research:
the ﬁrst one is represented by the attempt to provide
a cognitive-linguistic model
of conceptualisation in (political) discourse
(Chilton, 2004).
Chilton’s major claim is that in any discourse people
po-
sition
other entities in their
world
in a relation that can be expressed via
three axes – i.e.
space, time and modality.
The second one is the attempt
to use the three-dimensional space and vector geometry to investigate lex-
ical and grammatical constructions, for the sake of a cognitive scientiﬁc at-
tempt (Chilton, 2005).
The proximization theory indeed follows the origi-
nal concept delineated in Chilton (2004) and Cap (2006) accounting for “the
symbolic construal of relation between entities within the Discourse Space
(DS)” (Cap,
2013,
p.17).
The deictic center – represented by the speaker
26
Chapter 2.
Theoretical background
themselves realised using pronouns and names of address – is the origin
of the three dimensions.
Ergo, the entities of the DS are the
Self
– i.e.
the
speaker – and the distant entities described by them.
The strategic narrative depicts the distant and peripheral entities re-
ferred to as ODCs (outside-deictic-center) as posing a threat since con-
ceptualised as to be crossing the DS in order to invade the IDCs’
space
(inside-deictic-center).
The IDCs are in turn represented not only by the
speaker themselves but also by all the people the threat is posed to.
The
threat itself operates on three aspects according to the Spatial-Temporal-
Axiological (STA) analytical model.
In fact,
proximization acknowledges
and leverages the “primacy of spatial cognition” (Cap, 2014, p.18) in lan-
guage and in discourse construction.
The
spatial
aspect is
a forced construal
in which the ODCs are
physically
invading IDCs’ territory.
The
temporal
as-
pect is
a forced construal
where there is a “symbolic “compression” of the
time axis” (Cap, 2013, p.85), since conﬂict and threat are described as up-
coming and historic.
The axiological proximization depicts an ideological
clash between the inner values of the IDCs and the ODCs’ antagonistic val-
ues.
All together, these three aspects of proximization “contribute to the
continual narrowing of the symbolic distance between the entities/values
in the Discourse Space and their negative impact on the speaker and her ad-
dressee” (Cap, 2014, p.17).
Let us consider the following examples drawn
from Cap (2013) for the sake of clarity:
(10)
The danger is clear:
using chemical,
biological or,
one day,
nuclear
weapons,
obtained with the help of Iraq,
the terrorists could fulﬁll
their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands
of innocent people in our country, or any other. [...] The United States
and other nations did nothing to deserve or invite this threat.
But
we will do everything to defeat it.
Instead of drifting along toward
tragedy, we will set a course toward safety.
Before the day of horror
can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will be removed. (G.
W. Bush, March 17, 2003)

The Proximization Theory
27
(11)
Now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and
suﬀering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank.
(G. W. Bush, April 24, 2003)
(12)
The stakes in that region could not be higher.
If the Middle East re-
mains a place where freedom and democracy do not ﬂourish, it will
remain a place of stagnation and anger and violence for export. And
as we saw in the ruins of the towers,
no distance on the map will
protect our lives and way of life.
(G. W. Bush, November 19, 2003)
The three examples are all
extracted from G.W.
Bush’s war-rhetoric
speeches.
In (10), Cap describes a mechanism of spatial proximization in
act.
Using lexical items and phrases such as
innocent people
,
our country
,
other nations
,
United States
, President Bush seems to establish a new shared
geopolitical identity creating in this way an IDC territory that is not only
menaced but also likely to be potentially invaded by the ODCs,
namely
the terrorists.
In (11), the key lexical item is
now
, making the utterance an
example of temporal proximization.
Now
is suggested by Cap as “the mo-
ment to start or decide on starting the pre-emptive action [...] informed by
events from the past frame” (Cap,
2013,
p.91).
(12) shows how ideology
can be used as a tool for the legimitisation of actions.
The clash is here
between the
freedom and democracy
values of the IDCs threatened by the
ODCs bleak values and postures, further empowered by the analogy with
the past events of 9/11.
As it can be observed, the ODCs shifting towards
the IDCs territory – be it spatial, temporal or ideological – is often enacted
by resorting to metaphors and ﬁgurative language (e.g.
drifting along to-
ward tragedy
,
bring great chaos
,
ruins of the towers
), which helps strengthen
the message conveyed by the speaker.
The interest raised by this theory in the present dissertation does not
lie only in the conﬁrmation that politics is highly
indebted
to metaphors, as
previously described.
Firstly, this framework has been proved to be appli-
cable to wide areas of the public discourse (cf.
Chapter 4 for the nature of
28
Chapter 2.
Theoretical background
the data to be used in this work).
Secondly, the contribution provided by
this analytical model does not rest on a conceptual level, but also shows the
role played by lexico-grammatical items.
Indeed, in a study performed on
a corpus of US presidential speeches and remarks on the US anti-terrorist
policies and actions in Cap (2013),
the author categorises the key lexico-
grammatical items of the spatial proximization framework based on a key-
ness frequency threshold.
What of interest here is the role played by the
verbs (and verb phrases) of motion and directionality construed as mark-
ers of movement of ODCs towards the deictic center, and also being used
as metaphors in political discourse.
The unit of analysis of metaphorical investigation in the present thesis
will be indeed represented by the verbs of motion.
In fact,
acquiring a
deictic status intrinsic in the motion they encode, these verbs may represent
the
vehicles
leveraged by the speaker to portray the threat posed by the
foreign
DS entities – i.e.
their addressees – on the IDCs territory, be them
political adversaries or foreign enemies, be them symbolic or not.
2.6
The lexical units under investigation:
the verbs of motion
In 1993 a pioneering work on the classiﬁcation of over 3,000 English verbs
was published by the University of Chicago.
To this day,
the rich refer-
ence study of Levin (1993) is indeed a reference point for scholars and re-
searchers from NLP and linguistics communities alike.
Levin starts from the claim that “there is more to lexical knowledge
than knowledge of idiosyncratic word-speciﬁc properties [...] easily illus-
trated with respect to verbs” (Levin,
1993,
p.1).
Speaker’s awareness of
their properties seems indeed not to be limited to the
classic
lexical knowl-
edge represented by subcategorisation frames,
namely the number and
syntactic types of arguments with which the verb (in this case) co-occurs
with.
Instead, “knowing the meaning of a verb can be a key to knowing
2.6.
The lexical units under investigation:
the verbs of motion
29
its behaviour” (Levin, 1993, p.5).
What Levin means is that the syntactic
behaviour of the verb can be actually predicted from its meaning, hence ex-
pecting that verbs belonging to a particular class also share similar aspects
of meaning.
In a nutshell, a verb is classiﬁed in a particular class based on
the correlation that exists between its speciﬁc types of syntactic behaviour
– i.e. the verb alternation, namely the realisations of its argument structure
– and the semantics of the verb itself.
As pointed out by Lenci (2008), verbs classes are indeed identiﬁed us-
ing a distributional analysis where the context features are the diﬀerent
alternations in which verbs are found.
Indeed, according to Levin, the in-
vestigation of diathesis alternations is the revealing factor for distinction
and grouping of semantic coherent class of verbs.
“Thus diathesis alter-
nations can be used to provide a probe into the elements entering into the
lexical representation of word meaning [...] bringing out unexpected simi-
larities and diﬀerences between verbs.” (Levin, 1993, p.14-15). In fact, each
class is subsequently investigated to
draw out
the common semantic prop-
erties that characterise the verbs belonging to the class itself.
As observed
by Lenci (2008, p.15), “similarity in distribution is taken to be an overt con-
sequence of some deep semantic property that explains it”.
By way of ex-
ample,
the author indicates how verbs of motion – a class often cited as
large and important – are not homogeneous as it was usually thought, but
they could actually be split in more than just one main class.
Levin and
Hovav (1992) prove indeed that this class could be divided at least into
two subclasses, the one of
inherently directed motion
and the one of
manner
of motion
.
Thus, what Levin wants to stress is that “the important theoret-
ical construct is the notion of meaning component, not the notion of verb
class” (Levin, 1993, p.17).
As it will be described and motivated in Chapter 5, in the present the-
sis the whole category of verbs of motion is initially taken into account
for its metaphorical investigation.
Thus, based on the work carried out by
Levin, the selection of the lexical items to be analysed is realised here by
extracting
the terms belonging to the cluster n°51,
indeed describing the
30

verbs falling into the

section.
The class is further divided into
diﬀerent subclasses, each one describing a semantic coherent little cluster
isolating particular meaning components.

Distributional Semantics: an overview
In the last three decades a fundamental question has arisen in the computa-
tional linguistics community:
how can machine model meaning? Luckily
for us (and for machines), in the 20
th
century scholars belonging to a wide
spectrum of research ﬁelds – ranging from linguistics to the cognitive psy-
chology – have been asking themselves how we humans process and model
meaning.
The theoretical frameworks originated from this quest – still far
from being considered accomplished – represented the pivotal contribu-
tion to the study of meaning from a computational perspective that led to
what it is considered today as “the most systematic and extensive appli-
cation of distributional method” (Bruni et al., 2014, p.1), i.e.
the Distribu-
tional Semantic Models (henceforth,
DSMs).
Broadly speaking,
it can be
said that DSMs represent the meaning of a word by looking at the context
in which it appears.
This deﬁnition has often been used as a gentle intro-
duction to help get a grasp on the theory behind this models of meaning
representation.
Nonetheless,
a more thorough explanation is due to the
interested reader.
3.2.1
The theory behind the models:
the Distributional Hy-
pothesis
The theoretical foundation of any distributional semantic model is to be
found in the assumption that a certain degree of semantic similarity be-
tween linguistic items can be determined by looking at their linguistic dis-
tributions, i.e. the words surrounding each linguistic item. To put it diﬀer-
ently,
“there is a correlation between distributional similarity and mean-
ing similarity, which allows us to utilize the former in order to estimate the
3.2.
Distributional Semantics:
an overview
33
latte” (Sahlgren,
2008,
p.34).
This assumption is known as
Distributional
Hypothesis
(henceforth DH) and it can be more formally deﬁned quoting
Lenci (2008, p.3):
“The degree of semantic similarity between two linguistic expressions A
and B is a function of the similarity of the linguistic contexts in which A
and B can appear.”
Thus, the lexical meaning of a word (or at least part of it) depends on its
distributional properties, ergo words that share similar contexts will tend
to share also similar meanings.
The rise of the DH is usually connected to the work of Zellig Harris,
and more precisely to his distributional methodology which contribution
is not only reﬂected in today DMSs’ fortune but most importantly in its
immeasurable support to the development of linguistics as a scientiﬁc re-
search ﬁeld. Although the study of meaning has a long tradition that can be
dated back to the philosophical work of Wittgenstein (1973) claiming that
the meaning of a word actually lies in their use, it has been Harris to have
laid the foundations for an analysis of meaning based on “ﬁrm method-
ological bases” (Lenci, 2008, p.4), along the lines of the post-bloomﬁeldian
American structuralism tradition.
Stating that
“[...]
diﬀerence of
meaning correlates with diﬀerence
in distribution” (Harris,
1970,
p.786),
Harris claims that
the meaning
of a word resides in its purely linguistic realisation.
Indeed,
“the lin-
guistic meaning is inherently diﬀerential,
and not referentia” (Sahlgren,
2008,
p.36).
Linguistics as a science should deal with the internal struc-
ture of the language itself and not be looking at extralinguistic aspects
(although accepting that
“extralinguistic factors do inﬂuence linguistic
events” (Sahlgren,
2006,
p.23)).
Thus,
according to Harris’
view of the
distributional methodology,
the
explanans
for semantic similarity is to be
found in the similarity in the linguistic distribution.
This means that if we
observe that two linguistic items share the same linguistic environment,
we may deduce that they also have a related meaning.

Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
According to Harris,
the distributional approach is the procedure to
“typologize the whole of language” (Sahlgren, 2008, p.35). As observed by
Lenci (2008) and Sahlgren (2008), even if Harris does not take into account
meaning as an explanation for linguistic phenomena (just like Bloomﬁeld
did),
he views the possible investigation of meaning in its linguistic con-
ﬁguration only possible via a distributional analysis.
A note of caution is in order about the notion of semantic similarity
in the DH.
The investigation of word meaning on the basis of the distri-
butional analysis brings out paradigmatic similarities between linguistic
items occurring in the same contexts.
This notion of semantic similarity
must be considered as a very broad one as it does not reveal the speciﬁc
semantic relation between the linguistic items under analysis (synonymy,
antonymy, hyperonymy and so forth), but it rather encompasses all of them
in the ﬁnal representation.
As pointed out by Lenci (2008,
p.14),
under this paradigm “the DH
only assumes the existence of a correlation between semantic content and
linguistic distributions” in order to “get at a better understanding of the
semantic behavior of lexical items”.
The distributional methodology as a
discovery procedure cannot identify the speciﬁc semantic relation because
it is not what it aims at doing.
As stressed by Sahlgren (2006, p.24), “[t]he
distributional methodology only discovers diﬀerences (or similarities) in
meaning [...] If we want to claim that we extract and represent some partic-
ular type of semantic relation in the word-space model
1
, we need to modify
either the distributional hypothesis or the geometric metaphor, or perhaps
even both”.
Lenci (2008, p.14) deﬁnes the quantitative discovery procedure as pro-
posed by Harris as a
weak
DH, where the distributional properties are not
indicative of words semantic properties at a cognitive level but rather se-
mantics is taken “as a kind of “latent varibale” which is responsible for
the linguistic distributions that we observe”.
The Italian scholar comes up

The
word-space
model will be discussed in the following sections, although using
a diﬀerent terminology for its deﬁnition.
3.2.
Distributional Semantics:

35
with this deﬁnition to distinguish this approach from the
strong
version
as shown by Miller and Charles (1991),
where the DH is interpreted un-
der a cognitive paradigm since “a word’s contextual representation is not
itself a linguistic context,
but is an abstract cognitive structure that accu-
mulates from encounters with the word in various (linguistic) contexts”
(Miller and Charles, 1991, p.5).
Ergo, under this assumption the distribu-
tional discovery procedure does not dwell only in the realm of linguistics
but it also becomes the basis for the cognitive hypothesis, an
explanans
of
the formation of meaning in a cognitive perspective.
Under the generativism era,
the structural approach to the investiga-
tion of meaning was temporarily dismissed by the scientiﬁc community.
However,
the rise of corpus-linguistics from the ’80s on,
backed by the
well-known Firthian quote “You shall know a word from the company it
keeps” (Firth, 1957, p.11), and the statistical approach to the study of lan-
guage represented a proof of the success of the distributional analysis as
a pivotal methodology for the investigation of lexical meaning.
Indeed, as
corpora became available and widespread across the linguistics commu-
nity, the introduction of corpus-based statistical techniques for the study
of words distribution across wide collections of texts marked the success
of the empirical methodology applied to the study of word meaning.
3.2.2
Distributional Semantic Models
During the last three decades,
distributional semantics has played a key
role in the computational linguistics community, pushing forward the re-
search for meaning understanding and representation.
The ﬁrst models
were introduced in the early 1990s, when the probabilistic revolution took
root and machine learning started to become an established asset across
NLP.
DSMs, also known as
word-space
(Schütze, 1993; Sahlgren, 2006),
vector-
space
(Turney and Pantel, 2010) or
semantic-space
(Padó and Lapata, 2007)
models,
represent word meaning in geometrical spaces where the close-
ness between two words indicates their meaning similarity.
More speciﬁ-
36
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
cally, DMSs can be deﬁned as unsupervised computational methods that
“[...]
represent salient aspects of lexical meaning” (Lenci,
2010,
p.57) as
high-dimensional vectors built out of a corpus-based statistical analysis
of words co-occurrence across text(s).
Every vector stores the informa-
tion about the co-occurrence of the term under analysis with its context
and its dimensions equal the size of the corpus vocabulary.
The degree of
semantic relatedness between the two linguistic items is measured as the
geometric distance between their respective vectors.
In the next paragraph sections, the main features in the building of a
DMS are discussed, since representing the foundational structural frame-
work for the unsupervised approaches to be discussed in the next sections.
The detailed description of a typical DSM in Section 3.2.2.1 is indebted to
the works of Sahlgren (2006) and Evert (2010a).
3.2.2.1
Building and features of a DSM
As the number of DMSs have been thriving in literature so far,
the un-
derlying main idea has been shown to reside in the scientiﬁc approach to
linguistics described by the DH.
Even though diﬀering in the choice of
a speciﬁc parameter (context features,
association measures,
geometrical
distance and so forth) according to the
philosophical
approach and to the
task at hand, the building of DSMs shows a common structure behind the
implementation of every model.
A critical role is obviously played by cor-
pora since not only do they represent the repository of the language in use
– ergo inﬂuencing the ﬁnal semantic representation of words – but they
are typically the unique input of a DSM (if not considering the indirect
supervision in the parameters setting).
3.2.2.1.1
DSM as a matrix.
According to Evert (2010a),
a DSM can be
seen as a scaled and/or transformed co-occurrence matrix where each row
represents the distribution of a target term – hence the semantic vector –
and each column represents the context/dimension in which the target

appears.
More formally,
in a
r
×
c
co-occurrence matrix
M
,
the
r
rows represent the target terms while the
c
columns are the features or
dimensions, which characteristics are up to the decision of the researcher.
Let us take as a way of example the following utterance – well-known in
the entertainment world
3
today – to illustrate a toy co-occurrence matrix:
(13)
A Lannister always pays his debts
In this toy example we deﬁne the context as the one word preceding
and following the target term.
Deﬁning
t
as the target term,
its context
are
t
−
1
and
t
+1
:
in this case, it means that the the context of ‘Lannister’
are respectively ‘A’ and ‘always’.
Once tabulated the information for each
term, our toy co-occurrence will look like as in Figure 3.1.

I borrow the term
co-occurrent
from Sahlgren (2006) due to its self-
explanatory meaning.
For each word co-occurring with the target term, a
1 is assigned to it.
The sequence of numbers for each target term is known
as
vector
.
The vector
~v
of the term ‘Lannister’ is in this case the ordered
list (1,0,1,0,0,0).
Thus,
~v
is deﬁned by its
n
components or coordinates
that place and describe the location of the vector in a
n
-dimensional space.

The word

here encompasses a wide range of linguistic items such as tokens,
lemmas, phrases, morphemes and so forth.

Hence, a vector can be formally deﬁned as
~v
= (
x

, x

n
)
where
x
n
is
the
n
th coordinate of the vector.
Sahlgren (2006, p.28)’s deﬁnes this vector
as
context vector
and highlights the importance of this concept for moving
from the distributional data to the representation in the geometrical space.
Going back to the above matrix deﬁnition, our

3.2.2.1.2
Linguistic pre-processing.
The ﬁrst step when handling cor-
pus data is to linguistically process the text.
Tokenisation is typically con-
sidered the minimal requirement but more steps of the NLP pipeline can
be performed (POS-tagging,
lemmatisation,
dependency parsing and so
forth) depending on the ﬁnal aim of the research.
Evert (2010a) points out that the implementation of a NLP pipeline of-
ten helps reduce data sparseness, a typical problem in distributional mod-
els. Indeed, as shown in our toy matrix, the majority of cells present zero as
their entries.
Quoting Sahlgren (2006, p.38) making reference to the
Zipf’s
law
(Zipf, 1949),
“[o]nly a tiny amount of the words in language are dis-
tributionally promiscuous; the vast majority of words only occur in a very
limited number of contexts”.
To address this issue, both linguistic and statistical criteria may come to
the aid in the development of the DSM. Sahlgren (2006, p.38) indicates that
even if POS-tagging ﬁltering removes functional terms and words with lit-
tle semantic meaning (also acting as a shallow means of disambiguation),
the result is “modest at best” as the majority of words belong to open gram-
matical classes.
Evert (2010a) instead suggest that performing lemmatisa-
tion on texts often reduce data sparseness.
3.2.
Distributional Semantics:

39
On the other side, dimensionality reduction via
simple
statistical mea-
sures (ﬁltering of high- and low-frequencies terms) may help increase the
number of words removed resulting in a more signiﬁcant dimensionality
reduction.
However,
the
linguistic
drawback of this procedure is that se-
mantic meaningful terms belonging to open classes tend to be discarded
during the process. More sophisticated statistical measures as feature scal-
ing can be implemented to
handle
the sparseness issue,
as it will be dis-
cussed in the next lines.
3.2.2.1.3
Co-occurrence context.
As previously discussed,
each cell of
our toy matrix records the frequency of
the target
term with the pre-
deﬁned context.
In our toy example, I deﬁne the context as the one word
preceding and following the target
term.
Typically,
the context
of
co-
occurrence it is learnt by skimming through huge corpora and it may vary
from one distributional model to another.
However, in literature two are
the main term-context matrices proposed: the term-context-region and the
term-term matrices.
In the ﬁrst one,
rows represent target terms while columns are the
context-regions – be them documents,
paragraphs,
sentences and so on.
Hence, each cell entry records the frequency of the target term in each in-
dividual context-region.
Let be
c
n
the
n
th context-region, the vector of the
term-context-region matrix can be formally deﬁned as
~v
= (
c
1
, c
2
, ..., c
n
)
,
resulting often in a very sparse matrix.
The deﬁnition of the context-region as wide portion of texts such as
documents is a direct legacy of the information retrieval.
As pointed out
by Sahlgren (2008), one might want to carefully select the context if s/he
is going to study syntagmatic or paradigmatic similarities.
Indeed, in this
case the similarity between vectors constructed in this matrix results in a
syntagmatic relation.
In the term-term matrix, the context is regarded as the words surround-
ing the target term.
Hence, rows are the target terms and the columns are
the word types
w
deﬁning the
n
dimensions of the model.
The vector in

Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
a term-term matrix is formally deﬁned as
~v
= (
w
1
, w
2
, ..., w
n
)
.
This ma-
trix favours the emergence of a paradigmatic relation from the resulting
vectors similarity.
In choosing the context of co-occurrence on which one will be operat-
ing,
Evert (2008,
pp.11–16) describes three main types of context used in
Distributional Semantics:
the surface co-occurrence (terms co-occurring
in a certain distance according to the most classical
Firthian tradition),
textual
co-occurrence (terms co-occurring in the same textual
unit) and
syntactic co-occurrence (terms co-occurring in speciﬁc syntagmatic rela-
tions).
Sahlgren (2006) shows that matrices built according to a paradig-
matic paradigm provide richer data and a more robust statistical founda-
tions.
His claim is also supported by Schütze and Pedersen (1997) stating
that term-term matrices provide more signiﬁcant linguistic results and a
statistical basis.
3.2.2.1.4
Feature scaling.
When using raw frequency in our matrix, the
result is to have skewed data and context words that are not informative
about our target terms.
To deal with this issue, feature scaling can be per-
formed in order to give more relevance to less frequent but more informa-
tive context features.
Due to the scope of the present dissertation,
I only
list here the most common weighting measures employed in literature.
Tf-idf – legacy of the research ﬁeld of information retrieval – has been
used to measure the relevance of a term to a document in a corpus.
Evert
(2005) provides a wide detailed inventory of statistical association mea-
sures diﬀering in the balancing of observed and expected co-occurrence
counts:
Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1990), Local Mutual In-
formation Evert (2005) and Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (Dagan
et al., 1993; Niwa and Nitta, 1994) stand out for having being proved to pro-
vide better results with both term-context-region and term-term matrices.
The use of these measures is fundamental for having more representative
data.

3.2.2.1.5
Dimensionality reduction.
One of the most common issue in
the building of a DSM is indeed handling very large and sparse matrices.
Indeed, Evert (2010b) shows that the Web1T5-Easy term-term matrix built
out of the Google Web 1T 5-gram database contains one trillion cells of
which less than 0.05% presents a nonzero entry.
To address this problem,
the solution is to apply
dimensionality reduction
(also known as
model com-
pression
) to represent high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space.
The statistical
technique known as Singular
Value Decomposition
(henceforth SVD) has been widely applied in literature.
It consists in the
decomposition of the original matrix into several smaller matrices that can
be multiplied to reproduce the original one.
This approach is typically as-
sociated to the well-known work of Landauer and Dumais (1997) where
dimensionality reductions is used to uncover latent dimensions.
Lund and Burgess (1996) performs dimensionality reduction by
fea-
ture selection
, computing the variances for each row and column and keep-
ing only the elements with high variance.
Karlgren and Sahlgren (2001)
present the renowned DSM implementation known as Random Indexing
(RI) that solves the problem of dimensionality reduction directly from the
construction of the co-occurrence matrix.
More precisely,
RI “removes
the need for the huge co-occurrence matrix [...]
[by]
incrementally accu-
mulat[ing]
context vectors,
which can then,
if needed,
be assembled into
a co-occurrence matrix” Sahlgren (2006, p.42).
As Basile et al. (2015, p.39)
point out, “[t]he mathematical insight behind the RI is the projection of a
high-dimensional space on a lower dimensional one using a random ma-
trix”.
3.2.2.1.6
Computing word similarity.
The representation of vectors in
a geometrical space allows to compute proximity between word in math-
ematical terms.
Among the similarity measures proposed in literature so
far, both Euclidean distance and City Block distance (also known as Man-
hattan distance) are considered as special cases of the general Minkwoski
metric.
However,
as Widdows (2004) and Sahlgren (2006) point out,
us-
42
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
ing these measures “frequent words will
end up being
too far
from the
other words” (Sahlgren, 2006,
p.35).
Due also to these reasons,
the most
frequently employed similarity measures across DMSs is the cosine sim-
ilarity measure.
More precisely,
the scalar product of the two vectors is
divided by their norms as in the following formula:
cos
_
sim
(
~x, ~y
) =
x
·
y
|
x
||
y
|
(3.1)
Thus,
if observing the geometrical space,
the similarity between the
two vectors is interpreted by looking at the size of the angle between them.
3.3
Word Embeddings
Although originally developed as an approach to language modelling from
research on neural networks (Bengio et al., 2003), the distributed represen-
tations of words today known as
word embeddings
rest on the same foun-
dational linguistic hypothesis that characterises each DSM: “words which
are similar in meaning occur in similar contexts” (Rubenstein and Goode-
nough, 1965, p.627).
Indeed, just like any DSM, a
neural
word embedding
is the representation of a word as a vector, which can be considered mean-
ingless per se if not applied to a pre-deﬁnite task.
What is the diﬀerence
then in using a DSM or a neural model in the building of such a vector?
The most signiﬁcant and explanatory answer can be found in the words
of Bengio et al. (2003, p.1137):
“[w]e propose to ﬁght the curse of dimen-
sionality by learning a distributed representation for words”.
Indeed, un-
like DSMs’ vector representations which are usually high-dimensional and
sparse (if no dimensionality reduction step is applied), word embeddings
are real-valued, low-dimensional (typically up to hundreds of dimensions,
rarely over a thousand), dense distributed representations (ergo presenting
most of its values as non-zeroes), hence much more eﬃcient under a com-
3.3.
Word Embeddings
43
putational perspective.
Furthermore,
as observed by Baroni et al.
(2014,
p.238),
in this approach “[t]he traditional construction of context vectors
is turned on its head”.
Indeed, while traditional DSMs build their vectors
by ﬁrst collecting and counting the co-occurrences of the target term with
the context words in the pre-set
surrounding
window and then applying
weighting functions,
neural word embeddings models “replac[e] the es-
sentially heuristic stacking of vector transforms in earlier models
5
with a
single, well-deﬁned supervised learning step” (Baroni et al., 2014, p.238) by
predicting one term from its surrounding neighbouring words (this is why
DSMs and word embeddings algorithms respectively are also known as
count
and
predictive models
6
).
Thus, the learning process of the distributed
representations of words is typically performed by making probabilistic
predictions: the target word
w
t
is predicted given the preceding one(s)
w
p
.
In the next section, attention is paid to the speciﬁc two-layer neural net-
work employed in this dissertation for the production of these distributed
representation of words.
3.3.1
Word2Vec
As shown in Section 3.3, word embeddings have been around in NLP for
almost ﬁfteen years so far. Bengio et al. (2003) were among the ﬁrst ones to
experiment and leverage neural networks to learn words distributed repre-
sentations.
The landmark works of Mnih and Hinton (2007) and Collobert
and Weston (2008) undoubtedly provided an important boost to the study
of predictive models for word representations,
with the latter introduc-
ing the main structure of the neural network architecture that would be at
the basis of future proposed in literature.
Nonetheless, it was the work of
Mikolov et al. (2013c,a) that marked the explosion of word embeddings as
a
viral
phenomenon across the NLP community.
Indeed, the release of the

This terminology became widespread among NLP scholars after its use in the
renowned paper of Baroni et al. (2014).
44
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
Word2Vec toolkit
7
by Mikolov prompted several researchers to investigate
the use of word embeddings in diﬀerent NLP tasks
8
.
The huge success is probably to be found in the main diﬀerences with
the previous approaches presented in literature.
Indeed, unlike the neural
network architectures which had been proposed previously, Word2Vec fo-
cuses explicitly on the generation of word embeddings – hence not only as
a by-product – by reducing signiﬁcantly its computational complexity.
In
fact, if compared to popular neural network models, the simple model ar-
chitecture of Word2Vec allows to train high quality vectors even on corpora
of large dimensions in very reasonable times.
Word2Vec toolkit is the eﬃcient implementation of two diﬀerent archi-
tectures for the generation of word embeddings: Contextual Bag-Of-Words
(henceforth CBOW) and the Skip-gram models.
Simplifying the network
structure by removing expensive hidden layers and non-linear functions,
both the architectures represent computationally-eﬀective predictive mod-
els.
The ﬁrst architecture is deﬁned as CBOW since word distributed repre-
sentation is continuous and, being based on a bag-of-words model, word
order does not count.
In the CBOW, the
n
context vectors around the tar-
get word are the input to the model. The sum of the vector representations
of the context vectors is used to predict the target word.
The symmetrical
window to be set is up to the decision of the researcher. Embeddings for the
context and target word are learnt separately.
The probability of the target
term given its context words is computed as a softmax function.
The ob-
jective function is applied to each word in the corpus and embeddings are
updated using gradient-based techniques.
Since two diﬀerent words with
similar contexts will tend to have a similar meaning, the network will learn
similar word vectors for these two diﬀerent words.
Furthermore, in order
to speed up the process of maximising the probabilities for each word in
the corpus, Word2Vec provides two alternatives to the standard computa-

tion via softmax classiﬁer:
the hierarchical softmax and the negative sam-
pling. The hierarchical softmax improves training eﬃciency by decompos-
ing the probability of observing a word into a tree-sequence of probabilities
making the complexity logarithmic. Negative sampling instead maximises
the probability of estimating the correct word by minimising the expected
probability of random words drawn from a noise distribution.
The second architecture implemented in Word2Vec is the skip-gram
model.
The main diﬀerence between the two models lies in the notion of
context construction.
In fact, it can be said that the skip-gram model turns
the CBOW one on its head.
Indeed, instead of predicting a word from its
context, each surrounding word is predicted from its target word.
Hence,
what diﬀers between the two architectures is the target variable since the
skip-gram follows the same topology as of the CBOW.
Let us take as a way of example the famous Shakespeare’s quote in
(14) drawn from his Hamlet to illustrate the diﬀerence in the prediction
between the two models.
(14)
“Madness in great ones must not unwatched go”
Using the CBOW approach,
low capitalising our Claudius’ utterance
and simply deﬁning the context as one word before and after the target
word to be predicted, our dataset would be then look like as in the follow-
ing list:
(15)
[([<padding>,
in],
madness),
([madness,
great],
in),
([in,
ones],
great), ...]
where,
the words in square brackets are the input words – i.e.
the
n
context terms – used to predict the middle target term of the symmetrical
window.
On the contrary, as the skip-gram model inverts the context and
target terms, it uses the current word to predict the
n
words surrounding
it.
Thus, using this architecture, our dataset would now look like as in the
following list:
46
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
(16)
[(madness,
[<padding>,
in]),
(in,
[madness,
great]),
(great,
[in,
ones]), ...]
where, the ﬁrst word in the round brackets is now the input term used
to predict the output context words represented in square brackets.
Using predictive models, Baroni et al. (2014) report an improvement in
results in a series of tasks compared to the count-based models. Indeed, in
their systematic evaluative comparison of count and predictive models the
authors show that the neural network implementation represented by the
optimisation of parameters of the Word2Vec CBOW architecture is able to
beat
an optimised distributional semantic model on the tasks of semantic
relatedness, analogy and synonym detection while not showing a relevant
improvement on selectional preferences and concept categorisation tasks.
The results of their investigation even led the authors to push forward the
research on the
new
wave of word embeddings stating that “the predict
models are so good that [...]
there are very good reasons to switch to the
new architecture” (Baroni et al., 2014, p.245).
Nonetheless,
the attention drawn by word embeddings (and by the
Word2Vec model in particular) lies primarily in the syntactic and semantic
properties that such word vectors have been shown to exhibit.
In fact, as
shown in the landmark work of Mikolov et al. (2013c),
the neural model
automatically encodes linguistic regularities in the vector representations
and semantic relations between them emerge by performing simple alge-
braic operations.
Analogy is probably one of the most interesting and noticeable prop-
erties of these embeddings,
of the kind
a is to be as c is to __
.
As shown
by Mikolov himself
9
, using the embeddings of
king
,
man
and
woman
and
computing simple vector operations it can be observed that the resulting
vector is the one of the word

Furthermore, impressive results in

other (e.g.
the ﬁrst semantic related word of the element-wise addition of
vector(Czech) and vector(currency) returns vector(koruna)) and for named
entities (e.g.

3.3.1.1
The success of word embeddings
Browsing through the scientiﬁc literature produced so far, it is not hard to
bump into studies leveraging the properties of word embeddings for the
enhancement of several NLP tasks.
Systems developed for dealing with Word Sense Disambiguation (from
here on WSD) tasks have widely beneﬁted from the popularisation of these
low-dense vector representations as several studies have shown (Taghipour
and Ng, 2015; Rothe and Schütze, 2015).
Due to the large success,
recently Iacobacci et al.
(2016) have carried
out a study where they propose a comparison of frameworks integrat-
ing diﬀerent kind of embeddings (more precisely the ones generated by
Word2Vec, C&W (Collobert and Weston, 2008) and the
retroﬁtted
approach
(Faruqui et al., 2014)), evaluated on standard WSD tasks against multiple
benchmarks.
Authors show that an accurately designed WSD system tak-
ing advantage of word embeddings provides a signiﬁcant improvement in
results if compared to state-of-the-art WSD system equipped with several
standard features.
In their study, Passos et al. (2014) showed that using a skip-gram model
extended to include information from curated lexicons gathered from sev-
eral resources not only improves the quality of the learnt phrase embed-
dings evaluated on three diﬀerent tasks, but the high-quality word repre-
sentations also play a key role in signiﬁcantly boosting the performance of
their Named Entity Recognition (from now on NER) system compared to
the previous best performing framework using public data (Lin and Wu,
2009).
Unrelated to the enhancement of NLP tasks, Levy and Goldberg (2014)
worked on the implementation of word embeddings that could include
syntactic information.
Instead of taking into account linear contexts,
the
authors generalise the skip-gram model
with negative sampling using
replacing the bag-of-words context
with dependency-based contexts
10
.
10
The main tweak in the context is the collapsing of the prepositional relations into
single arcs.
3.4.
Topic Modelling
49
Compared to
classic
word embeddings,
dependency-based
embeddings pro-
duce diﬀerent kinds of semantic relations similarity, favouring a more
local
context and functional similarity.
The most sound proof of the success of word embeddings and the
popularisation of Word2Vec across the NLP community is probably rep-
resented by GloVe (Global Vectors) (Pennington et al., 2014). Starting from
the claim that the gap between count-based and prediction-based methods
is not as deep as it was thought, the authors developed the GloVe model
to fully leverage the statistical information of global word co-occurrence
counts as the Word2Vec’s skip-gram model “poorly utilize the statistics
of the corpus” (Pennington et al., 2014, p.1532).
Indeed, GloVe makes ex-
plicit the encoding of meaning in the vector space performing the training
on the
no-sparse
global word-word co-occurrence matrix representing the
most valid alternative to Word2Vec’s architectures.
Works on the computational modelling of metaphors involving the use
of word embeddings techniques are to be discussed in Section 3.5.3.1.
3.4
Topic Modelling
As Bruni et al. (2014) point out,
probabilistic topic models have been re-
cently proposed as an alternative implementation of models of distribu-
tional semantics.
Nonetheless, the main diﬀerence between the two mod-
els lies in the representation of the meaning provided:
like DSMs,
topic
models are unsupervised algorithms that can process large amount of data;
unlike DSMs, probabilistic topic models do not represent meaning in a ge-
ometric space model but infer hidden semantic structures in the form of
cluster of words using statistical inference.
Topic models are actually a family of algorithms that allow to analyse
unlabelled large collections of documents in order to discover the
latent
topics which they consist of. They were initially inspired and motivated by
50
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
Latent Semantic Analysis (henceforth LSA)
11
(Landauer and Dumais, 1997)
and by its probabilistic alternative known as Probabilistic Latent Semantic
Analysis (Hoﬀman et al., 2010) (henceforth pLSA
12
).
The prominence in the distributional semantic ﬁelds of LSA resides in
its novel approach to dimensionality reduction of the word-space model
(cf.
Section 3.2.2).
As Sahlgren (2006, p.39) points out, LSA was developed
to deal with the synonymy issues that previous word-space models were
unable to address in the ﬁeld of information retrieval. Indeed, as the model
learns low-dimensional vector representations by grouping together words
co-occurring in similar contexts, it is possible to retrieve documents where
synonym words of the
query-word
appear (ergo not needing the
query-word
to be present in the document).
Presented as an alternative to LSA, pLSA is categorised as a probabilis-
tic variant to the original LSA’s approach
13
. Indeed, instead of using linear
algebra with “a somewhat
ad-hoc
[use]” (Hofmann,
2001,
p.178) of SVD,
pLSA provides instead a solid statistical foundation based on a generative
probabilistic process. The aim of pLSA model is to discover the latent vari-
ables – namely the topics/themes/concepts in each document – associated
with the observed variables, i.e.
the observation of a word occurring in a
particular document.
Each document is ﬁnally represented as mixture of
topics where each word is an expression of its probability given the partic-
ular topic.
In the next section,
the particular topic modelling algorithm imple-
mented in this dissertation for the task of metaphor recognition is de-
scribed.
11
LSA is also known as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) mainly in the ﬁeld of infor-
mation retrieval and the acronyms are often used interchangeably in literature.
Here
I decided to refer to the LSA model as presented by Landauer and Dumais in their
landmark paper.

3.4.1
Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Amongst the algorithms proposed in literature, the most inﬂuential topic
model is probably considered the latent Dirichlet Allocation (henceforth
LDA)(Blei et al., 2003). LDA overcomes the main limitations posed by LSA
and pLSA as both the models “do not embody generative probabilistic pro-
cesses” (Blei and Laﬀerty, 2009, p.1).
Instead, the generative probabilistic
model adopted in LDA allows to perform better generalisations on new
unseen
documents.
The basic intuition behind the approach is that a document consists of
multiple topics. The assumption of LDA is that each word in a document is
associated to a single mixture of topics deﬁned as bag-of-words sequence
(hence not taking into account the order of their context of appearance).
Each word in the topic is in turn associated to the probability of appearing
in the identiﬁed topic.
As Blei (2012, p.79) highlights, what diﬀerentiates
LDA from other similar approaches is that “all the documents in the col-
lection [i.e.
the corpus] share the same set of topics,
but each document
exhibits those topics in diﬀerent proportion”.
In a more intuitive view, given a document included in a collection (be
it a Wikipedia page, an article in a newspaper and similar) LDA automat-
ically discovers the topics
hidden
in the document and represents them as
a cluster of semantically related words.
The LDA process can be summed
up as shown by Blei (2012, p.12). Topics are assumed to be speciﬁed before
data have been generated.
For each document in our collection, words are
generated in two steps:
1.
A distribution over the topics is randomly chosen.
2.
For each word in the document:
a)
A topic is randomly chosen from the distribution over topics of
step 1.
52
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
b)
A word is randomly chosen from the corresponding distribu-
tion over the vocabulary (i.e.
the words in our collection).
A note of caution is in order about the qualitative aspect of the dis-
covered topics as these may not correspond to the actual topics present in
the document itself.
Indeed, in more practical terms, LDA deﬁnes the set
of topics by analysing all the documents in the corpus and represent each
document as a probability list of topics associated to it.
It follows that a
topic may be
activated
by some words in the document that do not actually
semantically
describe it. In this case, a key role is often played by the length
of the document itself as it will be also discussed in Chapter 6.
Thus, LDA can be then deﬁned as a generative probabilistic model that
allows to infer latent topics in a collection of documents.
The topic struc-
ture is the underlying
hidden
variable (Blei,
2012) to be discovered given
the
observed
variables,
i.e.
documents’ items from a ﬁxed vocabulary,
be
them textual or not.
LDA model deﬁnes indeed a joint probability distri-
bution over both observed and hidden variables using it to compute the
conditional distribution of the hidden variables given the observed ones
Blei (2012).
3.4.1.1
The success of topic models
The rise of machine learning, the advantage of not requiring any prior la-
belling data (ergo unsupervised) and their successful application in several
linguistic (but not only) tasks (Liu et al., 2016) has drawn the attention of
NLP scholars and practitioners alike to topic models, with a special atten-
tion to LDA.
Boyd-Graber and Blei (2009) presented and evaluated a
syntactic topic
model
which,
as the name suggests,
captures syntactically and themati-
cally coherent topics. Unlike topic models, in their approach words are not
treated as exchangeable units but are constrained by the syntactic structure
of the tree.
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
53
Ó Séaghdha (2010) applied three topic models related to LDA for the
task of selectional preferences induction and evaluated the corresponding
outputs on a human plausibility judgements dataset.
The author claim
that the topic models perform competitively if compared to previous tech-
niques proposed in literature,
excelling in particular in the estimation of
low-frequent predicate-argument pairs.
Li et al. (2010) dealt with the task of WSD on words and multi-word
expressions proposing probabilistic frameworks based on topic models.
Inferring the set of topics from a Wikipedia dump consisting of 320,000
articles, using WordNet (Miller, 1995) based sense paraphrases and exper-
imenting diﬀerent context settings, the three models choose the best sense
by comparing the topic distribution of the instance under analysis with the
corresponding sense paraphrases. Authors report a state-of-the-art perfor-
mance for the proposed three models on the three evaluation tasks.
Topic modelling also found application as a means for historical study
in (Hall et al., 2008).
The authors apply LDA to the Association for Com-
putational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology to explore the trends character-
ising the ﬁeld and how they distribute across the main conferences and
workshops (Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP),
Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING) and so on).
The role played by topic modelling,
and in particular by LDA in the
metaphor recognition of metaphors is going to be discussed in Section
3.5.3.2.

Computational Modelling of Metaphors
3.5.1
Introduction
The wide range of approaches proposed in literature for the automatic pro-
cessing of metaphors all fall under the umbrella (multi-)term of
computa-
tional modelling of metaphor
.
Loosely speaking, when we talk of metaphor
modelling we refer to the process of
endowing
the machine with the
knowl-
54

edge
necessary to automatically perform two tasks (or more often, just one
of them):
metaphor identiﬁcation and metaphor interpretation.
Metaphor identiﬁcation systems are most of the times developed to
deal with the discrimination of the metaphorical or literal meaning of the
target linguistic unit under analysis.
The task is pretty much straightfor-
ward:
it is typically considered as a binary classiﬁcation
14
where the sys-
tem must be able to discriminate the literalness/metaphoricity of the par-
ticular lexeme.
Even though much less common,
some studies have focused instead
on the identiﬁcation of metaphors on a conceptual level:
in this case, the
task is to discover the metaphorical mapping between the source and tar-
get concepts identifying the linguistic item that ignites such association:
e.g.
“
light
with hope” reveals the conceptual metaphor FEELING IS FIRE
(Shutova and Sun,
2013).
In metaphor interpretation tasks the system is
developed to detect and explain the particular trope in text.
Up to now,
diﬀerent approaches have been proposed in literature, e.g. ﬁnding the cor-
responding conceptual metaphor (Fass, 1991; Martin, 1990) or paraphras-
ing the metaphorical expressions in a text-to-text form (Shutova, 2010a).
In order to carry out these tasks – no matter which one of these two – the
ﬁrst step in approaching the development of metaphor processing system
is the deﬁnition of its design.
As Shutova (2015, p.581) remarks, “[w]hen
designing a metaphor processing system one faces a number of choices.
Some stem from the linguistic and cognitive properties of metaphor, oth-
ers concern the applicability and usefulness of the system in wider NLP
context”.
The design process can be indeed thought as split in two depen-
dent stages, where the ﬁrst one informs the second one.
Its complexity is
reﬂected in the interplay of the multiple factors which it consists of, deﬁn-
ing the ﬁnal realisation of the model.
Thus, the metaphorical level of analysis and the corresponding linguis-
tic aspects are ﬁrst discussed, since not only deﬁning the scope of interest
and investigation, but also determining the computational techniques in-

volved in the development of the model.
In Section 3.5.3,
the literature
background on the use of unsupervised techniques for the metaphorical
identiﬁcation of metaphors in text is described in detail.
3.5.2
Level of analysis
When we decide to embark on the project of the computational investiga-
tion of metaphors, the ﬁrst question we have to ask ourselves is what kind
of metaphor we want to explore, detect and/or explain.
This step is fun-
damental because it inevitably
constrains
our approach to the task, ﬁnally
determining the implementation of the computational model itself.
We humans are unquestionably able to detect and understand metaphors
when we encounter one, maybe sometimes with some diﬃculties than in
most of the other cases.
However, metaphors do not have one single clear-
cut realisation in speech/text (especially if we think of them in terms of
single linguistic tokens) and there is not one unique level of analysis.
Let us take as a way of example one of the most renowned lines in the
realm of television entertainment:
(17)
Winter is coming
15
For those who are acquainted with the television show the phrase is ex-
tracted from, they know that this motto goes way beyond its literal mean-
ing since standing for the diﬃculties and the menaces that lie ahead of us,
prompting to a constant state of vigilance and warning.
This metaphor
displays diﬀerent level of analysis.
At a linguistic level the term
winter
does not stand (only) for the coldest season of the year,
ergo being used
in a metaphorical way.
Thanks to this reasoning, it is possible to infer the
hidden meaning of the entire phrase itself (not reﬂecting upon one single
15

term),
hence uncovering another level of analysis.
In fact,
it can be ob-
served that a conceptual metaphor HARD TIMES ARE COMING as THE
APPROACHING OF A SEASON seems to emerge.
We are indeed led to
experience these hard times associating only some relevant harsh aspects
of the winter season.
Such a complex reasoning is often realised by humans in a matter of
seconds, making it appear as a very simple task.
However, this is not the
case when it comes to the machines,
where each single level of analysis
needs to be treated as single process. Thus, in the design of a metaphor pro-
cessing system, linguistics plays a major role in informing the metaphori-
cal level of analysis on which the machine will operate on.
Following the
invaluable categorisation provided by Shutova (2015), four main levels of
metaphorical analysis can be distinguished:
•
Conceptual metaphor
•
Linguistic metaphor
•
Extended metaphor
•
Metaphorical inference
Conceptual metaphor
.
As explained in (17), the conceptual metaphor
refers to cognitive mechanism described by Lakoﬀ and Johnson (1980)
by which we process metaphorical
expression and more precisely,
the
metaphorical mapping between concepts of the source and the target do-
main.
One of the most fascinating examples of this kind of metaphor ever en-
countered is the one described in (Lakoﬀ and Johnson, 1980, p.144): PROB-
LEMS as a CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE. The authors explain to have found
it out by listening to the word of an Iranian student that, unlike their west-
ern colleagues, perceived the problems “as things that never disappear ut-
terly and that cannot be solved once and for all”. Indeed, when hearing the
phrase “the solution of my problems”, the Iranian student thought about it
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
57
as “a large volume of liquid, bubbling and smoking, containing all of your
problems, either dissolved or in the form of precipitates, with catalysts con-
stantly dissolving some problems (for the time being) and precipitating out
others”.
Although a system able to deal
with conceptual
metaphors would
also have a clear advantage in the detection and
treatment
of linguistic
metaphors,
to this day the most challenging factor is represented by the
building of such knowledge, with humans tending to disagree on the la-
belling and assignment
of source and target
categories (Shutova,
2015,
p.584).
Extended metaphor
. An extended metaphor is considered as such if its
realisation can be observed at discourse level, via the use of a metaphori-
cal lexicon (ergo, the target domain) that consistently draws upon the same
source conceptual domain. Hillary Clinton’s concession speech is exempli-
ﬁes this kind of metaphor:
(18)
Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass
ceiling, but someday someone will – and hopefully sooner than we
might think right now.
16
In her words,
her disappointment it is at the same time a call for ac-
tion and project the achievement as a container which
physical boundaries
must be broken.
This example is a proof of the importance of metaphor
as a tool of communication and as an argumentative strategy, as also high-
lighted by several scholars (Musolf, 2000; Lakoﬀ, 2008; Beigman Klebanov
and Beigman, 2010; Cap, 2013).
Metaphorical inference
.
Shutova (2015, p.585) deﬁnes the metaphor-
ical inference as “grounded in the source domain and [resulting] in the
production of surface structures we observe in language as metaphorical

expressions”.
In broader terms,
it represents the process of inferring the
hidden
meaning of the conceptual metaphor in use.
Let us take as a way of example the extended metaphor uttered by Paul
Broun - Representative for Georgia’s 10th congressional district - stating
that:
(19)
[...]
when someone is overextended and broke, they don’t continue
paying for expensive automobiles;
they sell the expensive automo-
biles and buy a cheaper one. They don’t continue paying for country
club dues, they drop out of the country club.
17
In this case, one needs to infer that Rep.
Broun is comparing the ﬁnan-
cial situation of his country to the average U.S. family that needs to cut all
the needless spending, “put this ﬁnancial house back in order” and stop
spending money on something they currently cannot aﬀord.
Nonetheless, a system able to perform such a reasoning is today a chal-
lenging route not yet pursued.
The
walls
to be overcome are indeed rep-
resented by the immense knowledge that this system should be endowed
with, not to mention the complex association between diﬀerent domains.
Linguistic metaphor
.
The linguistic metaphor represents the surface
realisation of the underlying metaphorical cognitive reasoning.
For exam-
ple, let us have a look at the following statement from the American politi-
cian and current U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry’s:
(20)
White House has been occupied by
giants
but from time to time it is
sought by the small-minded [...]”

Computational Modelling of Metaphors
59
In (20) we easily realise that the
giants
he is talking about are neither
mythical creatures or very tall people.
He is indeed making reference to
the former U.S. Presidents.
Thus, the linguistic metaphor can be considered as the straightforward
encounter in either speech or text of the metaphorical expression, both for
humans and machines.
Indeed,
in the computational text-modelling of
metaphors systems typically receive as input the metaphorical expression,
and their basic requirement is to be able to detect and/or interpret the lin-
guistic metaphor.
This level of metaphorical analysis has been widely investigated by the
NLP community, as the works of Gedigian et al. (2006), Turney et al. (2011),
Sporleder and Li
(2009),
Heintz et al.
(2013),
Shutova et al.
(2016) have
shown (just to mention a few).
Nonetheless, although having in common
the same level of analysis, each approach may present diﬀerent shades of
metaphorical investigation. Indeed, as Shutova (2015) points out, when de-
signing a system exploring the metaphorical expression per se, one should
take into account three fundamental linguistic aspects in the realisation of
the linguistic metaphor.
•
Level of conventionality
.
The level of conventionality ideally rep-
resents the metaphorical
degree of metaphoricity of the linguistic
metaphor.
By nature,
metaphors emerge in language as
novel
but
as their use becomes widespread in everyday language, they tend to
lose their aspect of novelty, turning into
conventionalised
metaphors
(Nunberg, 1987).
When this process takes place in language, it may
result in a sense extension,
augmenting the polysemy of the term
itself.
Furthermore,
as Lakoﬀ (1993,
p.245) points out,
”[t]he sys-
tem of conventional conceptual metaphor is mostly unconscious, au-
tomatic,
and is used with no noticeable eﬀort [...]”,
bringing them
closer to the use of literal terms:
e.g.
“She can
read
his mind”.
Dif-
ferent perspectives have emerged in literature about metaphoricity
(Gibbs, 1984), with the most recent one represented by Dunn (2010)
viewing it as gradient continuum and also proposing a computa-
60
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
tional scalar measurement (Dunn, 2014) for the degree of metaphor-
ical
charge
.
•
Syntactic constructions
.
To address the level of analysis of the lin-
guistic metaphor is important to set in advance the syntactic con-
struction that the system will investigate (e.g.
verb-noun, adjective-
noun and so forth).
Selectional preferences (Wilks, 1975) have been
indeed widely investigated, showing that metaphors can be detected
as a violation of the semantic constraints posed by the predicate.
Thus,
syntax is a fundamental feature to be taken into account in
the development of the system.
•
Lexical,
relation or sentence level
.
This linguistic aspect concerns
the level of annotation of the metaphor.
Three levels are categorised
by Shutova (2015):
the lexical or word level,
where the source do-
main words are tagged;
the relational level,
where the source and
target terms in a particular grammar relation are tagged;
the sen-
tence level, where the sentence is tagged according to the presence
of metaphorical terms in it.
3.5.3
Metaphor identification:
related work
As it will be discussed in Chapter 6, the metaphor processing systems de-
veloped in this dissertation deal with the task of metaphor identiﬁcation,
focusing on the level of analysis of the linguistic metaphor (cf.
Section 6.3
for a detailed account of systems’ features) and not relying on any lexi-
cal resource.
Thus,
according to the scope of the present work,
previous
approaches concerned with this speciﬁc task in the ﬁeld of the computa-
tional modelling of metaphors are discussed in this section.
Furthermore,
following the title and the content of the current chapter, particular atten-
tion will be paid to works dealing with metaphor identiﬁcation employing
unsupervised techniques and limiting their recourse to lexical resources.
As described in Section 3.5.1, in the task of metaphor recognition the
system must be able to discriminate between the literal and metaphorical
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
61
use of the target unit.
Thus, in a text-metaphor processing system, given
the textual input,
the developed framework typically returns a label for
categorising the unit as either metaphorical or literal.
The task has been
widely investigated in literature,
with the majority of the approaches fo-
cusing on the linguistic level of analysis.
A few words must be spent about the early methods since playing a
relevant inﬂuence in the computational research on metaphors.
First ap-
proaches to the task were characterised by the use of lexical resources and
especially inﬂuenced by Wilk’s selectional preferences (Wilks,
1975).
In-
deed, since selectional preferences can be seen as the semantic constraints
the a word
forces
on the the other terms that are syntactically connected
to it (Roberts and Egg,
2014),
a selectional
violation may indicate the a
metaphor is in use (Wilks,
1978;
Shutova and Sun,
2013).
Renowned is
Wilks (1978, p.199)’s example related to the act of drinking, “My car drinks
gasoline”, where the inanimate object ‘car’
erroneously
ﬁlls the role of sub-
ject in its syntactic construction with the verb ‘drink’.
The model that probably best exempliﬁes this early approach to the
computational investigation of metaphors can be considered Fass (1991)’s
met*.
Indeed,
working on selected examples,
the system leverages selec-
tional restrictions contained in a speciﬁc knowledge base for the detection
of metaphors, subsequently drawing on a second knowledge structure for
the discrimination of metaphors from anomalies.
The main drawback of
the system – as indicated by the author himself – is that selectional re-
strictions tend to detect any kind of anomalies in text,
ergo not just the
metaphors.
Nonetheless, selectional preferences have kept on playing a fundamen-
tal role in the computational investigation of metaphors. Indeed, since rep-
resenting an “important source of semantic information about the proper-
ties of concepts” (Shutova, 2015, p.610), they have lead to the interpretation
of metaphor as a violation of semantic norms, as a phenomenon breaking
the ﬂow of literal meaning in text (Hovy et al., 2013; Shutova et al., 2016).

Unsupervised approaches to metaphor recognition
During recent years,
multiple factors have fostered the research on the
computational modelling of metaphors towards the use of unsupervised
techniques. The rise of machine learning, the implementation of new pow-
erful techniques,
the mounting need of trying to
do without
high-quality
but at the same time
expensive
lexical
resources,
and the trend towards
language-independent models are amongst the reasons that have led the
NLP community towards this new path of research.
Although not having as ﬁnal aim the recognition of metaphors but in-
stead the discrimination of literal or non-literal usage of verbs,
the TroFi
(Trope Finder) system developed by Birke and Sarkar (2006) can be consid-
ered as one of the early approaches to the treatment of non-literal language
employing
nearly
unsupervised techniques.
TroFi performs the classiﬁca-
tion of non-literal language as a word-disambiguation task where literal
and not-literal usages are considered as two diﬀerent senses of the same
word.
The existing similarity-based WSD KE algorithm (Karov and Edel-
man,
1998) is adapted to the task of discriminating sentence clustering.
TroFi employs seed sets annotated by their literal or non-literal sense.
The
target set consists of the ‘88-‘89 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Corpus and is
tagged without human supervision (Ratnaparkhi et al. (1996)’s tagger and
Bangalore and Joshi (1999)’s Super Tagger are used). The system computes
the similarity between the sentences containing the target word and all the
collections of seed sentences.
The clustering of the sentences in the target
set as literal or non-literal is performed according to the seed set to which
they are attracted to.
25 verbs were chosen for evaluation, with a total of
1298 corresponding sentences extracted from the WSJ Corpus for literal-
ness annotation.
Inter-annotators agreement (in this case the annotators
are the authors themselves) is measured at
k
= 0
.

.
TroFi reaches an
average F-score of 53.8% on the hand-annotated sentences.
Not explicitly working on the task of
sheer
metaphor identiﬁcation,
Sporleder and Li
(2009) proposed an unsupervised cohesion-based ap-
proach to the task of discrimination between literal
usage of language
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
63
and idiomatic expressions.
Inspired by the work of Hirst et al. (1998) on
malapropisms and grounding their approach on the notion of lexical co-
hesion and lexical chains – i.e. the sequences of semantically related words
representing the lexical cohesion over a portion of text (be it a sentence, a
paragraph and so forth) – the intuition of the authors is that idioms
break
the cohesion of the text: if a word in the linguistic expression does not take
part in any lexical chain,
the expression is then prone to have been used
idiomatically.
The authors compute semantic relatedness using the distri-
butional approach of the Normalized Google Distance measuring semantic
similarity between two words.
Two classiﬁers were developed:
a weakly
supervised chain-based classiﬁer and a fully unsupervised graph-based
classiﬁer where vertices are content words and their corresponding edges
represent the semantic relatedness between them.
17 idioms were chosen
for the evaluation step, extracting their occurrences from the Gigaword cor-
pus (Graﬀ and Cieri, 2003) with two paragraphs before and after the one
including the idiom itself. Annotated as
literal
or
non-literal
, the authors re-
port an inter-annotator agreement of
k
= 0
.
7
. For comparison, the authors
implemented an informed baseline classiﬁer where expressions are tagged
as literal if the noun is found in the context, as metaphorical otherwise, and
a supervised classiﬁer checking word overlap of the target expression with
the literal and non-literal instances in the training set, classifying it accord-
ingly. Results of the evaluation are reported in terms of accuracy, precision,
recall and F-score.
The lexical chain classiﬁer globally optimised using an
oracle outperforms the other unsupervised classiﬁers with a reported F-
score of 60.53%. However, the graph-based classiﬁer compares favourably,
with an F-score of 59.02%.
Furthermore, the authors state the the globally
optimised chain classiﬁer is “an upper bound for the lexical chain classiﬁer
that would not be obtained in a realistic scenario” Sporleder and Li (2009,
p.760).
Nonetheless, it is the supervised classiﬁer to outperform the other
classiﬁers, hinting at the importance of the context as a cue of idiomaticity.
The approach of Shutova et al. (2010) was the ﬁrst one to employ unsu-
pervised techniques for the task of automatic metaphor identiﬁcation, as
64
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
claimed by the authors.
Their system uses word clustering techniques for
detecting verb-subject and verb-object metaphorical constructions in un-
restricted text.
A small dataset consisting of annotated expressions where
verbs are used metaphorically – as in the previous syntactic constructions –
exemplifying source-domain mappings is used as
starter
seed set.
Spectral
clustering using syntactic and semantic features is employed to expand the
original seed set clustering nouns,
representing the target concepts,
and
verbs,
representing source domains.
Their hypothesis is that,
by observ-
ing and learning the analogies in the seed set, the system is able to capture
such regularities clustering together abstract concepts associated with the
same source domain while target concepts are brought together by mean-
ing similarity.
The scope of the experiments is the whole British National
Corpus (BNC) (Burnard,
2007).
The system is evaluated against human
judgements where an inter-annotator agreement of
k
= 0
.
63
is measured.
A precision of 0.79 is reported.
Since no large metaphor-annotated cor-
pus was available, recall score is not provided.
Furthermore, authors state
that being the system seed-dependent, the recall would be questionable (al-
though anyway stated to have harvested a total number of 4456 metaphors
from BNC).
The authors evaluate their method also against a WordNet
baseline, where the synsets are used as source and target domains, report-
ing a higher coverage of the system in the retrieving of new metaphors and
a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to the 0.44 precision baseline score.
A fully unsupervised approach for the automatic identiﬁcation of
metaphors in unrestricted text was proposed by Shutova and Sun (2013),
discovering both metaphorical associations and metaphorical expressions.
Their method is based on a hierarchical
clustering model.
Indeed,
the
authors start from a hierarchical graph factorisation clustering of nouns
returning a network of clusters with diﬀerent levels of generality where
the weights on the edges represent the associations between the clusters,
hence indicative of the metaphorical associations. A dataset including 2000
most frequent nouns in the BNC corpus was used for clustering.
Gram-
matical relations of verb lemmas with direct object,
subject and indirect
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
65
object nouns included in the dataset are used as features for clustering.
After having obtained the graph of concepts,
metaphorical
associations
are found using the weight connecting the clusters.
After extracting the
source-target domain mappings, a list of salient features for the metaphori-
cally connected clusters is generated by ranking them according to the joint
probability of a particular feature of occurring both with the input noun
and the cluster.
Finally, the system searches the BNC for the metaphorical
expression describing the target domain using the verbs extracted from
the set of salient features.
The authors evaluate the performance of their
model
against human judgements and other two baselines represented
by an agglomerative clustering baseline (AGG) and a supervised baseline
built upon WordNet (WN). On the task of the identiﬁcation of metaphori-
cal expressions the system attains a precision of 0.69, beating the AGG and
WN baseline but not the human ceiling one set at 0.80.
Recall was mea-
sured against a gold-standard of manually annotated 63 mappings, result-
ing in 0.61 for the system developed by the authors.
As for the recognition
of metaphorical expressions, the hierarchical graph model was evaluated
against human annotations of sampled sentences tagged as metaphorical
by the system and the baselines,
asked to mark the expression that were
metaphorical in their opinion.
The hierarchical graph reaches a precision
of 0.65, outperforming the baselines AGG and WN but not the human ceil-
ing measured at 0.79.
Recall was not evaluated due to the lack of a large
metaphor-annotated corpus available.
With the growing attention of the NLP community to word embed-
dings,
a trend towards approaches drifting away from lexical resources
has been observed.
Knowledge built using word embeddings has proved
to yield satisfactory results in many NLP applications.
Do Dinh and Gurevych (2016) have recently undertaken this line of re-
search in the ﬁeld of computational processing of metaphors.
The authors
rely solely on word embeddings as their knowledge-base, combining them
with neural networks for the task of metaphor identiﬁcation.
A multilayer
perceptrons (MLP) is chosen as feedforward neural network.
The task is
66
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
treated as a tagging problem at content-token level,
hence extending the
existing framework for NER of Reimers et al. (2014).
The authors use pre-
trained 300-dimensional word embeddings created with Word2Vec from
the Google News dataset (Mikolov et al., 2013c) and take training and test
data from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus (henceforth
VUAMC) (Steen et al., 2010).
Search grid is performed on the validation
sets for determining the best setting of the network, tuning it according to
the best F-score. Their system is measured on precision, recall and F-score,
reporting the corresponding scores,
0.58,
0.52 and 0.55,
and beating the
pseudo-baseline of labelling each token as metaphorical.
The authors also
experimented with the incorporation of 10-dimensional POS embeddings
and concreteness ratings,
improving the overall performance not signiﬁ-
cantly though.
Shutova et
al.
(2016)
presented the ﬁrst
multi-modal
method for
metaphor
recognition by combining linguistic and visual
knowledge.
Their approach is based on the cognitive ﬁndings claiming that mean-
ing representation can be seen as a combination of multiple factors, “not
merely a product of our linguistic exposure, but are also grounded in our
perceptual system and sensori-motor experience [(Barsalou, 2008; Louw-
erse, 2011)]”(Shutova et al., 2016, p.162).
Both text and visual knowledge
are represented by word embeddings, which are learnt separately and then
combined in the multi-modal system.
Visual embeddings are learnt in a
similar way to the work of Kiela and Bottou (2014), using the deep learn-
ing architecture Caﬀe (Jia et al., 2014) to extract image embeddings from
a deep convolutional neural network trained on the ImageNet classiﬁca-
tion task (Russakovsky et al., 2015).
Due to the scope of the present dis-
sertation, I only discuss the linguistic modality of the system since of in-
terest for the aim of research.
The authors obtain linguistic representa-
tion using Mikolov et al. (2013a)’s skip-gram model and the linguistically
pre-processed Wikipedia as corpus.
Two diﬀerent kind of embeddings
are used for the experiments:
100-dimensional word-level emebeddings
are learnt in a ﬁrst step, using the standard skip-gram model with nega-
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
67
tive sampling; in the second step, 100-dimensional phrase embeddings are
learnt rerunning the skip-gram model but keeping the same contex vectors
of the word-level stage.
The phrase embeddings are extracted according
to the syntactic structure that are due to be analysed,
namely verb-noun
and adjective-noun phrases.
Several arithmetical operations are proposed
for measuring metaphoricity.
The intuition is that if the two embeddings
show a high degree of similarity, the phrase is then supposed to be literal
since belonging to the same domain.
On the contrary,
the expression is
considered metaphorical.
For the classiﬁcation of the single instances, an
optimal threshold is determined for the proposed scoring methods max-
imising classiﬁcation accuracy on a small annotated development set.
The
system is evaluated against the datasets of Mohammad et al.
(2016) and
Tsvetkov et al. (2014) annotated for metaphoricity.
Authors report evalua-
tion scores in terms of precision, recall and F-score. The MIXLATE method
- combining the best linguistic and visual scoring strategies - outperforms
the other scoring methods reporting the F-score of 0.75 for verbs and 0.79
for adjectives. However, the linguistic WORDCOS method, computing the
cosine similarity between the
word
1
and the
word
2
in the phrase, compares
favourably to the best performing method in both tasks.
3.5.3.2
Topic modelling metaphors
Among the new paths pursued by research on the computational mod-
elling of metaphors, the topical structure of text has been gaining increas-
ing attention in the community as a clue for the detection of metaphors.
Strzalkowski et al. (2013, p.69) hypothesised indeed that metaphors can
be identiﬁed by looking at the words “ typically found outside the topical
structure of the text”, similar to approaches grounded on the idea of lexical
chains.
On the same line, Beigman Klebanov et al. (2009) show that terms
describing the topic of discussion are less likely to be used metaphorically.
As pointed out by Shutova et al.
(2016,
p.610),
the interpretation of the
topical structure as a clue for metaphoricity “is somewhat similar to the
idea of semantic norm violation as an indicator of metaphor”,
although
68
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
diﬀering in “two crucial ways”:
the modelling of the source and target
domains and the wide context of analysis.
Taking into account theories suggesting that the wide structure of ap-
pearance of the metaphor can provide rich understanding clues (Kittay,
1990), Beigman Klebanov et al. (2009) adopted a more
global
look at the in-
vestigation of metaphors (if compared to previous “localistic” approaches)
hypothesising that words are less likely to be used metaphorically if they
describe a common topic of discussion in a corpus of relevant documents
(Beigman Klebanov et al., 2009, p.1).
To test their hypothesis, the authors
build a large corpus of articles about European Union Institutions from
three British newspapers and evaluate the topical composition of the doc-
uments annotated for metaphoricity. LDA is applied to the corpus to iden-
tify discourse topics. In order to have a better description of the topic itself
a parameter
k
was used to control topic assignment,
where
k
represents
the top most likely number of words for the particular topic.
If the word
falls in the top
k
, then it is assigned to the topic.
Annotation data are ex-
tracted from Musolf (2000)’s work on the study of recurrent metaphors in
European integration process since, as authors state, the choice of the data
predated the construction of the corpus.
From Musolﬀ’s list of source do-
mains,
4 were chosen along with the 128 corresponding articles plus 23
articles from other source domains (for a total of 151 documents).
9 anno-
tators worked on the data (8 undergraduate annotators and Musolﬀ’s orig-
inal annotation).
The
k
inter-annotator agreement for the source domains
of LOVE and VEHICLE was 0.66, while for AUTHORITY and BUILD was
respectively 0.39 and 0.43.
The ﬁt between the annotated documents and
the corpus is measured using topical coverage (as the authors point out
a large discrepancy in the length of texts between annotated documents
and the corpus’ ones is observed since annotated data are not actually a
sample of the developed corpus).
The authors sampled corpus’ texts that
were at least 343 words long and compared them to the annotated docu-
ments, resulting in
p >
0
.
37
for every
k
. The results of the experiment con-
ﬁrmed authors’ hypothesis: for
k
= 25
, about 15% of the indexed words in
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
69
the document are considered topical, capturing only 3% of metaphors; for
k
= 400
, 22% of words are metaphorical in about 53% of topical indexed
words.
Although not consisting in a task of metaphor identiﬁcation,
the
work of Beigman Klebanov et al. (2009) represents a ﬁrst quantitative proof
of the importance of the large
picture
for the study of extended metaphors.
Minimising the recourse to rich linguistic resources, Heintz et al. (2013)
employed LDA technique for the task of metaphor recognition.
As the au-
thors state, their work is inspired by Bethard et al. (2009) where the topics
generated by LDA are used as features for the Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model to classify the target unit as either literal or metaphorical.
The intuition behind their approach is that LDA’s output can be used an
approximation of conceptual domains. Heintz et al. (2013, p.59) follow this
intuition hypothesising that words appearing in sentences containing both
source and target domains vocabulary are likely to be used metaphorically,
using LDA topics as “proxies for semantic concepts”.
Unlike Bethard et al.
(2009), the authors minimise the supervision in their system using an ex-
tended large collection of potential source concepts and a small human-
crafted list of seed words.
Topics are inferred from the Wikipedia arti-
cles in the target language,
aligned to concepts using the seed list,
map-
ping the topic to at most one concept.
The system selects sentences where
words are strongly associated to source and target concepts, ﬁltering sen-
tences presenting a source concept common to the whole document (cf.
Beigman Klebanov et al. (2009)) and sentences containing too few words
not included in LDA stopwords. Evaluation data were collected from news
websites and blogs focusing on the target concept of governance. Two kind
of evaluations were performed:
in the ﬁrst one, the top ﬁve examples for
each conceptual
metaphor were selected and judged by two annotators
(
k
= 0
.
48
), reporting an average F-score of 0.59 (results are only reported
for English due unavailability of Spanish annotators at the time).
In the
second evaluation for both English and Spanish language, the top 250 lin-
guistic metaphors in the corpus were selected and judged for metaphoric-
ity using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
For English, a mean metaphoricity of
70
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
target instances 0.41 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.33) and of 0.39 (SD = 0.26)
for conceptual metaphors is reported.
For Spanish,
a mean metaphoric-
ity of target instances of 0.33 (SD = 0.23) and of 0.31 (SD = 0.16) is in-
stead returned. Authors comment on the results pointing out that many of
the metaphors missed by the system are instances of primary metaphors,
suggesting that these are “not well-characterized by word co-occurrence”
(Heintz et al., 2013, p.64).
Other major issues are to be found in frequent
ﬁxed phrases,
the non-correspondence between most of the source con-
cepts with LDA topics and the diﬃculties in the annotation process for
judges.
Navarro-Colorado and Tomas (2015) proposed a fully unsupervised
approach to the task of metaphor recognition.
The main assumption be-
hind their method is that metaphors are linguistic items having an un-
conventional referent or “[colligating] in an unconventional way (Goatly,
1977)” (Navarro-Colorado and Tomas,
2015,
p.92).
By leveraging topic
models, the authors detect the unconventionality of the word by compar-
ing its set of topics with those of the context.
If the sets are not similar,
the word is deemed to be used metaphorically.
More precisely, if the word
shares at least one topic of the context, then its meaning is labelled as lit-
eral.
The context is considered as the words co-occurring with the tar-
get term having as boundaries the sentence containing them.
LDA is run
on Wikipedia,
used as reference corpus,
for the generation of the topics.
Word-topic relations in Wikipedia are considered as conventional.
Given
a new target corpus, the system ﬁrst extracts the sentence.
Then, a vector
of topics is created using those previously associated to each word in the
Wikipedia corpus and the same step is performed for the target term.
Fi-
nally, the system classiﬁes the word as literal or metaphorical if it shares
topics with its co-occurrences terms.
The system was evaluated on a cor-
pus of 100 Spanish sentences comprising only two target words (
desierto
and
oasis
), hence divided on two balanced subcorpora.
The baseline set is
to 50% accuracy since following a majority class approach.
Eight experi-
ments were carried out varying at each run the number of topics extracted
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
71
and the number of representative keywords for each topic.
Results are re-
ported in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-score.
For the ﬁrst ex-
periment (
desierto
),
the best setting is registered with 1000 topics and 20
keywords reporting a 0.72 F-score.
In the second experiment (
oasis
),
the
best F-score is of 0.68 when choosing 2500 topics and 50 keywords.
The
work indicates that using less keywords, the system performs better.
Due to the aim of the present dissertation, I decided to make a selection
of the relevant literature accordingly,
hence inevitably discarding some
studies.
Relevant works leveraging topical structure for the investigation
of metaphors as those of Strzalkowski et al. (2013) and Beigman Klebanov
et al.
(2014) were not mentioned,
since either supervised approaches or
methods drawing on several rich linguistic resources.
Nonetheless, stud-
ies focusing on this line of research have been enriching the literature pro-
duced so far,
with recent works being strongly inﬂuenced by these ap-
proaches (Jang et al., 2015; Haagsma and Bjerva, 2016).
3.5.4
Evaluation of the metaphor processing system
As we have seen in the previous sections, the lack of a common framework
forging the deﬁnition of annotation, task and evaluation strategies – among
others things – in the ﬁeld of the computational modelling of metaphors,
has generated a fragmented picture.
Taking a closer look at the evaluation
strategies proposed so far, it is possible to observe how varied in literature
the approaches are, due to the lack of shared dataset crucial for the devel-
opment of the ﬁeld in the NLP panorama.
As Shutova (2015, p.613) points
out, “[t]he most desirable type of evaluation is that conducted against an
[...] naturally occurring, continuous text [corpus] manually annotated for
metaphor [...] open-domain and representative of a range of genres”.
Nonetheless,
thus far studies having followed this invitation can be
count on one hand (cf.
Shutova et al. (2010) in 3.5.3.1),
with the work of
Dunn (2013c) standing out for conducting an evaluation of four systems
leveraging diﬀerent methods for metaphor identiﬁcation (i.e.
Sporleder
and Li (2009), Turney et al. (2011), the approach developed by Shutova et
72
Chapter 3.
Unsupervised Methodologies for Metaphor Recognition
al.
in the works of Shutova (2010b),
Shutova and Teufel (2010),
Shutova
et al. (2010) and Shutova et al. (2013), and the author’s system developed in
Dunn (2013a)), comparing their performance on the VUAMC (Steen et al.,
2010) by genre and sub-class of metaphor.
The study provides important
information on the
desirable
metaphorical properties of the system for its
successful performance, working on two versions of the same dataset, one
pre-processed for NER and the other without this step.
The author had
previously conducted the same system comparison in (Dunn, 2013a), this
time using as evaluation dataset the Contemporary Corpus of American
English (from now on CoCA) (Davies, 2009) (although not representing a
metaphorical annotated corpus, in this study the author annotates a sam-
ple using the labels
metaphorical
,
literal
and
humorous
),
showing that dif-
ferent performance results with regard to work of Dunn (2013c) might be
explained by the characteristics of the corpus used for evaluation.
Indeed,
the author states that results show that metaphor discriminating linguistic
properties may be not applicable to every genre as there is a signiﬁcant dif-
ference between each type of communication. Furthermore, diﬀerent kind
of metaphors have diﬀerent linguistic properties.
Notwithstanding the works of Dunn (2013c,a), to this day it is still hard
to ﬁnd a common shared dataset for performance comparison, due also to
the diversity of the approaches characterising the research on metaphor.
Recently,
the VUAMC seems to have emerged as a common standard of
comparison in many studies present
in literature focusing on the task
of metaphor identiﬁcation (Beigman Klebanov et al., 2014; Haagsma and
Bjerva,
2016;
Do Dinh and Gurevych,
2016).
The VUAMC is indeed to-
day the largest available corpus annotated for linguistic metaphors using
the MIPVU procedure (Steen et al., 2010), an extension of the MIP (Prag-
glejaz Group,
2007) framework for empirical
annotation.
The corpus is
a subset of the BNC’s Baby Corpus,
from which texts from four regis-
ters, consisting of approximately 188,000 lexical units, were randomly ex-
tracted.
The VUAMC represents a pioneering work in the ﬁeld of research
on metaphors,
not only for its coverage and since being freely available,
3.5.
Computational Modelling of Metaphors
73
but also for the coding of sub-classes of metaphors.
However,
as it has been shown in Section 3.5.3,
“the majority of ap-
proaches created their own test sets, making the results not directly com-
parable” (Shutova, 2015, p.613). If this fragmented picture is not favourable
for an eﬀective growth of the ﬁeld of research – making it hard to look for a
silver lining – the hope rests in the deﬁnition of a common line of research
as prompted by the remarkable study of Shutova (2015) but also in future
works that may unlock the treasure chest of resources being developed so
far.

Chapter 4.
Building and development of an atypical political corpus
4.2
Background
4.2.1
Some premises
The resource developed in this work and being used as dataset of analysis
is the CompWHoB (Computational White House press Brieﬁngs) corpus
(Esposito et al., 2015).
As the acronym goes, this corpus collects the tran-
scriptions of the White House Press Brieﬁngs, namely the daily meetings
held by the White House Press Secretary for the national and international
news media.
The CompWHoB is the computational development of the
pre-existing White House Press Brieﬁngs Corpus, built by Marco Venuti at
the University of Naples Federico II, annotated with XML mark-up follow-
ing the TEI Guidelines (Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen, 2006) and mainly
used as resource in corpus-linguistics studies (Venuti et al.,
2012;
Spinzi
and Venuti, 2013).
4.2.2
The White House Press Briefings
The White House Press Brieﬁngs (from now on WHoBs) represent one of
the most important and symbolic strongholds in the recent history of U.S.
political communication.
Reading Perloﬀ (1998,
p.98),
their success does
not come as a surprise as U.S. have been dedicating much more time and
resources to the communication process rather than to the actual stages of
decision-making (at least, until the second and last presidency of Trump’s
predecessor,
Barack Obama).
The importance of the WHoBs has signiﬁ-
cantly grown along the three last decades leaving an indelible mark also
on the spreading of the institutional communication across the web.
In-
deed,
since the ﬁrst term of Bill Clinton’s presidency,
WHoBs have been
transcribed and uploaded to the web,
making them available worldwide
to an heterogeneous public.
The pivotal role played by WHoBs in U.S. communication strategies has
been underlined by scholars and White House media professionals alike.
Quoted in the work of Kumar (2010, p.55), Jim Kennedy – communications
4.2.
Background
79
director for the White House Counsel’s Oﬃce during Clinton’s presidency,
appointed to “focus exclusively on the communications aspects of scandal”
– points out that the press brieﬁng is like a
duel
.
In fact, since being also
televised, Press Secretaries have to be ready to answer questions provoca-
tively posed by the press corps which are in turn “looking for an on-camera
response”.
Jim Kennedy is not the only one to look at these conferences as more
than just a confrontation between two opponents. The military metaphor is
indeed recurring across political and linguistic literature, viewing the press
brieﬁngs as “the battleﬁeld for the press secretary” (Spinzi
and Venuti,
2013,
p.183) where “[a] civilized,
rule-bound war is fought”(Partington,
2003, p.111) (in some way, reinforicing the conceptual metaphor
argument
is war
introduced by Lakoﬀ and Johnson (1980)).
This permanent state of
tension, a soft
cold war
between press secretary and press corps, is stressed
by Partington (2003) when he deﬁnes the relationship between the two star-
ring characters as
rules of engagement
, drawing the phrase from the work of
the BBC political correspondent Nicholas Jones (1996). It is no coincidence
that the 46th Vice President of the United States and Congressman, Dick
Cheney, argued that “You don’t let the press set the agenda.
They like to
decide what’s important and what isn’t important.
But if you let them do
that, they’re re going to trash your presidency” (Maltese, 1994, p.2).
Thus, the role played by the press secretary turns out to be critical in
addressing and interacting with the media corps,
as probably best sum-
marised by the words of Marlin Fitzwater, longest serving press secretary
under Reagan and H.W. Bush presidencies,
stating that “the press secre-
tary always ﬁghts with one arm behind his back, trying to serve two mas-
ters” (Nelson, 2000, p.1), namely the U.S. administration and the media.
In each press brieﬁng,
everybody seems to win.
Undoubtedly,
press
secretary’s main tasks are those to deliver oﬃcial information about the
President’s daily schedule, explain administration’s policies and decisions,
provide commentary on current events and answer the questions coming
from the journalists (Kumar, 2010).
However, as Spinzi and Venuti (2013)
80
Chapter 4.
Building and development of an atypical political corpus
highlight, WHoBs have more than an informative function and carry with
them a two-sided gain-eﬀect:
on the one hand,
the press has the chance
to daily
test
White House corps and getting the information they need; on
the other one, the White House can spread the
desired
information and at
the same time “get an immediate feedback on the success or failure of their
policies and communication strategies”(Spinzi and Venuti, M., 2016, p.92).
At the end, their relationship can be seen as one of interdependence and
cooperation (Venuti et al., 2012, p.67).
The main features of each WHoB and its well-deﬁned structure were
described by Partington (2003, pp.34-36).
In the following lines, the most
important characteristics for the aims of the present dissertation are sum-
marised:
•
Setting
.
WHoBs take usually place in the oﬃce of the White House
Press Secretary, inside the White House itself.
•
Channel
.
It
is mainly spontaneous speech but
sometimes the
podium reads a prepared statement, also known as
readout
.
•
Topics
.
They may range widely.
They range from updates about the
President’s schedule to culture and education, from internal politics
to foreign aﬀairs.
•
Participants
.
The podium and the press media corps.
As for the discourse structure of the single brieﬁng, I still follow Part-
ington (2003, pp.34-36)’s outline. Each WHoB can be indeed split into three
main blocks:
•
Introduction
.
The podium either reads out or summarises a pre-
pared statement on the latest White House business.
•
Question and response
. The podium answers the questions coming
from the press corps.
This part of the brieﬁng usually makes up the
longest part of the event.

4.2.3
White House Press Briefings as an atypical institutional
genre
Due to the peculiar features that
make them stand out
from the wide
panorama of political press conferences, WHoBs have drawn the attention
of many scholars so far.
WHoBs have been regarded in literature as an
atypical kind of institutional talk (Spinzi and Venuti, 2013).
Quoting Part-
ington (2003, p.30), a press brieﬁng is more pragmatically deﬁned as a “talk
between professionals and lay people [...], between two groups of profes-
sionals with an audience of lay persons (the TV and Internet audience)”.
Indeed, the task of the press secretary is not only to address the press corps
present in the room, but also “those [people] whom the messages reach in
the end” (Bhatia,
2006,
p.176) – i.e.
the media-users – making the press
brieﬁng both a political and media discourse.
Being WHoBs daily conferences, the setting of the brieﬁng can be cate-
gorised as rather informal: participants know each other very well indeed,
although asymmetry is still in place being the podium the one leading the
interaction (Venuti et al., 2012, p.67-68).
Due to the non-formal setting of
the brieﬁngs,
the conversation often switches from one social register to
another, from informality to formality (and viceversa).
In fact, quoted by
Kumar (2010,
p.235),
Mike McCurry – White House Press Secretary for
Clinton’s administration – stated that “[t]he problem with the format and
the problem with the job is that you have to wear diﬀerent hats at diﬀerent
moments”.
Thus,
WHoBs can be summarised as an atypical
institutional
genre
where the brieﬁng takes place in a non-formal setting in which the podium
– being the one leading the conversation – talks at the same time to the
press and to the world.
Furthermore, the podium shifts between the use
of a
transactional
language,
“the optimally eﬃcient transmission of infor-
82
Chapter 4.
Building and development of an atypical political corpus
mation” (Partington, 2003, p.154), and
interactional
language, “[which] pri-
mary goal [is] the establishment and maintenance of social relationships”
(Partington, 2003, p.155).
In particular, this last peculiar trait of the genre
represents a fascinating aspect of investigation under a linguistic perspec-
tive.
Indeed,
not only do the press brieﬁngs display the use of language
as a tool of communication but also as a device of manipulation, enriching
in this way the repertoire of linguistic features displayed by the podium of
every discourse.
The present dissertation proceeds along its investigation path taking
into account the above-described features of the genre under analysis.
4.3
Political corpora across fields
The search for specialised data represents an endless quest across the NLP
community where genre has proved to play a great importance.
In the last
two decades, academic literature has indeed shown that political corpora
in particular have been gaining a growing importance not only in NLP but
also across a wide spectrum of research areas. The interest shown by schol-
ars for this speciﬁc genre can be probably explained by the paramount role
played by the political dimension in every society around the globe and by
the ever-increasing attention paid by media to the political speech per se.
The interplay between diﬀerent research ﬁelds once far away has also gen-
erated a great deal of interest in the building of political resources.
This is
the case of the PolMine-Project
1
, where NLP and the social sciences come
together to turn pre-existing politically relevant texts into corpora to be in-
vestigated using computational techniques.
Already in 2005 Cousins and McIntosh (2005) advocated the necessity
for the social sciences of harnessing and applying the information tech-
nologies to the political research in order to augment human intellect (En-
gelbart, 1962).
The authors provide an insightful and detailed outline on

the integration of computing power in the process of collection and analy-
sis of the data of increasing scope and scale, discussing the potential gains
coming from Information Technology (from now on IT) but also the limi-
tations of its tools, with a view to a greater eﬃciency and transparency.
When it comes to political corpora, it is always hard to draw a straight
line that could set apart one research ﬁeld from the other. Thus, in this sec-
tion an overview of the political resources built as results of works in wide
interdisciplinary ﬁelds only marginally involving NLP methods is ﬁrst pro-
vided.
Corpora and approaches to the analysis of political discourses de-
veloped using computational linguistics
2
techniques are then discussed.
4.3.1
Political Resources
The unstoppable expansion of the web over the last decades has made pub-
licly available online data once restricted only to small domains and/or
with a very limited access.
The interest on these data and the desire to
build properly structured resources have represented a signiﬁcant boost in
the rise of political corpora in literature. Designed and usually constructed
in a semi-automatic way and looking at diﬀerent phenomena of investiga-
tion, many political corpora are indeed today directly available for use on
web platforms, often results of works in the ﬁeld of corpus linguistics.
The Honk Kong Baptist University Corpus of Political Speeches
3
is an
online database that collects political speeches from around the world and
also features parallel corpora of English and Chinese Hong Kong Policy
Address.
It has represented a source of investigation for many and diﬀer-
ent studies, also focusing on the investigation of metaphors (Ahrens, 2009).
Bevitori (2007) presented a corpus of discourses of the two Houses of
the Parliament of the United Kingdom having as topic the war in Iraq. The
resource is annotated with socio-linguistic features for the investigation

The Hansard corpus

is a semantically tagged resource that contains
the British Parliament speeches from 1803 to 2005 and allows to ﬁnd entire
classes of related words based on their context scope.
Finally, a recent work from Merz et al. (2016) has presented an open-
access, multilingual and annotated corpus of electoral programs based on
the collection of the Manifesto Project (Volkens et al., 2015), which includes
the largest hand-annotated text corpus of electoral programs.
4.3.2
Political Corpora in NLP
If the building of large political resources has raised the interest of the sci-
entiﬁc community during the last decades, it has only been recently that
the NLP community has applied computational linguistics techniques to
both the development and the analysis of political corpora.
Although mainly developed to aid research on Statistical
Machine
Translation,
the Europarl Parallel Corpus (Koehn,
2005) can be probably
considered one of the most relevant works in this panorama. The Europarl
is a diachronic parallel corpus collecting the proceedings of the European
Parliament and including eleven languages.
It can be consulted and in-
vestigated for diﬀerent aims of research, ranging from the linguistic to the
most political ones, using the CQPweb(Hardie, 2012) platform
5
or via the
corpus management system Sketch Engine
6
(Kilgarriﬀ et al., 2014).
Barbaresi (2012) developed the German Corpus of Political Speeches
crawling the online archive of the German Presidency

.
The corpus was
tokenised and POS-tagged using TreeTagger and it was released in XML
and Unicode format.

Political corpora across ﬁelds
85
Osenova and Simov (2012) built the Political Speech Corpus of Bulgar-
ian providing a detailed annotation for topics,
both at
document
and
sen-
tence
level, and for speakers, ﬁnally performing sentiment analysis anno-
tation considering subjective and objective statements.
Guerini
et al.
(2008,
2013) developed the Corpus of Political
tagged
speeches (CORPS), a corpus collecting political speeches from the Web and
tagged with speciﬁc audience reactions – such as
laughter
,
booing
,
etc.
–
used to identify markers of persuasion.
As for the automatic analysis of political communication in text cor-
pora, literature keeps on thriving day by day.
Thomas et al. (2006) created
a corpus extracting all the available transcripts of U.S. ﬂoor debates in the
House of Representatives from 2005,
together with voting records for all
the roll-call votes.
The authors used the data to predict the support or the
opposition to a piece of legislation, also detecting agreement between ut-
terances in a discussion.
Sim et al. (2013) built a corpus of contemporary political writings from
books and magazines manually annotated by a political science domain
expert with coarse and ﬁne-grained ideology labels.
The authors inferred
ideological cues from the annotated corpus and then applied a bayesan
Hidden Markov Model (henceforth HMM) to infer the proportion of ide-
ologies U.S. Presidential candidates used in their campaigns in 2008 and
2012.
Prabhakaran et al. (2014) analysed the 2012 Republican presidential pri-
mary debates to study the dynamics of interaction in the political debates
observing topic shift features and how they relate to the notion of power
(Prabhakaran et al., 2013).
Recently, Brigadir et al. (2015) employed Distributional Semantic Mod-
els (from now on,
DMSs) and a Critical Discourse Analysis’ (henceforth
CDA) framework for the analysis of opposing ideologies tweets from the
the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum and the 2014 U.S.
Midterm
Elections.
In the same vein, working on the CompWHoB corpus, Esposito et al.
86
Chapter 4.
Building and development of an atypical political corpus
(2017) proposed the use of the Temporal Random Indexing (Basile et al.,
2015) – a speciﬁc DSM framework that can take into account word mean-
ing change over time – in conjunction with CDA theories to investigate the
politically choices made by the podium during the so-called
crisis commu-
nication management
moments (Coombs, 2007).
With regard to the automatic classiﬁcation and annotation of politi-
cal texts,
working on the corpus of public statements given by Margaret
Thatcher (Collins,
1999),
Beigman Klebanov et al.
(2008) proposed three
methods for the automatic annotation of political texts.
They found that
Latent Dirichlet Allocation as unsupervised word clustering is useful for
tracing topics while dictionary-based methods using the statistical
tool
WMatrix (Rayson,
2003) are more eﬀective for comparative studies.
The
authors also proposed the lexical cohesion analyser (Beigman Klebanov,
2007)
for semantic representation trained on the experimental
data of
Beigman Klebanov and Shamir (2007).
Purpura and Hillard (2006) focused on sorting process of the Congres-
sional Bill Project proposing a topic spotting classiﬁcation algorithm based
on SVM techniques, with a two-phase hierarchical approach in training to
greatly reduce the computational sorting costs.
Working on the classiﬁ-
cation of political emails according to the sending party during the 2004
U.S. presidential election, Purpura et al. (2006) proved the eﬀectiveness of
binary diﬀerentiation between
Republican
and
Democratic
sources.
4.4
The CompWHoB corpus
4.4.1
Before the CompWHoB: the WHoB Corpus
In the beginning, there was the White House Press Brieﬁngs corpus (hence-
forth WHoB corpus).
Developed by Marco Venuti
at the University of
Naples Federico II, the WHoB corpus (Spinzi and Venuti,
2013) is a spe-
cialised corpus covering nearly eighteen years of U.S. Press Brieﬁngs – from
January 1998 to June 2011 – and ﬁve presidencies.
The corpus was manu-
4.4.
The CompWHoB corpus
87
ally annotated using XML markup and following the TEI Guidelines out-
lined in Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen (2006).
The main information
encoded in each XML tag concerns the role and the name of the podium
(if applicable),
details about the brieﬁng venue and extra-linguistic phe-
nomena present in the transcriptions:
e.g.
pause
,
laughter
, etc..
The corpus
was indexed and investigated using the Xaira (XML Aware Indexing and
Retrievable Architecture) package (Xiao, 2006), an open-source tool devel-
oped at the Oxford University used to explore any corpus marked up in
XML, since supporting TEI out of the box and any other XML schema.
The WHoB Corpus has been mainly used as resource for studies in the
ﬁeld of corpus linguistics so far.
Venuti et al.
(2009) used a 4-word key-
cluster analysis on the WHoB Corpus to investigate the main features re-
sulting from the evolution of the press brieﬁngs during Clinton and G.W.
Bush presidencies. Among other results, the study reveals the tendency of
Bush ﬁrst presidency to highlight the role of the president by putting him
into the foreground.
In Venuti et al. (2012), the authors investigated the role of the podium
in his attitude towards the press in a diachronic perspective.
As shown
in Section 4.2.3,
due to the non-formal setting of the brieﬁng itself,
one
of the peculiar trait emerging from the genre is the
switching
role of the
podium according to the
transactional
or
interactional
use of the language
made. Focusing on the phrase
I don’t know the answer
uttered by the podium
across the corpus,
authors show that their analysis conﬁrms the shifting
role of the podium as an avoidance strategy in order to
preserve the face
, as
stated by Partington (2003).
Furthermore, the analysis highlights that the
communication strategies adopted by the podium diverge according to the
diﬀerent presidency taken into account.
A phraseological study was carried out by Spinzi and Venuti (2013)
to explore the discourse aspects of the press brieﬁngs as an institutional
genre.
Focusing on ﬁve 4-word clusters,
their analysis on Clinton,
Bush
and Obama’s presidencies claims to demonstrate the correlation between
power of persuasion and the shifting role ability of the podium.
Further-
88
Chapter 4.
Building and development of an atypical political corpus
more, the authors point out the high frequency of mental verbs – e.g.
think
,
believe
,
understand
– which conﬁrms that the conversation genre is one of
most relevant in U.S. press brieﬁngs.
4.4.2
The CompWHoB corpus:
motivations
As mentioned in Section 4.2.1,
the CompWHoB corpus is the computa-
tional
upgrade
of the pre-exisiting WHoB corpus.
The decision to develop
this project was mainly prompted by the necessity to automatise the pro-
cess of construction and annotation of the corpus.
Indeed, semi-automatic
annotation comes at a cost:
not only is it time-consuming but also prone
to inevitably oversight errors that can aﬀect the ﬁnal result.
Furthermore,
relying only on specialised tools for the retrieval of the desired informa-
tion from the Web represented an obvious limitation for a more deﬁned
customisation of the corpus. The ﬁnal objective was to employ NLP and IT
techniques to build a resource that could be used as a future reference in a
wide spectrum of research ﬁelds, ranging from political and social sciences
to computational linguistics, just to name a few.
4.4.3
Corpus overview
The CompWHoB corpus is a diachronic corpus collecting the transcripts
of the daily U.S. press brieﬁngs extracted from the American Presidency
Project (henceforth APP) website
8
, where the
Press Brieﬁngs
section archive
can be freely consulted.
As stated on the website’s homepage, the APP –
a non-partisan and non-proﬁt project – “is the leading source of presiden-
tial documents on the internet”.
The APP is a result of the collaboration
between J.T. Wooley and G. Peters (Woolley and Peters, 2008) and it is ac-
tually hosted at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The CompWHoB corpus covers a time-span of nearly twenty-ﬁve years,
ranging from 1993 to 2017,
and it
is automatically updated month by
month.
Thus,
the corpus includes the three full presidencies of William

The CompWHoB corpus
89
J. Clinton,
George W. Bush,
Barack H. Obama,
plus the early days of the
ﬁrst term of the incumbent U.S.
president,
Donald J.
Trump.
The latest
press brieﬁng collected goes back to May 31, 2017.
Following the original work of Venuti, data are collected and format-
ted into a standardised XML encoding,
according to the TEI Guidelines.
As shown in Table 4.1, at the time of writing the CompWHoB corpus con-
sists of a total of 5,900 brieﬁngs (indicated in Table 4.1 as
texts
), comprising
33,124,918 tokens and 191,268 types. Given the dialogical characteristics of
the brieﬁng, 583,688 turn-takings
9
were computed. Along the investigated
time-span, 1,164 is the number of the individually identiﬁed speakers tak-
ing on the role of

with an asterisk as data are still incomplete (only the brieﬁngs of his early
days of presidency have been collected).
4.4.4
Corpus construction and annotation
The ﬁrst step in the construction of the CompWHoB corpus is represented
by the extraction of the press brieﬁngs data from the APP website.
Press
brieﬁngs transcripts come in a loose standardised format. Each conference
presents a well-deﬁned structure where every turn-taking between speak-
ers is signalled by the use of capital letters.
Two roles can be categorised
in the transcripts.
The ﬁrst is the podium – be them the press secretary
or any other administration oﬃcial taking on its role – identiﬁed by the
use of the speaker’s surname preceded by the corresponding honoriﬁc or
job title.
The second is the press corps, always identiﬁed by the letter
Q
.
Both information about podium and journalists come in capital letter in
the transcripts.
The original information contained in the transcripts was retained, in-
cluding the date of each brieﬁng.
After extracting the data, the resulting
texts were encoded in an XML format following the TEI Guidelines.
Tran-
scripts were mapped to XML ﬁles according to a calendar year division
and metatextual information was kept in order to enrich the corpus. Thus,
the resource is diachronically structured and each year ﬁle reproduces the
same timeline that can found on the APP’s
Press Brieﬁngs
archive section.
The CompWHoB corpus shows the following XML structure.
A
div1
tag is created to mark the beginning and the end of
the single brief-
ing,
while its attribute value displays the date of the speciﬁc event in a
yyyy-mm-dd
format.
Every
div1
includes the dialogical
structure of the
brieﬁng,
where each speaker is identiﬁed via a
u
tag.
All the press con-
ferences contained in a single year are included and can be retrieved using
the
text
tag.
More formally, the CompWHoB corpus can be deﬁned as follows:
be-
ing
C
the corpus,
Y
the set of the years contained in it and
B
y
the collection
of brieﬁngs in each year, the dataset can be formalised as:
4.4.
The CompWHoB corpus
91
C
=

In turn, each collection of brieﬁngs
B
y
can be seen as:
B
y
=
{
b
|
year
(
b
) =
y, y
∈
Y
}
Finally, considering
b
as the single instance of
B
, the dialogical struc-
ture characterising the corpus
C
is represented as:
b
∈
C
:
b
=
< u
1
, u
2
, ..., u
n
>
u
is the utterance pronounced either by the podium or the journalist
and
n
is the total length of
b
.
Referring to
u
as document,
u
i
can be con-
sidered as the
i
-th document consisting of a number of tokens in a range
{
1
, t
}
, where
t
is the total length of
u
i
.
In order to provide extralinguistic information about the speakers in-
volved in each brieﬁng, every
u
tag consists of self-explanatory multiple at-
tributes:
role
,
job
,
gender
,
age
and
who
.
As in the transcripts the press corps
is only recognised via the use of the capital letter
Q
, it was not possible to
extract information about them.
Thus, every attribute values is ﬁlled with
the label
journalist
except in the case of
age
, instead ﬁlled with
u
, namely
un-
known
.
With regard to the podium, press secretaries are not the only ones
recognised as such.
Since many are the White House members involved
in the conferences, be them administration oﬃcials or personnel related to
the White House, the value
podium
is assigned to the attribute
role
for all
the speakers interacting with the journalists.
As the original transcripts also include meta-textual information about
non verbal
event
descriptions (e.g.
laughter
,
pause
,
oﬀ-the-record
),
self-
closing tags were created to store this valuable information as shown in
Table 4.2.

4.4.4.1
Automatising the structural annotation
In Esposito et al. (2015), the authors ﬁrst presented a semi-automatic ap-
proach for the structural annotation of the corpus based on the use of reg-
ular expressions and manual lookup on Wikipedia. This decision was mo-
tivated by the several inconsistencies detected in the transcripts when it
comes to the identiﬁcation of the speakers.
Indeed,
the use of diﬀerent
honoriﬁcs and the sometimes
optional
punctuation were the main cause
for the incorrect detection of the speakers.
Due to this reasons, rules were
devised using regular expressions together with manual checks.
In Cimmino et
al.
(2016),
the authors fully automatised the anno-
tation process leveraging the structured information contained in the
publicly available databases DBpedia
10
(Lehmann et al.,
2015) and Wiki-
data
11
(Vrandečić and Krötzsch, 2014).
More precisely, each podium is ﬁrst
identiﬁed using the information about the presidency in which it is in-
cluded,
their surname and the corresponding honoriﬁc to conﬁrm their
gender.
Then, the system starts looking for the podium’s ﬁrst name in the
text of the particular brieﬁng. If it fails, the system then looks for the name
in the White House oﬃcial website
12
and ﬁnally queries DBpedia and Wiki-
data to retrieve the necessary information. System’s performance was eval-
uated computing the error rate in the failed recognition of the podium for
each year, according to the following formula:

Table 4.3 describes the performance of the system on each year of the
corpus.
As it can be observed, the annotation process produces an error rate of
0.38%, which can be considered a very small percentage in relation to the
total number of podiums correctly identiﬁed. Furthermore, as the brieﬁng
collection stops at the early days of Trump’s presidency, a high error rate is
computed in 2017 as the number of brieﬁngs is still far from the total count.
Thus, not only did the automatisation of the structural annotation pro-
cess remove the need of time-consuming manual checking but it did also
enrich the corpus, making it easily navigable for the user. Indeed, since re-
trieving essential information from DBpedia and Wikidata, it is now pos-
sible to discriminate between the diﬀerent roles of the podium, making ac-
cessible precious extralinguistic data which can better deﬁne the panorama
under analysis.
4.4.4.2
NLP annotation
As regards the NLP aspect, the CompWHoB corpus was initially linguis-
tically annotated using the Python Natural Language ToolKit (henceforth
NLTK) library (Bird et al., 2009).
The pipeline consisted of four steps:
sen-
tence segmentation,
word tokenisation,
POS-tagging and lemmatisation.
The POS-tagging was performed using the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,

In order to improve system’s performance,
the NLP pipeline was re-

extended to include also a dependency parser.
The choice behind the use
of SpaCy was motivated not only by the wide range of functionalities that
SpaCy freely oﬀers, but especially by its fast syntactic parser performance
with a high rate of accuracy if compared to the current state-of-the-art pars-
ing technologies (Choi et al.,

Overview of the chapter
In this chapter the lexical units under analysis and their relevance for the
purposes of the present thesis are discussed. Section 5.2 presents the inves-
tigated linguistic units, namely the verbs of motion.
After describing the
motivations that led to the choice of this Levin’s verb class, the criteria for
the selection of the motion verbs to be investigated are discussed and their
distribution in the CompWHoB corpus is described.
Statistical measures
are also provided to prove the representativeness of the selected verbs.
In
Section 5.3, the procedure for the annotation of the verbs of motion for the
ﬁnal task of metaphor recognition is illustrated.
Section 5.3.1 explores the
metaphoricity of the target units discussing the results of the ﬁrst annota-
tion task.
In Section 5.3.2 the procedure for the annotation of the test set
to be used for the evaluation of the developed systems is explained and
described in detail.

Customising the corpus for the task
5.2
The lexical units under analysis:
the
verbs of motion
As previously described in Section 2.6, in the present thesis the linguistic
units under investigation for metaphoricity are represented by the terms
belonging to the class n°51 of
verbs of motion
type delineated by Levin in her
pioneering work “English Verb Classes and Alternations:
A Preliminary
Investigation”(Levin, 1993).
As shown in Section 2.5,
the primary reason leading to the choice of
this category stems from the relevance of the these lexical
items in the
communication strategies deployed by U.S.
administration in public dis-
course.
However, this does not represent the only motivation behind this
choice.
Looking at a more linguistic aspect, it needs to be stressed the role
played by the verbs of motion as metaphorical
carriers
, as several studies
have shown so far.
Investigating metaphors in educational discourse, Cameron (2003) car-
ried out a corpus study on all parts of speech, ﬁnding out that about 50%
of metaphors detected in text were represented by verbs.
Proposing an annotating scheme for the annotation of conceptual map-
pings,
Shutova and Teufel (2010) focused on the detection of metaphori-
cal or literal use of verbs on a sub-corpus of the British National Corpus
(Burnard,
2007) divided by genre.
Two interesting aspects emerge from
their study: 164 of the total 241 metaphors identiﬁed are indeed verbs and
the most frequent source domain is the one of MOTION.
Furthermore –
with a particular view to the present dissertation – authors point out that
the source domain of MOTION is mainly associated to the target concepts
of CHANGE,
PROGRESS,
CAREER and SUCCESS,
showing how these
metaphors shape our cognitive mappings.
Gedigian et al. (2006) also proved the pervasiveness of verb metaphors.
Indeed, investigating verbal units from a subset of the Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) corpus, the authors report that the 93% of the target frames of spatial
motion, manipulation and health are annotated as metaphorical.
5.2.
The lexical units under analysis:
the verbs of motion
99
Finally,
as previously discussed in Section 2.5,
Cap (2014) indicates
the crucial role played by verbs (phrases) of motion and directionality as
markers of spatial movement – be them physical or not – in the cognitive-
pragmatic paradigm of
proximization
,
where these linguistic units are
shown to form a signiﬁcant part of the discursive strategies applied by the
speakers in the realm of political discourse.
Thus,
interesting aspects emerge from the above-described brief
panorama:
not
only do verbs tend to be used most
of
the times in a
metaphorical way (even though not very surprising as genres seem to play
a big part in this picture) but the component of motion is relevant in build-
ing metaphorical associations that forge our vision of reality. Furthermore,
verb phrases of motion stand out in the political context as tools in the
hands of the speaker to manipulate bystanders’ attention and perception
of the unfolding situation around them.
Due to the atypical political nature of the corpus developed as part of
the present thesis, the role played by motion verbs undoubtedly becomes
of great interest from a research point of view both under a quantitative
and a qualitative analysis of their interplay in this speciﬁc genre.
5.2.1
Motion verbs identification
Under a computational-linguistic perspective,
in the present dissertation
motion verbs are considered as all the instances of word-forms POS-tagged
as verbs – hence any verb forms – encountered in the CompWHoB corpus
and which lemmas can be found in Levin’s class n°51 of verbs of motion.
Thus, given the following toy sentence:
(21)
The Russian military
is advancing
their borders posts in the Geor-
gian territory.
the verb
advance
in his present continuous form is selected since be-
longing to the class 51.1 of the
inherently directed motion
verbs.
The motion verbs to be selected are contained in the
Verb Index
, a ﬁle
including the alphabetical listings of the verbs referred to in Part I and II
100
Chapter 5.
Customising the corpus for the task
of “English Verb Classes and Alternations:
A Preliminary Investigation”
and made available by Beth Levin
1
.
The
Verb Index
is organised in a dic-
tionary data-format fashion where each key represents the verb and the
corresponding value is its semantic classes.
In the present work, verbs are
extracted from the reverse-engineered ﬁle developed by John M. Lawler
2
where for each verb class a list of the verbs belonging to it is provided. The
full list of the
verbs of motion
identiﬁed by Levin can be found in Appendix
B, detailed according to the section they belong to as reported in her
Verb
Index
.
Levin divides the verbs of motion in nine classes semantically deﬁned.
As it can be observed, some of the verbs may be found in more than just
one class (e.g.
drift, climb), making in some cases the semantic distinction
between classes a little bit fuzzy.
However,
each class is considered as a
semantically coherent set of verbs which share a similar syntactic linguistic
behaviour.
Flicking through the Verb Index of the class n°51, the sub-class of
run
verbs belonging to the more extended
manner of motion
class, stands out as
the most numerous one, indeed consisting of 124 units.
The
manner of mo-
tion
class as a whole collects a total of 142 verbs.
On the contrary, the class
of
leave
verbs identiﬁes only three linguistic items. Particular interest raises
the class of
waltz
verbs, describing a very speciﬁc lexicon that however is
likely to be encountered only in specialised contexts and genres.
Nonetheless,
the diﬀerence between classes (and sub-classes) in the
verbs of motion does not play a relevant role for the aims of the present dis-
sertation.
The nine classes are indeed categorised and treated as a whole
set describing the verbs of motion.
The candidate verbs of investigation
drawn from the class n°51 and the selection of procedure are to be dis-
cussed in the next sections.

5.2.2
Verbs of motion classes in the corpus
Identiﬁcation of motion verbs was performed parsing the CompWHoB cor-
pus and looking for tokens POS-tagged as verbs
3
and included in Levin’s
verbs of motion classes.
This process returned 149 verbs out of the total of
247 included in the verbs of motion classes.
Table 5.1 illustrates the list of
the motion verbs found in the CompWHoB corpus and their correspond-
ing verb type classes.
Although not crucial to the aims of the present dissertation, it is of in-
terest that each of the n°51 verb classes is represented in the corpus.
As
expected, the
run
verb class stands out for its cardinality also in the Comp-
WHoB corpus, featuring 77 verbs out of the 124 identiﬁed by Levin. Unex-
pectedly, also the
waltz
class gets represented in the corpus, even though
including only the 35% of verbs of the
original
class. In Figure 5.1
4
, the hor-
izontal bar chart illustrates the cardinality of verbs of motion sub-classes.
However, as it can be observed in Figure 5.2
5
, despite the lower number
of verbs if compared to the
run
sub-class, it is the class of
inherently directed
motion
to cover the lion’s share in terms of frequency in the corpus. Indeed,
this class includes some of the most recurring verbs in the CompWHoB
corpus, as nine of them occur more than 1000 times.
In this case, it must
be highlighted that this class also features high-occurrence terms such as
go
and
come
which are ubiquitous in many verbal syntactic constructions
in language (e.g.
phrasal verbs,
auxiliary roles in expressions of futurity
and so forth).

5.2.3
The motion verbs of the corpus
As described in 5.2.2, the identiﬁcation process returned 149 motion verbs
out of Levin’s
original
247.
Interpreting the corpus as a long series of
question-and-answer between journalists and podium,
motion verbs are
drawn only from podium’s utterances.
This choice is based both on re-
search interests and on the features used by the developed systems for
metaphor detection.
Indeed, on the one hand, as highlighted by the prox-
imization theory (cf.
Section 2.5), not only does the podium represent the
main character of the press brieﬁngs, but it is in their words that the use of
motion verbs might play an important role in U.S. political communication
strategies.
On the other hand, in order to detect the literal or metaphori-
cal use of the motion verb, the systems needs to leverage its wide context
of occurrence, hence leading to discard all journalists’ questions.
Indeed,
the average word-length of journalists’ utterance is of 30.94 tokens, hence
not providing enough useful information for the approach to the task at
hand, while for podium’s documents
6
is instead reported at 87.96 words.
Thus, each motion verb was retrieved along with the utterance in which it
is included.
The pie chart of ﬁgure 5.3 graphically represents the overall frequency
distribution of motion verbs across the corpus
7
.
Despite the absence of la-
bels due to the plot space restrictions, it can be observed that about 71% of
the frequencies are condensed in the three verbs
go
,
come
and
move
, respec-
tively represented by the orange, light green and dark green slices.
The
inherently directed motion
verb
go
predominates,
occurring more
than 117000 times in podium utterances and representing the 46.8% the
verbs of motion present in the CompWHoB corpus.
Added up,

reach 60308 occurrences, amounting to about the 24% of the total fre-
quencies.
As previously said,
it must be pointed out that the prevalence
of these verbs is to be connected to their presence in several syntactic con-
structions, where they play the role of auxiliary verbs (e.g.
futuricity ex-
pressions) and/or form part of compound verbs with prepositions and/or
particles (i.e.
phrasal
verbs),
often
losing
their contemporary meaning.
Looking at the remaining nearly 30% of the pie chart described in Figure
5.3, 146 motion verbs are covered, with 16 of them reporting occurrences
above the thousand frequencies. Thus, it emerges a picture of 19 verbs
dom-
inating
the scene of the verbs of motion type, occurring in the range of the
thousand times and amounting to around the 96% of the total frequencies.

Chapter 5.

5.2.4
Selecting motion verbs for the task
A selection of the initial list of 149 identiﬁed motion verbs was made in
order to have a more informative representation of the data.
Verbs falling
into the range between the 30 and 10000 occurrences were selected for the
metaphorical recognition task.
High frequency verbs such as
go
,
come
and
move
were discarded since suggesting a wide use in syntactic construc-
tions and in conventional verbal phrases not providing enough informa-
tion about their metaphorical potential.
A low frequency boundary was
set at 30 occurrences – hence excluding verbs such as
bowl
,
pedal
and
trail
– since data provided by verbs falling below this threshold were deemed
not suﬃcient for the following stage of training and testing of the system,
making the building of an accurate word representation not an easy task
(cf.
Chapter 6).
Although it might be argued that this threshold is still too low for this
learning step, I made this decision based on my research curiosity towards
those motion verbs which potential metaphorical use could be of interest
for the present thesis.
Furthermore, raising the low frequency bar would
have drastically reduced the number of verbs selected for the metaphor
recognition task.
Applying the range between 30 and 10000 occurrences, 91 verbs were
discarded. More precisely, 88 were the motion verbs occurring less than 30
times in the whole corpus, while those which frequency was higher than
10000 were represented by only three verbs,
namely
go
,
come
and
move
.
Thus,
the ﬁnal selection returned 58 motion verbs,
which distribution in
the corpus can be observed in ﬁgure 5.4

The bar chart represents on the

About 33% is instead the slice of

The visual representation of the general syntactic-semantic character-

Distribution of the selected motion verbs in the corpus
Politically speaking,
the CompWHoB corpus can be ideally divided into
four
time spans corresponding to the last
four
U.S.
presidencies,
i.e.
William J. Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack H. Obama and Donald J. Trump
(in ascending chronological order).
Each presidency is characterised by
diﬀerent political communication strategies which are reﬂected – among
other things – also in the linguistic choices made by the podium during
each press brieﬁng.
As described in Section 4.4.3,
a total number of 33,124,918 tokens is
present in the whole corpus
10
with about 15% of them represented by
verbs, reporting a total of 5,014,210 frequencies across the four presiden-

cies.
Making reference to Levin’s verbs of motion class,
250,529 are the
occurrences of motion verbs collected from the corpus, ergo representing
around the 5% of the total of tokens POS-tagged by the SpaCy parser as
verbs. It follows that a motion verb is encountered in the CompWHoB cor-
pus every 0.04 verbs or more in general every 0.007 tokens.
In the light of the selection described in Section 5.2.4, let us have now a
look at the statistics of the motion verbs
chosen
for the metaphorical recog-
nition task.
The frequencies of the verbs falling into the pre-set range add
up to 72,351 occurrences across the whole corpus. The
selected
motion verbs
amount to the 28.87% of Levin’s verbs of motion classes and to the 1.44%
of the 5,014,210 verb occurrences in the four presidencies.
Thus, a
selected
motion verb can be found every 0.28 verbs of motion identiﬁed by Levin
and every 0.014 verbs in the corpus. The bar chart in Figure 5.6
11
describes
the distribution of the selected motion verbs per each presidency term (e.g.
Clinton_1,
Clinton_2,
Bush_1 and so forth) compared to the one of the
whole Levin’s class n°51 represented in the corpus.
The grouped bar chart shows on the
x
axis the three presidencies cov-
ered by the CompWHoB corpus
12
where the light blue and the less opaque
bars indicate respectively the selected motion verbs and overall class n°51
for each presidency term.
Each bar also displays the total frequency count
for the corresponding presidency term.
The
y
axis shows the frequencies
of the selected motion verbs.
As it can be observed,
the selected motion
verbs distribute quite similarly in Clinton and Bush presidency terms, with
a slight increase in their use in both presidential second terms. Comparing
the frequencies of the two distributions, it can be observed a quite similar
trend in each term as the verbs of motion represent around the 26-30% of
the overall instances of Levin’s class n°51.
However,
two outliers can be
detected:
the ﬁrst one is represented by the second term of Bush presi-
dency where, despite the higher use of verbs of motion, their percentage

decreases at the 20.67%.
The second outlier is starkly visible as motion
verbs occurrences in the second term of Obama’s presidency are almost
doubled compared to the ﬁrst one.
In this case, the verbs of motion rep-
resent the 39.27% of the overall instances of the class n°51 being used by
the podium.
The percentage diﬀerence recorded at 12.25% between the
two terms of Obama’s presidency is the higher recorded in this chart (the
diﬀerence between
Bush_1
and
Bush_2
is indeed recorded at 9.1%).
Going
back to Table 4.1 of Section 4.4.3, it can be observed that this trend is also re-
ﬂected in the number of tokens being used during each presidencies, with
a signiﬁcant increase in both Obama and Bush administrations.

5.2.6
Motion verbs representativeness
In order to test the representativeness of the selected motion verbs from the
CompWHoB corpus,
the CoCA corpus was used as reference corpus for
comparison. The CoCA is claimed to be the largest freely available and bal-
anced corpus of (American) English.
It is evenly divided into ﬁve genres,
comprising 220,225 texts and composed of more than 520 million words (I
refer here to the latest update of December 2015).
Each year of the corpus
consists of ﬁve genres – i.e.
spoken, ﬁction, popular magazines, newspa-
pers and academic journals – which texts are collected from a variety of
sources.
As the CompWHoB corpus only collects dialogical speech discourse
in the form of press brieﬁngs, the
spoken
section of the CoCA was chosen
for data comparison. Collecting the transcripts of unscripted conversations
from television and radio programmes (e.g.
All thing considered
(NPR),
To-
day Show
(NBC),
Good Morning America
(ABC), etc.), this part of the CoCA
corpus shares some signiﬁcant characteristics with the CompWHoB cor-
pus.
Indeed:
• data from both corpora are transcriptions of actual spoken conversa-
tions;
• although conversations are claimed to be unscripted,
a very small
percentage is represented by scripted material often used to as cata-
lyst for interaction between speakers;
• as discussed by Davies in the corpus characteristics section of the
website
https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/
, these transcriptions can-
not be considered as completely natural conversations.
Naturalness
is indeed altered by the fact that speakers know to be at the centre
of the stage, being broadcast on (inter-)national television channels
and/or radio programmes.
This factor inevitably alters their use of
language – one need only think of, for example, profanity.

In the light of the above-mentioned main properties of the two cor-
pora
13
, it came the decision of using the
spoken
CoCA as a reference corpus.
Looking at the data of the
spoken
CoCA, 109,391,643 is the total number of
words in this genre section.
Although freely available for access on its on-
line interface
14
,
the full-text download on one’s own machine of CoCA’s
data is only possible accepting to purchase the data.
Thus, the free option
download that gives access to a sample of the corpus was exercised.
The
spoken
CoCA sample consists of about 1.7 million tokens (punc-
tuation is excluded).
73,996 are the frequencies of the verbs detected by
the SpaCy parser in the data sample,
with 4,716 of these represented by
those included in Levin’s motion verbs classiﬁcation. With reference to the
motion verbs selection discussed in the previous sections of the current
chapter, 55 are the verbs being identiﬁed in the
spoken
section (
exit
,
jog
and
stumble
are not present in the sample). The frequencies of the 55
spoken
mo-
tion verbs sample were then updated to their proportional estimate, given
the total number of words of the whole population (109,391,643 tokens).
The ﬁlled area line chart of Figure 5.7

bution of the identiﬁed

corpora.
The
x
axis of the plot represents the selected motion verbs in common
between the two corpora and the

axis their corresponding frequencies.
The blue trace describes the frequencies of the CompWHoB corpus motion
verbs while the orange one those included in the CoCA selection.
To test
the representiveness of the CompWHoB corpus motion verbs, the t-test for
two independent sample of scores was performed on the null hypothesis

The spoken genre is obviously a sub-corpus of CoCA but it is regarded here as a
corpus on its own due to its characteristics and dimensions.

Annotating data for the task
In the ﬁeld of metaphor computational modelling, annotation for metaphoric-
ity has been mainly playing a double role: exploration of the data (be them
later processed by the system or not) and evaluation step of the computa-
114
Chapter 5.
Customising the corpus for the task
tional model.
As regards the use of annotated data as evaluation strategy, the reason
for that must be traced back to the lack of a common framework for system
development and testing in the research on the computational modelling
of metaphors, as discussed in Section 3.5.4.
Indeed,
missing
guidelines in
the ﬁeld have lead researchers to develop their own evaluation strategies
based on the data they were provided with.
So far, studies have described a variegated picture when it comes to the
evaluation stage.
In Shutova et al. (2013) human annotators were asked to
express their judgements on the output of the metaphor processing sys-
tems.
Mason (2004) carried out one of the two evaluations leveraging the
mappings of the Master Metaphor List (Lakoﬀ et al.,
1991),
to this day
the largest catalogue for conceptual metaphors (arising from the works of
Lakoﬀ and Johnson (1980) and Reddy (1979)) and possibly resembling one
of the few standard benchmarks in the ﬁeld.
In the present dissertation, annotation for metaphoricity has played the
double role of exploration of CompWHoB corpus data and test set for the
evaluation of the developed metaphor processing systems. The creation of
an
ad-hoc
test set – hence not resorting to any of those already available in
literature – was necessary due to the lexical units under analysis and the
peculiar characteristics of the texts of the CompWHoB corpus, which are
leveraged in the approach proposed in the present work (cf.
Chapter 6 for
the detailed discussion of the systems).
In particular,
it is the context of
appearance of the verb of motion – namely the whole utterance – to repre-
sent an important feature for the computational processing of metaphors.
Furthermore, being the CompWHoB a
spoken
corpus, its genre inevitably
restricted the possible range of potential data for evaluation.
As previously motivated in Section 5.2, the focus of metaphorical inves-
tigation is represented by the verbs of motion only uttered by the podium.
Data for annotation come in the form of the whole podium’s utterance, i.e.
the sentence including the motion verb and possibly the
n
sentences pre-
ceding and/or following it.
This choice is motivated by the characteristics
5.3.
Annotating data for the task
115
of the press brieﬁngs:
being a sequence of question-answer, it is often nec-
essary to resort to the whole context of appearance of the motion verb to
understand its meaning in text.
However, in some cases it is not even pos-
sible to retrieve it without going back to the question posed by journalists.
5.3.1
Annotation for data exploration
The aim of the ﬁrst round of annotation was to explore a sample of the
corpus data in order to get a picture of how selected motion verbs were
interpreted by the annotators in the atypical political context of the U.S.
press brieﬁngs.
Following the verbs of motion selection described in the current chap-
ter, 193 verb instances were randomly extracted from the corpus, for a to-
tal of 97 documents.
Three human annotators were chosen for this task
according to the following criteria: certiﬁed advanced level of English lan-
guage knowledge,
having lived abroad (in an English speaking environ-
ment, e.g.
English as a second language also in the workplace) for at least
5 months and having a basic background in linguistics.
Two annotators
were Italian native speakers while the other one was bilingual in English
and Italian.
Annotators were instructed either in person or via video chat
services.
The annotation procedure used as blueprint
for its framework the
metaphor identiﬁcation procedure (MIP) proposed by Steen and his col-
leagues (Pragglejaz Group, 2007; Steen et al., 2010) for the identiﬁcation of
metaphorical words in discourse.
The task they were presented to was the
identiﬁcation of the literal or metaphorical use of the motion verbs in con-
text.
With the term ‘literal’,
the basic meaning of the verb was intended,
i.e.
the more concrete and tangible, often the one closest to its etymolog-
ical one.
If the meaning of the verb in the particular context contrasted
its basic one but it could be understood in the terms of it,
then the verb
was to be regarded as ‘metaphorical’.
The annotators were provided with
three options for the labelling of the verbs of motion:
MTP
for metaphorical
use of the verb,
LTR
for the literal one and
UNK
whereby it was not possi-
116
Chapter 5.
Customising the corpus for the task
ble to identify the reading as either literal or metaphorical.
The detailed
procedure is illustrated in Appendix A.
Thus,
in this ﬁrst round the focus of the task was the annotation of
metaphors at a linguistic level distinguishing between literal and metaphor-
ical use of motion verbs.
Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss, 1971) was used to measure
agreement reliability between the three annotators,
returning
κ
= 0
.
35
(
n
= 3
, N
= 193
, k
= 3
), where
n
is the number of annotators,
N
the to-
tal number of motion verbs to be annotated and
k
the labels available for
annotation.
The result can be interpreted using Landis and Koch (1977)’s
criteria for the classiﬁcation of the strength of agreement between raters,
although the “divisions are clearly arbitrary [but] they do provide useful
“benchmarks” ”(Landis and Koch, 1977, p.165).
According to these inter-
vals, a
κ
statistic at
0
.
35
can be regarded as a
fair
agreement between anno-
tators. In order to further assess the inter-annotator reliability, I report here
also the Krippendorﬀ’s
α
, since this measure computes the disagreement
between raters.
On this task,
α
is measured at 0.35 (with values ranging
between 0 and 1).
The two inter-annotator measures reproduce similar values, showing
that the task was not as trivial as one would expect.
Even if a fair strength
of agreement is indicated,
the low
κ
and
α
scores provide signiﬁcant in-
formation about the very diﬀerent interpretation of the metaphorical and
literal meaning of motion verbs.
Annotators tend to agree more on the metaphorical use of verbs of mo-
tion. 55 are the cases on which the three annotators agree on metaphoricity
(28.48% of the total motion verbs), against the 44 on which they agree for
the literal meaning (22.79% given the total of 193 verbs).
Hypotheses for
discordance might be varied, although two are the main reasons that seem
to emerge from the data:
polysemy and possible
dead/frozen
16
metaphors
(Nunberg,
1987).
Indeed,
high polysemous verbs such as
run
and
turn
(interactively looking at Figure 5.5 it is possible to observe the WordNet
synsets of each verb) prove to cause much trouble in annotation, e.g.
follow

bringing agreement in only one case.
Dead
metaphors – i.e.
those expres-
sions so ingrained in our contemporary language to be assimilated into
literal
use (Nunberg, 1987, p.198) – might represent a cause of discordance
between annotators, as verbs such as
advance
and
conduct
showed, with the
latter one never being agreed upon by annotators.
Although it is obvious that the dataset must to be considered too small
to draw deﬁnitive conclusions, these data still provide indicative informa-
tion about the meaning and the use of motion verbs in the speciﬁc atypical
political genre of the CompWHoB corpus. Furthermore, they indicate that
dead
metaphors might represent a cause of discordance in the interpreta-
tion of the metaphorical expression.
5.3.2
Test-set annotation
In the second round of annotation, data to be used as test set for the eval-
uation of the computational metaphor modelling systems were annotated.
According to the criteria shown in 5.3.1, two were the human annotators
selected for the task.
Both of them were Italian native speakers, instructed
in person by the author of the present work.
The target focus of this second round of annotation reﬂects the ﬁnal
scope of the present work.
Annotators were asked again to identify the
literal or metaphorical use of motion verbs in text but this time at diﬀerent
level of metaphorical conventionality.
Indeed,
the interest of this task –
and of this research – was the identiﬁcation of the novel/unconventional
17
metaphors uttered by the podium in the realm of U.S. press brieﬁngs. This
metaphorical focus was mainly motivated by three aspects:
•
Metaphoricity of motion verbs
.
Motion verbs tend to be used
metaphorically to a greater extent, as previous studies have shown
(Cameron, 2003; Gedigian et al., 2006). This is particularly true when
the historical aspects of metaphors are taken into account in the an-
notation procedure.
17
The terms are used interchangeably in this context.
118
Chapter 5.
Customising the corpus for the task
•
Research interest
.
Bearing in mind the context of application of
metaphors – i.e.
the atypical political realm of U.S. Press Brieﬁngs
– novel metaphors may be indeed revealing of political communi-
cation strategies, as the cognitive-pragmatics ﬁndings of Cap (2013)
have shown.
•
Frozen/Dead metaphors issue
.
As Nunberg (1987)
highlighted,
metaphors evolve in time with some of
them
losing
their origi-
nal
metaphorical
charge,
as Section 5.3.1 also seems to suggest.
Since they become so entrenched in everyday language to lose their
metaphorical
status
, I pursue here the path of exclusion of these verb
instances from the range of metaphoricity.
Thus,
the description of the metaphorical level of conventionality for
the second annotation task is provided in Paragraph 5.3.2.0.1.
The charac-
teristics of the test set and the corresponding annotation results are to be
discussed in Chapter 7 at Section 7.2.1, when describing the evaluation of
the computational metaphorical modelling system.
5.3.2.0.1
Unconventional/Novel metaphors
With the terminology
novel
or
unconventional
metaphors, here I refer to those metaphorical expressions
that are readily interpreted as such by humans because they “are not sys-
tematically used within a language system” (Gelo and Mergenthaler, 2012,
p.160). Indeed, their understanding is not automatic since characterised by
“marked rhetorical eﬀects, whose comprehension requires a special imag-
inative leap” (Nunberg, 1987, p.198).
These metaphors have the power to
break our
logical
reasoning when we encounter them as they bring to light
an a-systematic association between two seemingly unrelated domains of
experience (e.g.
She was the sun warming my winter days
).
We can ﬁgure metaphors’
life
as a trajectory: metaphors are born as un-
conventional, result of “the idiosyncratic creative process of the speaker”
(Gelo and Mergenthaler,
2012,
p.160) and intuitively recognised as such
by the members of a linguistic community.
As metaphors take root in the
5.3.
Annotating data for the task
119
language system as an integral part of it, their meaning becomes so well-
established that “their comprehension becomes more automatic, and their
rhetorical eﬀect is dulled” (Nunberg, 1987, p.198).
When metaphors reach
this stage of their life,
they are termed as
conventional
.
Speakers process
them without any eﬀort, and most of the times without even realising that
they are dealing with this ﬁgure of speech.
Conventional metaphors are
“generally established as a mode of thought among the members of a lin-
guistic community” (Lakoﬀ and Turner, 1989, p.55).
Let us take as way of example the following headline from a well-
known newspaper webpage:
(22)
Time is running out for Madagascar - evolution’s last, and greatest,
laboratory
18
.
The metaphorical expression
time is running out
is so entrenched in ev-
eryday use of English language that some native speakers (but not only
them) may ﬁnd hard to recall its
original
metaphorical nature and its cor-
responding hidden concept TIME IS AS A LIMITED RESOURCE.
Nunberg (1987, p.198) deﬁnes as
dead
or
frozen
those metaphors which
common usage lead them not to be diﬀerent from those terms literally
used.
Describing the “Career of Metaphor”,
Bowdle and Gentner (2005,
p.199) suggest that a computational distinction could be deﬁned between
novel
metaphors, i.e.
base terms referring to domain-speciﬁc concept not
yet associated with a domain-general category (e.g.
Science is a glacier
), and
conventional
ones, i.e.
base terms referring both to a literal concept and an
associated metaphoric category (e.g.
A gene is a blueprint
).
Working in the
ﬁeld of political science,
Drulák (2005) suggests a more ﬁne-grained di-
vision for metaphors adding the
sedimented
layer to the
conventional
and
unconventional
metaphors.
The
sedimented
metaphors are interpreted as
18

extinction-plants-kew-gardens
120
Chapter 5.
Customising the corpus for the task
those communicated as having a literal meaning,
also referred to as
dead
metaphors.
The
conventional
ones are those processed without any eﬀort
as time wears them out, but still holding a metaphorical charge (e.g.
The
European Union has three pillars
).
Unconventional
metaphors are those pro-
viding insights and interpreted as incongruous, novel, “strong metaphors”
(Cameron, 1999,
p.131).
These works show that the lines of demarcation
becomes fuzzy when it comes to try to draw a clear-cut distinction between
diﬀerent degrees of metaphorical usage.
Thus, keeping in mind what said so far, in the present thesis the iden-
tiﬁcation of novel metaphors is realised according to the following binary
distinction:
under the umbrella term
literal
, instances of motion verbs be-
ing used either literally (ergo displaying their basic meaning) or as conven-
tional metaphors are included. Using the label
metaphorical
, only the novel
metaphorical usage of motion verbs is recognised.
In the ﬁeld of the computational modelling of metaphors, Krishnaku-
maran and Zhu (2007) also pursued the identiﬁcation of novel metaphors
(deﬁned as
live
as opposed to
dead
).
However, they do not report the pro-
cedure followed in the manual annotation.
Literature is very scarce in this
respect,
with most of the studies presenting detailed annotation proce-
dures focusing on the discrimination between literal and (conventional)
metaphorical uses of linguistic items and/or expressions.
Thus, here I use
as a blueprint for the annotation procedure the manual for Metaphor Anal-
ysis in Psychotherapy (MAP) (Gelo, 2008).
In fact,
MAP provides an op-
erationalised procedure for the identiﬁcation of metaphors as built on the
works in cognitive linguistics of Kovecses (2010) for the understanding of
conventional and unconventional metaphors.
The detailed procedure pre-
sented to the two annotators is described in Appendix 1.

System

Overview of the chapter
In this chapter the systems developed for the detection of the literal
or
metaphorical use of motion verbs are described.
In Section 6.2, the main
reasons behind the choice of implementing metaphor processing models
employing unsupervised techniques and without resorting to task-speciﬁc
hand-coded linguistic resources are explained. Section 6.3 explores the de-
sign of the systems following the guidelines provided by Shutova (2015).
The main characteristics of the data on which the systems are trained and
tested and the limitations that arise in dealing with them are also dis-
cussed. The approaches at the basis of the systems and the main intuitions
guiding their development are described in Section 6.4. Section 6.5 focuses
on how the unsupervised methodologies are implemented and used for

metaphor detection.
Section 6.6 concludes the chapter describing in detail
the the algorithms of the three models.
6.2
Why a lexical resource-less approach
As previously shown in Chapter 2, metaphors represent a complex concep-
tual system involving diﬀerent layers of reasoning.
Being the metaphors
a reﬂection of our conceptual system,
speakers are not only supposed to
share a strong enough linguistic background to properly receive and pro-
cess the communicated information but they also need to draw on a similar
cultural knowledge (Lakoﬀ and Johnson, 1980, p.15).
In order to represent such a complex mechanism, during the last few
decades the NLP community have designed computational systems that
have more than often relied on the availability of large manually-annotated
resources (being them handcrafted lexical resources, ontologies, etc.).
Yet
these resources – fundamental as they are – also show some downsides.
On the one hand, they are inevitably time-consuming.
The building and
development of such highly-curated and structured repositories entails a
serious commitment that often turns their creation into a long-term project.
On the other hand, most of these resources represent an exclusive advan-
tage of a very handful of languages around the world.
Thus, even if some
intuitions may be applicable to diﬀerent-speaking contexts, the language
itself constrains the approach in its restricted realm.
Discarding precious information contained in general-domain lexical
databases – such as WordNet and FrameNet among the others – might not
represent a wise choice,
as they undoubtedly provide precious informa-
tion to better represent the complex mechanism under analysis.
However,
as Shutova (2015,
p.587) remarks,
“it would be an advantage if no such
resource is required and the system can dynamically induce meanings in
context”.
Thus, being able to develop an approach that could as far as possible
overcome the limitations posed by the use of general-domain lexical re-
6.3.
Design of the metaphor recognition system
125
sources has been one of the principal aims of the present work.
6.3
Design of
the metaphor
recognition
system
Working on the computational
modelling of
metaphors,
during recent
years Shutova (2015) has stressed the necessity of building a unifying land-
scape that could deﬁne the task at hand, the features of the developed sys-
tem, the evaluation standards and the linguistic considerations involved in
the analysis of metaphors.
Her work represents an invaluable step forward in this ﬁeld of research
as she did not only review the recent approaches proposed so far in lit-
erature but also delineated the principal properties that a metaphor pro-
cessing system should possess.
Furthermore,
as the same author under-
lines, for a model to be successful “[t]he design of the metaphor processing
task should thus be informed by the possible applications” (Shutova, 2015,
p.617).
In the light of what said so far, the design of the systems presented in
this thesis and their main characteristics are described below by keeping
in mind the guidelines illustrated by Shutova (2015):
•
Task
.
The task at hand is the one of metaphor identiﬁcation.
The
system identiﬁes every single instance of the verbs of motion as either
literal or metaphorical.
•
Linguistic considerations and level of analysis
.
As motivated in
Chapter 5, the target lexical units under analysis are the motion verbs
and the level
of analysis is the one deﬁned as
linguistic metaphor
,
namely the surface realisation of the metaphor in the text.
•
Level of conventionality
.
The system discriminates between a lit-
eral and metaphorical use of the motion verb in text.
As previously
126
Chapter 6.
A Lexical Resource-less Metaphor Recognition System
stated in 5.3.2, under the label
literal
the basic contemporary meaning
of the target lexical unit or its conventional metaphorical meaning is
included. With the label
metaphorical
I refer instead to the unconven-
tional metaphorical use of the target lexical unit.
•
Context of application
. The system operates on continuous, dialogi-
cal, naturally occurring texts from real-world data. More speciﬁcally,
the texts under analysis are represented by the opening statements
and the replies to journalists’ questions of the podium.
•
Genre and topics
.
The genre of the texts is constrained by the na-
ture of the White House Press Brieﬁngs, an atypical kind of political
discourse.
However, as shown in Chapter 4 and in Appendix 1, the
topics discussed during each brieﬁng may vary from private matters
of the incumbent president to more formal issues.
•
Knowledge
.
As motivated in Section 6.2,
the system does not rely
on either hand-coded rules or general-domain lexical resources.
As
it will be shown in Section 6.5,
the system acquires its knowledge
directly from the corpus itself.
•
Word classes and syntactic constructions
.
As previously shown in
Chapter 5, the system deals with the verb word class and more specif-
ically with a selection of motion verbs drawn from Levin’s classiﬁca-
tion. As for the syntactic construction, the system is primarily evalu-
ated on motion verbs-direct object pairs (verbs of motion in this par-
ticular syntactic relation are present at least once in each document).
As the utterance may include more than one motion verb (not nec-
essarily followed by a direct object), the system is also evaluated on
instances presenting other syntactic constructions diﬀerent from the
one above-described (cf.
Section 7.2.1 for more details).
6.3.
Design of the metaphor recognition system
127
6.3.1
A note on the syntactic constructions
The utterances to be used for the evaluation stage where chosen based on
the syntactic criterion described in the previous section.
Indeed, only doc-
uments including at least one motion verb followed by its direct object were
selected.
The instances were found by looking for
dobj
arcs with verb (
VB
)
head and noun (
NN
), proper noun (
PROPN
) or pronoun (
PRON
) depen-
dent.
The decision to focus on this particular syntactic construction was mo-
tivated by the approach to the identiﬁcation of the literal or metaphorical
usage of motion verbs.
As it will described more in detail in the next sec-
tions, based on the intuition of Shutova et al. (2016) that the linguistic word
embeddings of the verb-direct object pairs can actually capture informa-
tion about the source and target domains, the degree of similarity between
verb and direct object becomes a tool for metaphor detection, hence acting
in a certain way as a proxy for selectional preference violation.
Although the initial intention was to also include subject-motion verb
pairs in order to provide more information for the metaphorical detection
and extend the number of data to be investigated,
this option was dis-
carded.
Indeed, due to the dialogical nature of the press brieﬁngs, speak-
ers’ utterances are characterised by a high number of anaphoras that makes
hard their resolution, since their reference may sometimes lie in the jour-
nalists’ questions.
Furthermore, due to the presence of a high number of
complex syntactic structures such as open clausal complements and rela-
tive clause modiﬁers,
the retrieval of the correct subject would have rep-
resented a task on its own, since most of the time requiring the resolution
of its reference.

The Approaches
The approaches adopted in the development of the metaphor process-
ing system presented in this dissertation are inspired by the works of
Sporleder and Li
(2009),
Beigman Klebanov et al.
(2009),
Shutova et al.
(2016) and grounded in the pioneering study on cohesion by Halliday and
Hasan (1976). The two approaches are described in Paragraph 6.4.0.0.1 and
6.4.0.0.2.
6.4.
The Approaches
129
6.4.0.0.1
First approach
The ﬁrst approach is deﬁned as
global
and can
be described as
syntax-agnostic
since only the context of appearance of the
target motion verb is leveraged as feature for the detection of its literal or
metaphorical use, hence without using any syntactic information. This ap-
proach is guided by the work of Sporleder and Li (2009, p.754) since sug-
gesting that the potential metaphorical meaning of an expression can be
inferred from the discourse context (although the approach of Sporleder
and Li (2009) is more detailed focusing on cohesive ties with the surround-
ing discourse and not talking of metaphoricity but of literal or non-literal
meaning).
More precisely,
supposing a text to be lexically coherent,
the
target motion verb should ﬁguratively break this coherence when used
metaphorically.
When literally used instead,
the lexical coherence of the
text should be preserved.
Using the words of Halliday and Hasan (1976,
p.18) and Morris and Hirst (1991, p.21), the notion of cohesion is deﬁned
here as “the set of possibilities that exist in language for making the text
hang together”, since it “is not a guarantee of unity in text but rather a de-
vice for creating it”.
A group of sentences and phrases acting together as
whole constitutes a cohesive text; if the group of sentences and phrases also
describe the same topic then the text can be considered coherent too.
The
lexical cohesion
is then “the cohesion that arises from semantic relationships
between words” (Morris and Hirst, 1991) and also a strong clue of coher-
ence in text.
In a nutshell, using this ﬁrst approach, a potential metaphor-
ical expression should be detected as such if not semantically related with
the words describing the topic(s) of conversation.
Previous approaches to the detection of literal or non-literal expres-
sions have indeed considered lexical
coherence as cue for metaphorical
detection.
In particular,
as also discussed in Section 3.5.3,
Sporleder and
Li (2009) proposed a token-based unsupervised method identifying
lexical
chains
as a cue for the detection of idiomaticity in text. Two cohesion-based
classiﬁers were experimented, one computing lexical chains in text and the
other one building a cohesion graph. Furthermore, working on a large cor-
pus of media discourse documents,
Beigman Klebanov et al.
(2009) suc-
130
Chapter 6.
A Lexical Resource-less Metaphor Recognition System
cessfully hypothesised that words coherently representing the topic under
discussion are less likely to be used metaphorically, then suggesting that
the metaphors might be found in words “breaking” the lexical coherence
of a text.
6.4.0.0.2
Second approach
Inspired by the work of Shutova et al. (2016),
the second approach takes a closer look to the syntactic information around
the target motion verb, only when a verb-direct object relation is in place.
For this reasons it is deﬁned as
local
.
The hypothesis is that a low semantic
similarity observed between the verb and its direct object should hint at the
presence of a metaphor in text.
In this case, the verb and its direct object
belong to two diﬀerent conceptual domains.
The choice of selecting only
the verb-direct object relations is motivated by the inherent characteristics
of the context of application, as discussed in Section 6.3.1.
6.5
The Method
6.5.1
Intro
The hypothesis presented in this dissertation suggests that when the tar-
get motion verb is lexically incoherent with the surrounding context, it may
represent an indicator of metaphoricity.
The context of appearance of the
target motion verb – i.e.
the utterance of the podium – is considered as the
whole text representing either a statement or a reply to journalists’ ques-
tions by the podium.
Let us take a look at the example (23). It is 1996 and the incumbent pres-
ident of U.S. is Bill Clinton.
The topic at hand is foreign policy and more
precisely the peace negotiations in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian con-
ﬂict. White House Press Secretary Michael Curry has just handed over to a
senior administrator oﬃcial with a more in-depth knowledge of the recent
developments in the meetings between Arafat and Netanyahu. Answering
6.5.
The Method
131
a question coming from a journalist regarding the role of the United States
in the peace talks, the senior administrator oﬃcial replies by saying:
(23)
“Well, ﬁrst, they’ve got enough that they have to resolve between them in terms of the
implementation, the remaining issues of the implementation of the Interim Agreement.
And I feel that, in fact, once you cross the threshold of having worked out agreements you
will begin to change the landscape between them.
It will begin to further change their
attitudes not only about each other,
but about what their relationship [pause] I don’t
mean individually, I mean people [pause] is going to be.”
Detecting the metaphorical use of the verb
cross
in this excerpt seems
to be a reasoning not hard at all for us humans, notwithstanding the com-
plex linguistic structure of the sentence itself.
For starters, the ability to to
process the referential ambiguity of the pronoun
you
might be taken for
granted but it is not trivial at all.
Indeed, we can only understand that it
refers to the potential interference of the U.S. in the negotiation talks only
looking at the question uttered by the journalist.
But then, how do we re-
alise that the verb
cross
is used metaphorically? Maybe we recognise the
degree of abstractness of the direct object
threshold
and understand that it
does not refer to a physical object but to a concept “distant from immedi-
ate perception”(Turney et al., 2011).
Maybe having recognised the abstract
property of the term
threshold
, our lexical knowledge tells us that the verb
cross
is then used metaphorically since violating selectional restrictions and
making
threshold
standing out as a semantically incompatible argument.
No matter which reasoning helps us process this information, we hu-
mans can successfully carry out such a complex linguistic task in a very
limited short time – instantly and eﬀectively – and the key ingredient of
this process seems to lie in our linguistic knowledge. A question then arises
from this depicted scenario:
How can we teach a machine to recognise metaphors when no lexical
knowledge has been made available to it?

6.5.2
Modelling machine knowledge using word embeddings
As previously stated,
the metaphor processing system developed in this
thesis does not rely on any lexical resource. Indeed, the
linguistic knowledge
of the system comes directly from the corpus itself, in the shape of the so-
called
word emebeddings
.
As ﬁrst step, the words dense vector representations known as
word em-
beddings
were learnt employing Word2Vec model, since proved to success-
fully encode the semantic meaning of words in each vector (Mikolov et al.,
2013b).
To carry out this task,
the Python implementation of Word2Vec
provided by the Gensim (Rehurek and Sojka, 2010) library
2
was used.
The skip-gram model with negative sampling was chosen.
This tech-
nique indeed learns ﬁne-grained word representations when trained on
large collection of data (Mikolov et al., 2013c). The number of ‘noise words’
to be drawn was ﬁxed at 10.
The threshold for random downsample of
high-frequency words was set to
1
e
-3 in order to improve word embed-
dings quality (Mikolov et al.,
2013c).
Furthermore,
Goldberg and Levy
(2014) point out that sub-sampling and rare-pruning seem to increase the
eﬀective size of the window, in this way making the similiarities more top-
ical.
The dimensionality of the feature vector was ﬁxed at 100 while the
size of the symmetric window to 5.
The embeddings were trained on a linguistic pre-processed version of
the CompWHoB Corpus for 5 epochs. The texts were indeed pre-processed
using SpaCy.
Each token is represented by its lemmatised form plus its
POS-tag according to the Google Universal
POS tag set
3
in the format
lemma|POS
, in order to distinguish between homographs words with dif-
ferent POS (e.g.
“I
run
home”, “They are on the
run
”).
Finally, the choice of training the system on the CompWHoB Corpus is
motivated by the will to focus on the atypical genre, the speciﬁc dialogical
nature of texts and the use of language made in the U.S. press brieﬁngs.

The Method
133
6.5.3
Modelling context using LDA
As said in Section 6.4, the intuition behind the approach is to leverage the
context of appearance of the target motion verb for the detection of the
metaphorical or literal use.
The context is deﬁned by the sentence includ-
ing the target motion verb and the sentences preceding and following it (if
any). More formally, the target motion verb is deﬁned as
mot
_
verb
. A doc-
ument
d
is under analysis if it includes the sentence containing
mot
_
verb
,
deﬁned as
s
t
. The context consists of
s
t
and the
N
sentences preceding and
following
s
t
.
Coming back to the example (23), the context is in this case
formally represented as
1
N
+
s
t
+ 1
N
.
Thus, the context of appearance of the target motion verb is modelled
using topic modelling, in particular employing the LDA generative proba-
bilistic model.
This technique was also implemented in Python using the
LDA module
4
provided by Gensim.
Prior to the training of the LDA model, a linguistic pre-processing step
was carried out.
In order to generate topics semantically meaningful, only
lemmas tagged as nouns were kept,
according to the format
lemma|POS
previously introduced in Section 6.5.2.
Furthermore,
lemmas that
ap-
peared in less than 1000 documents or more than 30% documents were
discarded. The
ad-hoc
stoplist developed by Esposito et al. (2016) was used
to further ﬁlter the data since taking into account the main features of the
linguistic genre at hand.
The stoplist includes indeed all personal and in-
deﬁnite pronouns as well as the most commonly used honoriﬁcs since of-
ten used in addressing the podium. The ﬁrst names of the press secretaries
in oﬃce during the period of time covered by the corpus are also part of
the stoplist as most of the time used only as nouns of address (Brown and
Gilman, 1960).
After having completed the linguistic pre-processing step,
the LDA
model was run on the training corpus employing the online variational
Bayes (VB) algorithm (Hoﬀman et al., 2010).
In fact, being based on online

A Lexical Resource-less Metaphor Recognition System
stochastic optimisation with a natural gradient step, the LDA online suc-
ceeds in converging to a local optimum of the VB objective function.
The
number of latent topics to be extracted from the training corpus was set
to 50.
The model was updated every 150 documents giving one pass over
the corpus and setting at 70 the maximum number of iterations for topic
convergence.
Once the LDA model estimation stage was complete,
topic
distribution inference was run on the unseen data.

Discriminating between literal and
metaphorical meaning
In this section, the metaphor recognition systems implemented for the the
detection of the literal or metaphorical use of motion verbs are described.
Three diﬀerent models were developed to investigate the performance of
the system on this task.
The ﬁrst model leverages only the information contained in the context
of appearance of the motion verb, i.e.
the podium’s utterance.
The second
model adds a new feature since taking also into account the syntactic infor-
mation of the verb-direct object pairs.
The third model combines the two
previously described approaches to investigate if the LDA system can in-
form the syntactic pair relation and improve the ﬁnal overall performance.
6.6.1
Literal or Metaphorical
The discrimination between literal
and metaphorical
use of the motion
verbs is interpreted as an (unsupervised) binary classiﬁcation task.
In or-
der to identify the behaviour of the target unit, two thresholds were deter-
mined for the scores of the
global
and
local
approaches respectively.
Clas-
siﬁcation thresholds for the three models were optimised maximising the
F-score on a small annotated development set.
In the case of the models
combining the
global
and
local
approaches, the thresholds were considered
6.6.
Discriminating between literal and
metaphorical meaning
135
as dependent variables and determined accordingly.
As for the ﬁnal clas-
siﬁcation step, the target motion verbs with values above the set threshold
were categorised as literal while those with values below the threshold
were considered to be used metaphorically.
6.6.2
Global model
The ﬁrst model developed has been deﬁned as
global
since it only uses the
information provided by the wide context of appearance of the motion
verb, without leveraging the syntactic structure of the sentence. More pre-
cisely, the model employs the output of the topic inference on documents
– i.e.
a distribution of words – and the corresponding word embeddings
generated by applying Word2Vec on the training corpus.
Indeed, LDA de-
scribes each document
d
as a multinomial distribution over topics where
each topic is deﬁned as multinomial
distribution over words in a ﬁxed
vocabulary.
The hypothesis suggested here is that comparing the vector
representation of the motion verb
mot
_
verb
with the embedding of each
word forming part of the topic representing the document
d
, it is possible
to recognise the literal or metaphorical use of
mot
_
verb
.
The assumption
is that the multinomial distribution over words describe a coherent topic.
Ergo, if the motion verb embedding shows a low semantic relatedness with
each of the vector representations of the words in the topic, its use is cate-
gorised as metaphoric since
breaking
the lexical cohesion of the document.
The semantic relatedness between the individual word representations is
measured using cosine similarity.
Let us deﬁne as
T
the list of topics returned by the topic-inference stage
on the unseen document
d
and
t
n
as the
n
th word embedding generated
by the Word2Vec model (a lemma POS-tagged as noun according to the
lemma|POS
format) in
T
, cosine similarity is then deﬁned as:
cos
_
sim
(
v
i
, t
n
)
(6.1)
136
Chapter 6.
A Lexical Resource-less Metaphor Recognition System
where
v
i
is the
i
th vector representation of the target motion verb under
analysis in
d
.
Cosine similarity is formally computed as:
cos
(
x, y
) =
x
·
y
||
x
||||
y
||
(6.2)
Algorithm 1 in Appendix C describes the procedure devised for the
recognition of either a literal or metaphorical use of the target motion verb.
It can be divided in two main blocks:
1.
Given the word embedding of
i
th motion verb
mot
_
verb
in a docu-
ment
d
,
the algorithm ﬁrst computes the cosine similarity between
v
i
and the
t
n
in
T
.
Every similarity score is then appended to the list
C
v
i
.
2.
Every similarity score in
C
v
i
is then compared to the threshold pre-
viously deﬁned on the development set.
If every similarity score
in
C
v
i
is below the threshold of the model, then
v
i
is recognised as
metaphorical.
Otherwise, if just one of the similarity scores is above
the threshold, then
v
i
is categorised as literal.
6.6.3
Glo-cal model
The second model is named after the combination of the previously de-
scribed
global
approach and the focus on the
local
syntactic relation of the
target motion verb with its direct object.
As stated in Section 6.4,
the
attention on the local
context is inspired by the work of Shutova et al.
(2016) on the hypothesis that if two linguistic units belong to two diﬀerent
conceptual domains, a low semantic similarity should be observed and a
metaphorical use should be detected.
Thus, the local context is considered as the syntactic relation between
the target verb of motion and its direct object.
As proposed by Shutova
6.6.
Discriminating between literal and
metaphorical meaning
137
et al. (2016), cosine similarity is used to measure the semantic relatedness
of the syntactic pair:
sim
(
v
i
, dobj
i
)
where
v
i
is the
i
th target motion verb word embedding under analysis
in a document
d
and
dobj
i
is the
i
th vector representation of the direct
object whose head is
v
i
.
As shown in Section 6.6.2, semantic relatedness is
measured using Formula 6.2.
Thus,
the
glo-cal
model
separately combines the
global
method with
the syntactic
local
approach.
More precisely,
if the target
motion verb
mot
_
verb
i
does not have a direct object, then the
glo-cal
model operates us-
ing the
global
procedure. If a verb-direct object relation is instead detected,
the system then computes the cosine similarity between
v
i
and
dobj
i
. If the
similarity score is above the set threshold, then the meaning is labelled as
literal.
Otherwise, the use of
mot
_
verb
i
is recognised as metaphorical.
The Algorithm 2 in Appendix C shows how the
glo-cal
model identiﬁes
the literal or metaphorical meaning of the target motion verb.
It can be
divided into three steps:
1.
The
FindDirObj
runs through the text looking for the motion of verb
and its possible direct object in the document
d
.
d
is parsed using
SpaCy dependency parser.
2.
If
FindDirObj
ﬁnds the
mot
_
verb
i
without a direct object,
then the
system proceeds as in the
global
algorithm and measuring similarity
according to the
global
threshold.
3.
If
FindDirObj
successfully returns the verb-direct object pair, then the
system measure the semantic relatedness between
v
i
and
dobj
i
. If the
similarity score is above the
glo-cal
threshold,
mot
_
verb
i
is identiﬁed
as literal.
Otherwise, its meaning is recognised as metaphorical.

Glo-cal weighted model
The third and last model developed in this thesis combines again the
global
and
local
procedures in one algorithm.
Diﬀerently from the
glo-cal
ap-
proach,
this system uses the output generated from the
global
model to
inform the
local
strategy.
More precisely, the
glo-cal weighted
model applies
the
global
approach to the instances of the target verbs of motion having a
direct object.
The model then moves on to the
local
procedure described in
6.6.3 and on the basis of the resulting label assigned by the
global
algorithm
block,
a weight is added or subtracted to the ﬁnal semantic relatedness
measurement.
The Algorithm 3 in Appendix C describes in detail the devised proce-
dure.
It consists of four main steps:
1.
The
FindDirObj
runs through the text looking for the motion of verb
and its possible direct object in the document
d
.
d
is parsed using
SpaCy dependency parser.
2.
If
FindDirObj
does not ﬁnd a verb-direct object syntactic relation,
mot
_
verb
i
literal or metaphorical meaning is then identiﬁed using
the
global
approach
3.
If
FindDirObj
does ﬁnd a verb-direct object syntactic relation,
the
global
algorithm block is ﬁrst applied
4.
According to the resulting output of the
global
algorithm,
a weight
is added or subtracted in the subsequent semantic relatedness mea-
surement of the
v
i
and
dobj
i
.
If the similarity score is below the
glo-
cal
threshold, the use of
mot
_
verb
i
is then categorised as metaphori-
cal.
On the contrary, if it is above the
glo-cal
threshold, the algorithm
identiﬁes the use as literal.

Evaluation of the system:
results and discussions
7.1
Overview of the chapter
In this chapter the evaluation of the metaphor recognition systems is pre-
sented.
Section 7.2 illustrates the dataset used for the training and testing
of the three models. Section 7.3 describes the evaluation metrics employed
for measuring systems’ eﬀectiveness.
The baseline set for models perfor-
mance comparison is discussed in Section 7.4.
The results of each of the
three models are reported and analysed both quantitatively and qualita-
tively in Section 7.5.
Finally,
overall performance on metaphor detection
task is discussed in Section 7.6.
7.2
Dataset
The dataset employed in the evaluation of the metaphor recognition sys-
tems was built from the CompWHoB corpus. As discussed in Section 5.2.3,
139
140
Chapter 7.
Evaluation of the system:
results and discussions
data were randomly selected only from podium’s utterances and split into
training, development and test set.
The training set represents the largest part of the dataset and was used
to learn the 100-dimensional word embeddings and train the LDA model
subsequently employed for the topic inference step.
Unseen
data were used
for the building of development and test sets.
The development set is a
small
collection of podium’s utterances annotated by the author of this
work according to the literal or metaphorical distinction described in Sec-
tion 5.3.2, employed for tuning the parameters of the systems (e.g. number
of inferred topics for each document, negative and positive weights, etc.)
and determining the optimal classiﬁcation thresholds for the
global
and
lo-
cal
approaches (cf.
Section 6.6.1).
In order to be representative of the test
set, at least one instance of each motion verb included in the selection de-
scribed in Section 5.2.5 is present in the development set.
7.2.1
Test set
The test set on which the system was evaluated is represented by the ut-
terances used for the annotation task introduced in Section 5.3.2.
Since the
main syntactic focus of investigation is represented by motion verb-direct
object pairs, documents collected for the building of the test set
primarily
meet this criterion.
The reason I highlight here the adverb
primarily
is due
to the nature of the document itself.
In fact, when retrieving the whole ut-
terance, more than one motion verb may be included in it, moreover possi-
bly not showing the particular syntactic construction.
Thus, although the
initial intention was to equally distribute the number of instances of the
selected motion verbs in the test set, some verbs tend inevitably to
prevail
over the others due to their frequent use in the atypical political genre of
U.S. press brieﬁngs. Furthermore, the higher frequencies of some verbs can
be explained by either the
reticence
of some motion verbs to take a direct
object in this particular genre or their subcategorisation restrictions.
As described in Section 5.3.2,
in annotating the podium’s utterances
of the test set,
human judges were asked to identify the unconventional

metaphorical
use of the selected motion verbs,
as opposed to their lit-
eral
or conventional
metaphorical
use.
They were provided with three
labelling options:
MTP
for metaphorical
use of the verb,
LTR
for the lit-
eral/conventional metaphorical one and
UNK
whereby it was not possible
to identify the reading as either literal or metaphorical.
Inter-annotator
agreement was in this case measured using Cohen’s kappa Cohen (1960),
yielding
κ
= 0
.

(
n
= 2
, N
= 1221
, k
= 3
), where
n
is the number of an-
notators,
N
the number of annotated instances and
k
the labels available
for annotation.
One source of disagreement between annotators can be
tracked down
to
the interpretation of metaphorical conventionality, as boundaries between
novel and conventional metaphors may appear sometimes very fuzzy. Fur-
thermore, one needs to take into account also the atypical political genre of
the U.S. press brieﬁngs and the corresponding use of language made by its
main characters, i.e.
the podium(s).
Diﬀerences in annotations stem also
from the limited context in which some motion verbs are
placed
.
Indeed,
being it hard to fully comprehend the general meaning of the utterance –
i.e.
the topic of conversation – due to the restricted context (it may consist
of just one sentence, the one including the target verb instance), the iden-
tiﬁcation of the metaphorical or literal use of the motion verb may depend
on this uncertain interpretation.
Finally, a certain percentage of disagree-
ment may lie in the very annotation procedure framework since leaving in
the end a signiﬁcant room for subjective judgement, notwithstanding the
structured sequential instructions annotators were provided with.
The system was evaluated only on the instances which both the anno-
tators could agree on.
1147 motion verbs were indeed included in the test
set.
From the total number, 40 were the instances discarded during eval-
uation since wrongly POS-tagged by the SpaCy parser (mostly adjectives
labelled as verbs), leading to a ﬁnal number of 1107 instances and 488 doc-
uments.

the motion verbs and their literal and/or metaphorical reading.
Figure 7.1|Distribution of
motion verbs in the test set and the corresponding
literal and/or metaphorical reading.
As regards the annotations,
the test set turned out to be highly un-
balanced.
Indeed,
only 60 are the instances of motion verbs tagged as
metaphorical, while the remaining 1047 were interpreted as either literal
or conventional metaphorical. Metaphors are evenly distributed across the
test set, showing this trend not to be determined by the random selection of
podium’s utterances.
Although the test set is too small to draw deﬁnitive
conclusions, this result might indicate that the sample represents a reﬂec-
tion of motion verbs metaphoricity across the CompWHoB corpus.
As regards the syntactic focus of analysis,
738 are the verb-direct ob-
ject pairs investigated while 369 are the motion verbs in diﬀerent syntactic
relations.
The largest part of metaphorical motion verbs distributes across

Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation metrics reported in this work follow the measures indi-
cated by Sebastiani
(2002) for categorisation eﬀectiveness.
Considering
the method proposed here as a two-class classiﬁer,
macroaverage
is used
for evaluation, in order to give equal weight to each class.
Microaverage
is
not taken into account because yielding the same score as accuracy.
The
four metrics employed for the evaluation of the system eﬀectiveness are
the following:
•
Accuracy
:
Accuracy is the number of the motion verbs correctly
identiﬁed as either literal or metaphorical given the total number of
instances.
•
Precision
:
Precision is considered as the number of the correctly
identiﬁed motion verbs given all the instances assigned by the model
to that particular class.
Macroprecision is computed as the average

of the two precision scores (i.e.
literal and metaphorical precisions).
Hereafter, with the term ‘precision’ I refer to macroprecision.
•
Recall
:
Recall is considered as the number of correctly identiﬁed in-
stances given all the instances of that particular class present in the
test set (i.e.
the total number of gold-standard annotations for that
speciﬁc class).
Macrorecall is computed as the average of the two re-
call scores (i.e.
literal and metaphorical recalls).
Hereafter, with the
term ‘recall’ I refer to macrorecall.

F-score
:
F-score is the harmonic measure of the
globally
computed
precision and recall.
In this case, with F-score I refer to the macro-F-
score measure, i.e.

Evaluation baseline
Although previous approaches focused on verbal targets including also
frames of motion (Gedigian et al., 2006), ﬁnding datasets manually anno-
tated for metaphoricity featuring a high number of occurrences of mo-
tion verbs is not an easy task.
Even when such resources are available
(Steen et
al.,
2010),
the large training required by the LDA model
for
the inference of optimal topics represents a serious limitation in the def-
inition of an external
baseline.
Furthermore,
to the best of my knowl-
edge,
the metaphor processing model introduced in this work is among
the few ones to present unsupervised techniques for the identiﬁcation of
motion verbs metaphoricity in naturally-occurring, dialogical continuous
texts from real-world data.
Thus, due to the lack of resources annotated for novel metaphors also
providing large contexts for LDA topic inference and due to the highly un-
balanced nature of the test set, the
global
model was chosen as baseline of

Analysis of results
In this section,
the results of the three models on the metaphor identiﬁ-
cation task are discussed.
After showing the performance comparison of
the three systems in Section 7.5.1, each model is then analysed separately.
In order to discuss results both in quantitative and qualitative terms, 7 ut-
terances including motion verb instances are analysed to evaluate how the
model performs in recognising novel metaphorical use when the linguis-
tic structure inﬂuences its interpretation.
More precisely, 7 documents are

randomly chosen based on Dunn (2013b)’s deﬁnition of
saturated
and
un-
saturated
utterances (cf.
Section 2.4) and labelled as metaphorical by anno-
tators.
An utterance is deﬁned as unsaturated when it contains elements
from both the source and target domains. On the contrary, it is categorised
as saturated if it only includes elements from the target domain, making it
reading either entirely metaphorical or non-metaphorical.
In some cases, the 7 selected utterances are reported here without their
wide context, due to space limitations.

After having analysed the performance of each model, the major chal-
lenging issues to be handled by the models are described in Section 7.5.5.
Finally, the overall results are discussed in Section 7.6.

Performance models comparison
In this section,
the performance of the each model evaluated against the
manually annotated test data are presented.
Table 7.2 shows the results of
the system in recognising the literal or metaphorical use of motion verbs
according to the metrics described in Section 7.3.
Thus,
precision,

The overall
performance of the system is represented by the

of the three metrics.
The accuracy of the model is also re-
ported here,

7.5.2
Global model analysis
As described in Section 6.6.2, the
global
model uses as information for the
detection of the literal or metaphorical use of motion verbs only their wide
context of appearance, i.e.
the whole utterance including it.
In a nutshell,
it is the degree of similarity between the LDA topic terms describing the
document and the motion verb itself to deﬁne its reading.
Taking a look at the results in Table 7.2, the common thread running
through the three models is represented by the higher recall when com-
pared to the attained precision.
This trend is also revealed in the
global
system.
As it can be observed, the reason for this signiﬁcant diﬀerence is to be
found in the performance of the model described by the
G
m
rates. Indeed,
the
global
model successfully identiﬁes more than half of the metaphor-
ical instances in the test set (32 out of the annotated 60).
However,
the
high number of metaphorical false positives results in an inevitably low
metaphorical precision.
On the contrary, performance on the literal detection of motion verbs
usages results in high scores in precision, with 798 occurrences out of the
total 1047 correctly identiﬁed by the system.
In Figure 7.2
2
, the plot of the
confusion matrix for the
global
system can be observed.
Having a closer look at the syntactic context of the motion verbs, the
global
system identiﬁes the 54.90% of the instances presenting a verb-direct
object dependency relation and the 44.44% of those not presenting the par-
ticular syntactic structure under analysis.
When dealing with verb-object
pairs,
the model
tends to return a major number false positives among
metaphors (
F P
= 141
) if compared to the instances not presenting the

particular syntactic constructions (
F P
= 108
).
However, one must bear in
mind that only 9 are the motion verbs tagged as metaphorical not having a
speciﬁc syntactic focus, as Table 7.1 shows.
Looking at the performance of
the model on the literal detection, the
global
system correctly identiﬁes the
79.47% of the transitive motion verbs and the 70% of the ones not having a
direct object.
As regards the performance in recognising the metaphoricity of motion
verbs in saturated utterances, the system correctly identiﬁes as metaphori-
cal the instance in (25), where the
train leaving the station
stands metaphor-
ically for an opportunity not to be missed out by the country.
Despite the
wide context surrounding the motion verb in (26),
the information pro-
vided by the topics assigned to the utterance does not lead the system to
tag the instance as metaphorical.
The metaphorical expression in (24) is
also wrongly labelled as literal, but in this case the context of the motion

Analysis of results

verb is represented by just the sentence including it (if not considering the
few not very informative words included in the following sentence), hence
making the topic inference on the utterance less reliable.
When dealing with the unsaturated examples shown in Section 7.5, the
global
model correctly identiﬁes the metaphorical value of 2 out of 4 in-
stances.
In both (27) and (29) foreign aﬀairs topics are discussed by the
podium and in both utterances the metaphoricity of the corresponding
verbs – i.e.
turn
and
escape
– is detected by the system.
The system fails
in (28) probably mislead by the expression
enter oﬃce
, very common in the
political genre.
The same reason can be hypothesised to be the cause of
the wrong classiﬁcation in (30), since
lead
plays a major role in the lexicon
being used by the podium in the various topics.
Interesting results are also reported in the evaluation of conventional
metaphorical use of motion verbs.
In working on idioms such as
turn the
corner
and
fall
far of
(something)
,
the system fails since labelling them as
metaphorical in (31) and (32). On the contrary, in (33) the
global
model cor-
rectly detects as literal both the motion verbs, namely
roll
and
turn
. In these
cases, it is hard to understand why the system returns such results.

, namely leveraging LDA topics for metaphor detection.
Motion verb-direct object pairs are instead
handled
with a

approach,
using the degree of similarity between verb and object to determine the
instance metaphoricity.
Results displayed in Table 7.2 show that adding to the system
local
fea-
tures actually improves its performance,
hence conﬁrming Shutova et al.
(2016)’s intuition that linguistic embeddings can capture information of
the target and source domains.

If precision does not

glo-cal
model correctly identiﬁes 47 motion verbs as metaphorical.
The best performance is reached in the
local
syntactic context,
where
44 are the metaphors detected out of the 51 followed by a direct object.
Increasing the instances recognised as metaphorical, the
glo-cal
system in-
evitably brings down the recall on the literal detection, reaching on the con-
trary a high precision of 0.97.
The model performs better in detecting the
literal use of motion verbs not acting as transitively, identifying the 90.83%
of the instances correctly,
while only the 43.81% of those in the syntactic
context under investigation.
Looking at the performance of the system in dealing with saturated ut-
terances, the
glo-cal
model correctly identiﬁes the metaphorical use of each
instance in the examples here investigated.
In (24), (25) and (26) the three
motion verbs present the verb-direct object relation, namely the syntactic
construction where the model reaches its highest performance. Metaphor-
ical use is also correctly detected in three of the four saturated utterances.
In (27), (28) and (29) the running syntactic common thread is indeed rep-
resented by the
local
dependency relation under analysis.
Instead, in (30),
where

due to the absence of the direct object,

7.5.4
Glo-cal weighted model analysis
The
glo-cal
weighted
system uses the framework developed in the
glo-cal
model
but this time leveraging the output returned from the
global
ap-
proach to inform the
local
one. In a nutshell, working on motion verb-direct
object pairs, the
glo-cal weighted
model ﬁrst measures the similarity between
the verb instance and the utterance’s topic and then uses its output as a
weight applied to the
local
procedure for metaphorical detection.
The hy-
pothesis to be tested here is that the combination of the document’s topic
and local syntactic context can help in the successful detection of motion
verb use.
Looking at the overall scores in Table 7.2,
it can be observed that the
performance of the
glo-cal weighted
model slightly improves compared to
the
glo-cal
system, attaining an F-score of 0.61.
Even if precision and recall
turn out to be ﬁxed at 0.54 and 0.69 respectively, attention must be paid to
the
G
m
and
G
l
scores to fully comprehend the performance of the system.
The
glo-cal weighted
model successfully identiﬁes 38 instances as meta-
phorical, almost ten less than the total number reached by the
glocal
sys-
tem.
On the sub-metaphorical task,
recall is indeed driven down to 0.63
and precision slightly improved,
yielding an F-score of 0.21,
higher than
those of the
global
and
glo-cal
models.
This is explained by the consider-
able reduction in the number of false positives returned by the system.
More precisely 262 are the instances labelled as metaphorical by the
glo-cal
weighted
model, with the
glo-cal
system reaching the 419 units.
Again, the system attains an higher performance in recognising meta-
phors in the
local
syntactic context, where 35 are the instances correctly la-
belled out of the 51 presenting the particular dependency relation.
How-
ever,
this is not a surprise since both the
glocal
and the
glo-cal
weighted
model employs the same threshold for the
global
approach.
On the con-

trary, higher performance is reported in the successful detection of literal
motion verbs.
Indeed, looking at the confusion matrix plot in Figure 7.4

G
l
scores display a signiﬁcant jump in terms of recall and (inevitably) F-
score in comparison with the
glo-cal
model, however not topping the high-
est score of the
global
system.
In fact, 66.66% of the
local
motion verbs and,
again, 90.83% of instances not followed by a direct object are correctly iden-
tiﬁed.

The hurdles in metaphor recognition
Unlike many of the previous works present in literature, characterised by
the use of cherry-picked examples for the testing of the metaphorical recog-
nition system at hand, in this thesis the utterances on which the three de-
veloped models are tested represent actual real-world data.
Although the
selection of podium’s documents included in the test set is based on lexical
and syntactic criteria, the
chosen
examples represent indeed real-world dis-
course, continuous texts characterised by a dialogical nature.
In fact, each
utterance is most of the times a reply to the question posed by the jour-
nalists, hence transcriptions of spoken dialogues where the podium shows
quick thinking and conﬁdence as well as hesitation and caution. The mood
of the podium is revealed not only by their uttered words but also by the
non-verbal events they display in conversation,
such as the voluntary or
7.5.
Analysis of results
157
involuntary pauses they take. The analysis of these utterances becomes in-
evitably harder as the syntactic
holes
in structure of a sentence may prove.
Thus, in this section the main issues that negatively inﬂuenced the de-
tection of the literal or metaphorical use of motion verbs are discussed.
7.5.5.1
Restricted context
As already discussed in Section 2.4, sometimes the full metaphorical
power
of a linguistic expression can only be ascertained looking at the wide con-
text of appearance.
This is the case of saturated utterances, which can be
either entirely metaphorical or non-metaphorical. One of the features used
by the models to determine the literal or metaphorical usage of the instance
under analysis are the topics inferred by the LDA model.
For these topics
to be reliable, it is necessary for the system to work on documents of large
dimension.
However, due to the nature of the press brieﬁngs, sometimes
this is not possible. This is the case of (24), where the
global
approach is not
able to correctly detect the use of the motion verb, unlikely the
local
-based
ones.
Thus, the absence of a verb-direct object pairs and the narrow con-
text of appearance of the instance under analysis may seriously inﬂuence
the successful outcome of the recognition.
7.5.5.2
Ambiguous pronouns
Unlike the
syntax-agnostic global
approach, in verb-direct object pairs pro-
nouns play a major role for the correct
identiﬁcation of
the literal
or
metaphorical use of the motion verb.
Let us take as way of example the
following sentence:
(34)
And with that, I will
turn it
over to Secretary Johnson to begin.
In (34), we are not able to understand what the podium is turning over
to Secretary Johnson,
hence not even able to identify the use of
turn
as
either metaphorical or literal.
The only way to fully comprehend the ut-
terance itself is to go back to the preceding sentences and ﬁnd what the
158
Chapter 7.
Evaluation of the system:
results and discussions
pronoun
it
is making reference to. We would then ﬁgure out that what the
podium was turning over to the Secretary Johnson was actually a call, as
the preceding sentence of (34) describes:
(35)
We’ll do this call on the record,
but it will be embargoed until the
conclusion, so we ask that you please not use this material until the
call concludes.
However,
due to the linguistic characteristics of the U.S.
Press Brief-
ings, the application of a well-performing anaphora resolution would have
probably represented a separate task on its own.
Furthermore,
being
the brieﬁngs actually a series of question-answer between journalists and
podium, it is sometimes impossible to retrieve the reference of the pronoun
in the podium’s utterance without going back to the question posed by the
journalists themselves.
7.5.5.3
Parser issues
As the
local
approach focuses on motion verbs in verb-direct object rela-
tions, the
glo-cal
and
glo-cal weighted
models are highly dependent on the
accuracy reached by the parser.
In this case, the main hurdles are repre-
sented by:
1.
anomalous syntactic constructions;
2.
the use of an informal register between speakers.
The ﬁrst point is often caused by non-verbal events (e.g. pauses, laugh-
ter, etc.) and sudden disruptions in discourse that inevitably leads to
miss
the correct identiﬁcation of the dependency relations of the instance un-
der analysis.
Point 2 usually leads to a wrongly POS-tag of the motion
verb, due to the use of a lexicon not present in the parser database.
7.6.
Summing up the results
159
7.6
Summing up the results
In the previous sections, the models developed for the task of the metaphor
recognition of motion verbs have been discussed.
The baseline of evalua-
tion is represented by the
global
model, since taking into account a smaller
number of features compared with the other two systems.
As it can be ob-
served in Table 7.2, both the
glo-cal
and the
glo-cal weighted
models outper-
form the baseline system.
In particular, the
glo-cal weighted
system attains
the highest F-score of 0.61, which makes it the best-performing among the
three strategies presented here.
The thread connecting the three models is represented by the presence
of a modest high recall and a low precision, inevitably determined by the
unbalanced test set.
As regards the latter, the main reason is to be found
in the very restricted number of novel metaphors in the test set and by the
too high percentage of metaphor false positives returned by the systems.
On the contrary, precision in the detection of literal use of motion verbs is
reported in high scores that do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between one model
and the other.
The analysis of recall score has revealed diﬀerent trends among the sys-
tems. Although the
glo-cal
and
glo-cal weighted
models attain similar overall
scores, they do
behave
diﬀerently.
Indeed, the
glo-cal
system outperforms
the other models in terms of
G
m
recall since retrieving the largest num-
ber of metaphors.
On the contrary, the
glo-cal weighted
and
global
models
tend to favour recall in literal detection, with the latter yielding the highest
number of true positives. However, it is the
glo-cal weighted
system to attain
the highest F-score, hence showing more balance in metaphor detection.
As regards the particular syntactic constructions under investigation
in this work,
it can be observed that focusing speciﬁcally on verb-direct
object pairs actually improves the performance of the models in the detec-
tion of the metaphorical instances.
Indeed, the
glo-cal
model successfully
identiﬁes 44 metaphorical motion verbs showing the particular syntactic
construction.
The result is more modest in the
glo-cal weighted
system (35

out of the 38 correctly detected), while it decreases substantially when the
syntactic construction is not taken into account, as in the
global
model (28
out of the 32 successfully recognised). However, it is interesting to note that
looking at the overall accuracy in the detection of correct
local
instances, it
is the
global
model to return the highest score, as shown in Figure 7.5

.
In
the
glo-cal
model a signiﬁcant fall is indeed observed, while in the
glo-cal
weighted
system the
local
accuracy decrease is less important.
These sys-
tems evidently return more false positives among the instances followed
by a direct object, therefore suﬀering reduction in terms of the
local
syntac-
tic accuracy.

Summing up the results
161
Achilles’ heel of the three systems, even though data are too exiguous to
draw deﬁnitive conclusions.
The
global
model succeeds in ﬁnding 4 of the
9 instances not acting as transitive verbs, while the others do worse. In fact,
some of the annotated metaphors always escape the systems, as in the case
of (36) where the similarity between verbs and word topics only yields a
literal reading:
(36)
[...]
Last quarter, conﬁdence among CEOs of U.S.-based companies
jumped
by 4.2 percent points in the YPO Global Pulse Survey, one of
the single-largest quarter gains in history.
[...]
Even if representing a restricted number, the investigation of saturated
and unsaturated utterances seems to conﬁrm the importance of necessar-
ily taking into account the syntactic structure of the motion verb for its
successful metaphorical detection.
The
glo-cal
model indeed only fails the
recognition of (30),
where it is not possible for the parser to retrieve the
object of the motion verb
lead
.
Results of the analysis of conventional ut-
terances in the two models outperforming the baseline show instead that
a successful detection is achieved regardless of the speciﬁc syntactic struc-
ture. However, one must be careful in the interpretation of these results, as
the number of examples is too exiguous and they were randomly selected.
Furthermore, it is in the recognition of instances acting as transitive verbs
that both the models suﬀer a low accuracy, due to the threshold set for the
identiﬁcation of metaphorical motion verbs.
Thus, summing up the above-described results, the following conclu-
sions can be drawn.
As regards the use of LDA topics alone as features
of the system, it can be stated that the performance on the recognition of
metaphorical instances is poor while returning a very large number of cor-
rect literal motion verbs.
Adding verb-direct object relations to the fea-
tures of the system improves the performance of the model, with a signiﬁ-
cant increase in the number of successful metaphorical detections. The
glo-
cal
model is the best performing system in retrieving the highest number
162
Chapter 7.
Evaluation of the system:
results and discussions
of metaphors, largely penalising the identiﬁcation of literal motion verbs
though.
In terms of F-score,
it is the
glo-cal weighted
model to represent
the best performing system.
The weights applied on the basis of the infor-
mation provided by the
global
approach improves slightly the performance
of the model if compared to the
glo-cal
strategy, leading indeed to a more
balanced model.
Although the number of metaphors decreases of almost
ten units (
enter
in (28) is labelled literal just like the
global
model does),
the
glo-cal weighted
model identiﬁes a larger number of correct literal in-
stances in return, hence able to distinguish the use of more conventional
metaphors.
Thus, information coming from LDA can slightly improve the
performance of the system towards more balanced results.
However, as it
does not provide any progress in the identiﬁcation of metaphors, the hy-
pothesis presented in Section 7.5.4 must be refuted.
7.7
Related unsupervised metaphor pro-
cessing systems performance
The fragmented picture of the ﬁeld of research, the lack of shared datasets
and the diﬀerent experimental settings are among the several reasons that
make the results of diﬀerent metaphor processing systems not directly
comparable.
In the case of the present thesis, the speciﬁc genre taken into
account, the choice of investigating a pre-deﬁnite sub-class of lexical items
and the dialogical nature of the continuous texts make the things more
complicated.
Even the largest publicly available resource annotated for metaphoric-
ity – i.e.
the VUAMC corpus – could not
ﬁt
the experimental settings of
the three systems proposed in this work.
The main issue is represented
by the large context
needed
by the LDA model for a reliable inference of
topic on new unseen documents.
Indeed, 362 is the total number of doc-
uments including motion verbs in the VUAMC. In this case,
the average
length of the utterance is of 27.46 words (punctuation excluded), hence a
7.7.
Related unsupervised metaphor processing systems performance
163
too small context for reliable topic representations.
Furthermore, it must
be borne in mind that the in the VUAMC the metaphorical procedure of an-
notation does not discriminate between conventional and unconventional
metaphorical expressions.
Thus, being conscious that “[t]he linguistic properties which can dis-
tinguish metaphors in one genre may not
apply to other genres” and
that “[e]ach of the systems is based on a diﬀerent theory of metaphor-
in-language” (Dunn,
2013c,
p.9),
here I use the results of related studies
employing unsupervised techniques for the identiﬁcation of metaphors to
indicatively draw a comparison that could shed more light on the perfor-
mance of systems proposed in this thesis.
Furthermore, due to the highly
unbalanced test set used for evaluation in this thesis, results must be dis-
cussed with due care.

results and discussions
It should be remembered that Shutova et al.
(2016) work on cherry-
picked examples extracted on the basis of precise syntactic relations.
In
the study of Shutova and Sun (2013) the system searches for metaphori-
cal expressions in the BNC – hence working on unrestricted texts – evalu-
ated against human judgements on the randomised selection of instances
tagged as metaphorical from the unsupervised system and other two base-
lines.
In the work of Shutova et al.
(2010) unsupervised noun and verb
clustering techniques are used for the identiﬁcation verb-subject and verb-
object metaphorical constructions in unrestricted text.
As for the systems
developed in this thesis, performance of the
glo-cal weighted
models is re-
ported since the best performing in terms of F-score.
As previously stated, the comparison proposed here is only indicative
due to the huge diﬀerences in the experimental settings.
However, the re-
sults seem to show that the performance of
glo-cal weighted
model is still
far from the those attained using unsupervised techniques in the ﬁeld of
the computational modelling of metaphors.
Adopting the same intuition
as Shutova et al. (2016) on using word embeddings similarity as proxy of
conceptual domains,
the
glo-cal weighted
model yields favourable results
however not reaching a high rate of performance as the WORDCOS system
proposed by the authors.
A signiﬁcant gap in performance is observed in
the precision of the CLUSTERING model, pointing out the weakness of the
glo-cal weighted
model.
This result seems to be also conﬁrmed by HGFC,
where the system attains a fair score in terms of precision,
reaching the
0.65.

CHAPTER 8
Summary and Conclusions
Metaphors are a fascinating product of human language. Their ubiquity in
every form and in any mode of communication makes them a very produc-
tive phenomenon. Metaphors can be used to delight the reader and/or the
speaker, they can enrich our communication but they can be also used as a
tool of manipulation of the reality we live in.
However, metaphors repre-
sent also a very complex phenomenon when it comes to its computational
understanding.
Several and diﬀerent linguistic layers are involved in its
detection and/or interpretation and this process is far for being deﬁned as
an easy task.
The present thesis has covered the topic of the computational mod-
elling of metaphors.
More precisely,
in this work the automatic identiﬁ-
cation of metaphors in continuous, dialogical and naturally-occurring po-
litical data has been dealt with,
proposing three algorithms that do not
rely on task-speciﬁc hand-crafted resources and try to minimise as far as
possible the need of labelled data. The focus of metaphorical investigation
has been represented by a selection of verbs drawn from Levin’s semantic
class n°51 of verbs of motion. This choice was motivated by recent ﬁndings
in cognitive-pragmatic studies in the realm of political discourse, unveil-
ing the role played by these lexical items in the communication strategies

Summary and Conclusions
deployed by public speakers.
Employing an ESP corpus focusing on the
genre of the atypical political speech of U.S. press brieﬁngs, the three de-
veloped models were tested on a random sample of utterances – coming
from U.S. White House Press Secretaries or administration personnel dis-
course – where motion verbs were annotated for novel metaphoricity by
human judges.
In Part I,
I started oﬀ with the presentation of the theoretical
back-
ground at the basis of the present thesis, also introducing the lexical items
under metaphorical analysis and the theory motivating their choice.
In
Chapter 2,
particular attention was dedicated to the inﬂuence of the lin-
guistic structure in the reading and interpretation of metaphors.
A binary
distinction was indeed delineated by Dunn (2013b) based on conceptual
metaphorical patterns – i.e.
the presence of both target and source con-
cepts in an utterance or of only elements from the target domain – to be
later used for a qualitative analysis of systems’ performance.
In Chapter
3, an overview of the unsupervised methodologies used in this thesis for
the metaphor recognition of the verbs of motion is provided.
The ﬁeld of
research of the computational modelling of metaphors is then introduced,
discussing its main features and the related works, with a particular focus
on those studies leveraging the potential of the unsupervised techniques
previously presented.
In Part II, the political data used for the metaphor recognition task are
presented.
Chapter 4 focuses on the description of the building of the
CompWHoB corpus,
its NLP features and the qualitative aspects of the
collected in this resource.
One of the major contribution of the present thesis is indeed repre-
sented by the computational development of the pre-existing WHoB cor-
pus – kindly donated to the candidate by Prof.
Marco Venuti – since being
the initial core of this work. The main speciﬁc characteristics of the corpus,
in particular its genre and the related linguistic features have been taken
into account before deﬁning the aims of research. The CompWHoB corpus
represents an important and necessary upgrade of the WHoB corpus un-
169
der diﬀerent perspectives.
In terms of coverage, the time-span is not only
widely extended, but it is constantly updated with the most recent press
brieﬁngs published on the APP website.
Under a computational linguis-
tic perspective,
the corpus is now equipped with a NLP pipeline includ-
ing the main steps of linguistic pre-processing, in this way allowing to be
independent from external tools for its (computational) linguistic investi-
gation.
Furthermore, under a more IT aspect, the structural annotation is
now not only fully automatised but, extracting information directly from
huge databases such as DBpedia and Wikidata,
it is now possible to col-
lect essential social characteristics about the identity of the institutional
speakers in the brieﬁng.
All these aspects make the CompWHoB corpus
an important resource for several research ﬁelds, ranging from social and
political sciences to computational linguistics.
Finally,
to the best of my
knowledge,
this is the only corpus publicly available on request dealing
with the atypical political genre of the U.S. press brieﬁngs.
Going back to Part II, in Chapter 5 the lexical items under metaphor-
ical
investigation – i.e.
the verbs of motion – were quantitatively anal-
ysed and the criteria of their selection for the task were described.
The
results of an introductory task of annotation were used to explore the liter-
alness/metaphoricity of motion verbs based on the level of metaphorical
analysis set in the task.
Finally, the novel procedure for the annotation of
the unconventional metaphorical usage of verbs of motion in the corpus
was introduced,
which results were used as test set for the evaluation of
the proposed algorithms.
In Part III,
the three algorithms for the metaphor recognition of the
selected verbs of motion in the context of U.S.
press brieﬁngs were pre-
sented and evaluated. In Chapter 6, the intuition and the motivations at the
basis of the approaches supporting the development of the three systems
for metaphor identiﬁcation were discussed.
After describing in detail the
three algorithms, in Chapter 7 the performance of the three models were
presented and discussed at length.
On the basis of these results, I am now
ready to answer the three research questions.
170
Chapter 8.
Summary and Conclusions
Let us begin with the ﬁrst one:
RQ1
Can we move towards a
syntax-agnostic
approach when dealing with
the automatic recognition of metaphors employing broadly-based
distributional semantics techniques such as word embeddings and
topic models? More precisely:
(i)
How does the use of these two unsupervised techniques per-
form on lexical items when no syntactic information is taken
into consideration?
(ii)
Does the information coming from topic modelling improve the
performance of the system when syntactic information is taken
into account?
The intuition at
the basis of the
global
approach is that
the motion
verb being metaphorically used should be inconsistent with the utterance’s
topic(s) in which it is included, hence showing a low semantic relation with
it.
A clear answer to the Question (i) of RQ1 has been provided in Section
7.6.
The model only based on the
global
approach yields indeed the low-
est score among the three algorithms proposed in this thesis.
The correct
number of metaphors recognised by the model is barely above the half of
the total number of instances found in the human-annotated gold-standard
test set. Furthermore, the
global
approach represents the Achilles’ heel also
of the
glo-cal
and
glo-cal weighted
systems, as discussed in Section 7.6.
Turning to Question (ii) of RQ1, we are focusing in this case speciﬁcally
on the performance of the
glo-cal weighted
model.
Results show that using
topic modelling’s output to
inform
the
local
approach does not improve the
performance of the model on the recognition of metaphoricity of motion
verbs.
However,
the joint use of LDA and word embeddings leads to a
more balanced model and brings an overall improvement in terms of F-
score, hence deﬁning the
glo-cal weighted
algorithm as the best performing
one.
171
The reasons of the
syntax-agnostic
approach low performance in the
recognition of metaphors may be hypothesised to come down to one or
more of the following points:
• inaccuracy of the LDA inference process on too short documents;
• word distribution over the topic not suﬃciently representative of the
semantic content of the topic itself;
•
anonymous
semantic value of
the lexical
item under investigation
when compared to the topic’s word distribution, i.e. the motion verb
is not distinctive enough in that semantic context (e.g. due to its high
occurrence and its versatility across the corpus being too general).
Thus,
the answer to both (i)
and (ii)
of
this ﬁrst
research question
must be considered negative at the moment.
Although further research
is needed to conﬁrm this response, a
syntax-agnostic
approach combining
LDA and word embeddings as implemented in the present thesis is still far
from reaching signiﬁcant results.
Let us move on to the second research question:
RQ2
On the basis of Dunn (2013b)’ claim that the linguistic structure of
an utterance inﬂuences its metaphorical reading leading to a binary
distinction between
saturated
1
and
unsaturated
2
utterances:
(i)
Can it be observed any inﬂuence of the particular linguistic
structure in the ﬁnal performance of the metaphor recognition
system?
(ii)
Does the
global
approach help improve the performance of the
algorithm in the detection of
metaphors in saturated utter-
ances?
1
Either an entirely metaphorical or non-metaphorical reading is possible.
2
Only a metaphorical reading is possible.
172
Chapter 8.
Summary and Conclusions
The small number of instances analysed in Section 7 and the restricted
number of saturated utterances does not allow to draw deﬁnitive conclu-
sions from this second research question.
However, if taken with the due
caution, results can still represent indicative pointers of metaphorical in-
vestigation.
Addressing Question (i) of RQ2,
the qualitative analysis of systems’
performance on the 7 selected examples in Chapter 7 reveals that utter-
ances including (metaphorical) verb-direct objects relations are more likely
to be correctly tagged by the system if the particular syntactic structure is
taken into consideration.
The
glo-cal
algorithm – the best performing in
the detection of metaphorically used verbs of motion – indeed only fails
in recognising the metaphorical value of the verb not followed by a direct
object.
However, I reiterate that these conclusions can only be considered
tentative at the moment.
This answer leads in turn to Question (ii) of RQ2, being also strictly con-
nected to the RQ1.
Only using a
global
approach does not seem to provide
the algorithm with the information necessary for the correct recognition
of metaphorical motion verbs in saturated utterances, where saturation is
caused by
taken-for-granted
background knowledge and lexical ambiguity.
This is evident in the results of the
global
model,
as discussed in Section
7.5.2.
Indeed,
the system does fail the correct detection of the utterance
(24) – basically consisting of just the sentence including the verb of motion
– where context information is reduced to the minimum.
The reasons for
this
behaviour
must be found in the above-stated ones of RQ1.
Thus,
going back to (i) of RQ2,
the analysis carried out in Chapter 7
tends to indicate that,
in the context of the present work,
the diﬀerence
between saturated and unsaturated utterances does not play a signiﬁcant
role.
On the contrary, it is the focus on the syntactic structure to inﬂuence
the ﬁnal performance of the system.
Finally, let us turn to third and last research question:
RQ3
Avoiding the recourse to any task-speciﬁc hand-coded knowledge
and labelled data, does the joint use of word embeddings and topic
173
modelling compare favourably with metaphor processing systems
based on unsupervised approaches present in literature?
Due to the extremely unbalanced test set used in the evaluation stage,
results of the three models proposed in this thesis have been
handled
with
due care.
The answer to this research question has been addressed in
Section 7.7,
showing that only a negative answer can be provided.
Even
though taking into consideration the best performing system – i.e.
the
glo-cal weighted
model – and the role played by the diﬀerent experimen-
tal settings in other studies,
results indicate the performance attained in
this thesis are still far from those reached in the main relevant works em-
ploying unsupervised techniques for metaphor recognition.
Some of the
reasons that can explain these modest results must be found in the answers
to the previous research questions. However, it should not be forgotten the
role played by the conversational features of the utterances analysed in this
work, and the resulting hurdles for computational investigation.
Thus,
summing up,
in the present thesis a novel
approach combin-
ing broadly-based distributional
semantics unsupervised techniques for
the automatic recognition of metaphors in text has been proposed.
This
work has focused on the identiﬁcation of novel metaphorical use of a selec-
tion of verbs of motion in atypical political conversational genre of White
House press brieﬁngs.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study
to explicitly focus on the automatic recognition of metaphors in naturally-
occurring,
continuous and dialogical texts.
Although biased by a highly
unbalanced test set, models’ performance shows that the a
syntax-agnostic
approach is still far from being accomplished combining topic models and
word embeddings as implemented in this thesis.
Even though perfor-
mance can be only considered modest, promising results can be observed
in the
local
approach,
highlighting the importance of leveraging the syn-
tactic context for metaphor recognition and at the same time representing
an important stimulus for improvement on this path of research.
Thus, the present thesis shows that there is plenty of room for progress.
One of the future directions is undoubtedly represented by the enhance-
174
Chapter 8.
Summary and Conclusions
ment of the topic modelling process on conversational texts.
Topic mod-
els are not to be ditched in the exploration of metaphors, but they should
represent only one of the multiple features of a computational modelling
system of metaphors.
In order to achieve better results,
a future step is
represented by a more in-depth linguistic pre-processing of each utter-
ance due to the characteristics of the dialogical texts.
Anaphora resolution
seems indeed necessary for focusing on a larger number of syntactic rela-
tions.
Another future direction is to take into account the gradient nature
of metaphors.
Indeed, as we have seen, human judges identiﬁed only 60
novel metaphorical usages of motion verbs in more than 1000 podium’s
utterances.
This ﬁgures lead to highlight the importance of taking into
account diﬀerent metaphorical levels, without marking their membership
in only two particular classes.
Thus, a future line of investigation is repre-
sented by the enhancement of word embeddings techniques as tools for the
gradient representation of metaphoricity,
as their promising results have
shown.
Finally,
since this thesis also contributes to the linguistic resources in
NLP, as future project a new release of the CompWHoB corpus is sched-
uled,
equipped with a richer NLP pipeline also including NER and co-
reference resolution steps.
Furthermore,
the plan is to make the corpus
available in the near future on a web platform where a dedicated interface
will allow to easily navigate the resource.

Introduction
In this document the tasks you are kindly asked to carry out are explained
and shown to you.
More speciﬁcally, you will be dealing with the anno-
tation of the metaphorical or literal use of motion verbs (do not worry, ev-
erything will be clear at the end of the document.
Or I hope so).
As intro-
ductory step, a very brief overview of the CompWHoB corpus is provided
to you in order to better understand its content and structure.
A.1.1
The Corpus:
Press Briefings and the CompWHoB Cor-
pus
CompWHoB is an acronym that stands for Computational White House
Press Brieﬁngs (corpus).
This corpus is a diachronic collection of
the
transcriptions of the United States of America Press Brieﬁngs,
the press
conferences held by the White House Press Secretaries (and other ad-
ministration personnel) for the national
and international
news media.
The brieﬁngs are extracted from the American Presidency Project website
www.presidency.ucsb.edu
, where the Press Brieﬁngs document archive

section can be freely consulted.
The CompWHoB corpus covers a period
time of twenty-four years and seven presidencies,
from the ﬁrst term of
William J. Clinton till the ﬁrst term of Donald J. Trump.
The U.S Press Brieﬁngs are considered as part of a wider category of
political press conferences as the recipient is not only represented by the
press present at the scene,
but also by the audience at home.
Moreover,
being these brieﬁngs daily held by U.S. administration, both the speakers
- i.e.
the press secretaries and the journalists - know each other very well.
This means that sometimes the topic may diverge from the institutional
ones, with both speakers even joking about their private life.
The topics related to the U.S. governance discussed during the brieﬁngs
have been summed up in the following macro-categories:
• Crime & Justice
• Culture & Education
• Economy & Welfare
• Foreign Aﬀairs
• Greetings
• Health
• Internal Politics
• Legislation & Reforms
• Military & Defense
• President Updates
• Presidential News
• Press Issues
A.2.
Annotation Tasks
179
As said before,
sometimes the topic discussed by journalists and ad-
ministration cannot be included in some oﬃcial categories and you may
encounter utterances where the speakers talk about everything but poli-
tics.
A.1.2
The CompWHoB Structure
The data extracted from the American Presidency Project website are col-
lected and encoded in an XML format, a markup language that allows doc-
uments to be easily readable for both humans and machines alike.
Each
brieﬁng consists of a series of question-answer between journalists and the
U.S administration personnel. For the sake of clarity, in the corpus the U.S.
administration personnel is always referred to as
podium
while the news
media members are referred to as
journalists
.
As the original transcripts
contained also meta-textual information enclosed in brackets about audi-
ence reactions and speech events descriptions (e.g. (Laughter), (Applause),
etc.), self-closing tags are used to identify these events in the corpus (e.g.
in the case of a pause in either podium or journalists utterances, you will
encounter the following tag:
<pause/>
).
A.2
Annotation Tasks
In this section the annotation tasks you are kindly asked to perform are
described (by the way, thank you very much in advance!). As you will deal
with the annotation of the metaphorical or literal usage of motion verbs, in
Section A.2.1 I ﬁrst illustrate the concept of metaphor.
In Section A.2.2 an
overview of the lexical items you will be working on is provided.
Finally,
in Section A.2.3.2 and A.2.3.3 the annotation procedures are described.
A.2.1
Metaphors
According to the scientiﬁc literature, a metaphor is perceived in language
when there is an association between distinct and seemingly unrelated con-
180

cepts.
Let’s take a political domain example extracted from a scientiﬁc pa-
per (Shutova, 2015):
(37)
The President
Obama is
rebuilding
the campaign
machinery
that
vaulted
him into oﬃce" (New York Times, 2011)
In the example (37), we can see that there is a metaphor in use. The po-
litical system is indeed viewed as a machinery, and terms are drawn from
this speciﬁc domain (conventionally used with physical targets).
In this
example,
we deﬁne the sentence as whole as a
conceptual metaphor
,
since
we can see that there is a mapping between two diﬀerent domains of ex-
perience.
More in detail, in (37) we can say that the verbs
rebuild
and
vault
,
and the noun
machinery
, are used metaphorically as not making reference
to concrete objects.
Recognising a metaphor is not an easy task though.
Some metaphors
are so rooted in our use of language that we hardly recognise them as such.
Let’s take a look at (38):
(38)
A Metropolitan Police oﬃcer used the force’s computer systems and
colluded with a Croydon Council worker
to dig up
information to
use in a dispute over a dodgy second-hand car,
a court has heard.
(Croydonguardian, 2016)
In everyday language,
the use of the phrasal
verb
to dig up
plus an
abstract concept such as
information
has become widespread,
making its
metaphor detection not trivial at all.
In this case, the use of the verb
to dig
up
is metaphorical as the journalist refers to the information as a ‘ground’
material that can be brought to light.
Nonetheless,
as this use is becom-
ing conventionalised over time, we consider it as a
conventional
metaphor.
What this deﬁnition implies is that even a native speaker may overlook the
metaphorical charge of this verb phrase.
Indeed, one of the ﬁrst clues that
help humans in recognising a metaphor as such is that they appear to be
expressions out of context.

Two excerpts from the CompWHoB corpus can help us in tracing a
dividing line between the literal and metaphorical aspects that need to be
taken into consideration in this task:
(39)
I mean, we might or, we might start saying to the American people,
you want to know how much money we’re spending to
chase down
these stray bits of information
because we’ve got some overzealous staﬀ
people up there who are trying to keep us from doing our work.
(40)
May of this year:
"I’ve talked about the idea of having a diﬀerent
force posture that would enable us to be there to help the Iraqis in a
variety of ways, protect the border,
chase down al Qaeda
, embed and
train the troops, provide security, psychological security of helping
this new government."
In (39) the verb
chase down
is used metaphorically because the direct
object of the verb - i.e.
these stray bits of information
- is treated as a phys-
ical object despite being an abstract entity,
hence mapping together two
diﬀerent domains of experience.
Nonetheless,
again there is not a clear
distinction between literal and metaphorical use.
In (40) the verb
chase down
is used literally. Since we usually chase down
people and/or objects,
al Qaeda
complies with the linguistic conditions re-
quired by the verb itself.
Even if in this case another ﬁgure of speech is
present, more precisely the metonymy
al Qaeda
, you are not asked to iden-
tify them as well.
To sum up, to best detect the metaphor use of a word in this task, the
deﬁnition provided by the online dictionary Merriam Webster
1
comes in
handy:
“[Metaphor]:
a ﬁgure of speech in which a word or phrase literally
denoting one kind of object or idea is used in place of another to suggest a
likeness or analogy between them (as in
drowning in money
).”

Your Data:
Motion Verbs Utterances
The data you will be working on are a random sample of the podium utter-
ances extracted from the CompWHoB corpus.
Questions coming from the
journalists are not included in these data.
The utterances are selected ac-
cording to a common criterion:
they all contain one or more
motion verbs
.
These verbs were selected according to the taxonomy provided by Levin
(1993) in her work
English verb classes and alternations:
A preliminary investi-
gation
.
As their pretty much self-explanatory deﬁnition states, these verbs
are characterised for encoding in their meaning a speciﬁc kind of motion
as in
“[...] they fly out of neighboring countries”
but also in
“[...] the President
might enter in the fray himself”
.
Each verb is enclosed in an XML tag that allows the annotation to be
performed by the user.
The XML format chosen is the following:
<motverb usage=" "> motion verb </motverb>
A.2.3
Annotating the Data
A.2.3.1
What your data look like
As previously said, every utterance will contain one or more motion verbs.
Then, in your data a sentence like (39) will look like as follows:
(41)
I mean, we might or, we might start saying to the American people,
you want to know how much money we’re spending to
<motverb
usage=" ">
chase
<motverb>
down these stray bits of information
because we’ve got some overzealous staﬀ people up there who are
trying to keep us from doing our work.
As you can see, in this case only the verb itself is enclosed in the XML
tag but not the particle accompanying it and forming the phrasal verb. This
is due to a step in the linguistic pre-processing of the text that allows to
recognise the verb but not its phrasal-verb value if present.
A.2.
Annotation Tasks
183
The utterances you will be dealing with may vary in length.
They are
actually paragraphs most of the time consisting of more than two sen-
tences.
The choice of extracting entire paragraphs is necessary for the un-
derstanding of the potential metaphorical charge of a verb.
Indeed, some
metaphors may not be detected until their context is inspected.
To make it
clear, Jonathan Dunn’s examples (Dunn, 2013b) come to our aid:
(42)
Mary demolished John’s stronghold with her newly found evidence.
(43)
Mary demolished John’s stronghold with her newly found weapon.
If we can be sure that (42) is a metaphorical utterance, the same cannot
be said of (43). In this case our reading is uncertain because we do not know
what the context of the sentence is. Maybe Mary just bought a bazooka that
destroyed John’s castle.
This is why the importance of the surrounding
context will be emphasised in the following section.
A.2.3.2
Task 1:
Annotation Procedure
As said in Section A.2.3.1,
some paragraphs may increase the degree of
certainty of the metaphoricity or literal judgement by inspecting the sur-
rounding context.
However, being these paragraphs most of the times an-
swers to journalists’ questions, they may be full of anaphoras that make it
hard to spot the subject of the whole paragraph (and consequently also the
detection of the metaphorical or literal use).
Moreover,
some utterances
may consist of single sentences that will make the judgement even harder.
Bearing in mind the nature of the data just described, I illustrate here
the procedure to annotate the metaphorical
or literal
charge of motion
verbs:
1.
Carefully read the whole utterance to understand the general mean-
ing of the content.
184
Appendix A.
Annotation Guidelines
2.
Carefully read the context of the verb under analysis.
If the utter-
ance consists of more than just the sentence containing the verb itself,
compare its content to the previous and following sentences.
3.
Determine the meaning of the verb in the particular context in which
it appears by paying attention to its close surroundings. If the words
around the verb do not provide the necessary information,
look at
the wider context.
4.
Determine the basic meaning of the verb.
In this task, consider the
basic meaning of the verb as the one that tends to be more concrete
and tangible. Basic meaning can be often considered as the one clos-
est to its etymological one and it is usually listed as the ﬁrst entry in
a dictionary (Beware!
Some dictionaries use the highest occurrence
collected in a corpus.
It does not necessarily entail that the highest
occurrence is the literal meaning of a word).
5.
Compare now the basic meaning of
the verb with its contextual
meaning, i.e.
the meaning of the verb in the particular context you
are analysing.
If its contextual
meaning contrasts with the basic
meaning of the verb but it can be understood in comparison with
it (
original
properties of the verb emerge in the interpretation of its
meaning), mark it as metaphorical, otherwise as literal.
An example
is provided here in order to make the procedure more clear.
e.g.
“Don’t try to
twist
what I said into something else.” Contex-
tual meaning:
In this context,
‘twist’ indicates to repeat someone’s
original
message/words drastically changing the
original
meaning of
what been said, often in a negative way.
• Contextual
meaning:
In this context,
‘twist’
indicates to re-
peat
someone’s
original
message/words drastically changing
the
original
meaning of what been said, often in a negative way.
• Basic meaning:
The basic meaning of ‘twist’ is to form some-
thing into a particular shape, often a distorted one.
A.2.
Annotation Tasks
185
• Contextual vs.
basic meaning:
The contextual meaning can be
understood in the terms (better said,
semantic aspects) of the
basic meaning.
We can understand the change of the
original
meaning of someone’s message via the physical distortion con-
veyed by the verb ‘twist’.
6.
After having performed the previous steps, express your judgement:
a)
If in your opinion the verb is used metaphorically, insert ‘
MTP
’
in the ‘usage’ ﬁeld between double quotes.
e.g.
<motverb usage="MTP">...</motverb>
b)
If in your opinion the verb is used literally, insert ‘
LTR
’ in the
‘usage’ ﬁeld between double quotes.
e.g.
<motverb usage="LTR">...</motverb>
c)
If it is not possible to identify the reading as either metaphorical
or literal, insert ‘
UNK
’ in the
usage
ﬁeld between double quotes.
e.g.
<motverb usage="UNK">...</motverb>
If you desire, you can consult any dictionary you prefer to ascertain the
etymology of the verb, its primary literal meaning (if there is one) and its
syntactic use and semantic requirements.

dictionaries that may come in handy:

Annotation Guidelines
Once the annotation process is complete,
you can send your anno-
tated ﬁle to the following email:
fabrizio.esposito3@unina.it
.
In or-
der to safeguard your privacy,
please save the ﬁle under this text format
compwhob_motverbs_annotated_nutt.xml
and replace the string of text
nutt
with the number of utterances you annotated.
A word of caution
. In reading your utterance, you may encounter some
verbs that were mistakenly tagged as such by the system.
For instance, in
the following example, the noun
follow-up
is incorrectly tagged as a verb:
e.g.
The President
will
speak only after a
<motverb usage=" ">
follow-up
</motverb>
If you bump into one of them, I kindly ask you to notify us by inserting
the label ‘
WVB
’ in the
usage
ﬁeld between double quotes.
e.g.
<motverb usage="WVB">...</motverb>
Furthermore,
the data you will
be provided with will
be presented
as single tokens,
separating each part-of-speech element from the other
(punctuation included). Each one is separated from the other with a front-
and end-whitespace.
You may also encounter double whitespaces in your
data.
These are remainings of the meta-textual XML tags.
They can be
considered as a normal whitespace (no implicit meaning then).
A.2.3.3
Task 2:
Annotation Procedure
In this second annotation task you are kindly asked to identify the novel (or
unconventional) metaphorical usage of motion verbs as opposed to their
literal or conventional metaphorical use.
As the terminology might be a
little bit confusing,
let me ﬁrst explain the diﬀerence between novel and
conventional metaphors.
Try to ﬁgure out the
life
of a metaphor as a trajectory:
metaphors are
born
in nature
as novel (hence, just the way they are).
We intuitively and
readily recognise them either in speech or in text due to their metaphorical
charge
, as in a certain way they
break
our usual logical reasoning.
Indeed,
we are not able to interpret metaphors automatically as they are highly
incongruous and they are not systematically used in our language.
They
A.2.
Annotation Tasks
187
associate two seemingly unrelated domains of experience, making us per-
ceive them as
novel
.
For example,
in
She was warming my winter days
,
we
instantly realise the association between the unusual comparison, under-
standing the metaphorical nature of the expression.
The target term
She
is
used in this case to refer to something else, to the source topic HEAT/SUN.
However, when a metaphor starts to be used intensively and for a long
time by its speakers, its meaning becomes so common that it
loses
its origi-
nal aspect of novelty. Indeed, we are able to understand it almost automat-
ically,
sometimes without even realise that we are actually dealing with
a metaphorical expression.
Let us take as way of example the following
headline from a well-known newspaper webpage: “Time is running out for
Madagascar - evolution’s last, and greatest, laboratory”
2
.
The metaphori-
cal expression
time is running out
is so entrenched in everyday use of En-
glish language that some native speakers (but not only them) may ﬁnd hard
to recall its
original
metaphorical nature and its corresponding hidden con-
cept TIME IS AS A LIMITED RESOURCE.
Thus, in this task you are only asked to identify as
metaphorical
those
instances of
motion verbs that
correspond to the description of
novel
metaphors above-provided.
As opposed to the novel metaphors,
under
the umbrella term
literal
, the instances of motion verbs being used either
literally (i.e.
using their basic meaning) or in a metaphorical conventional
way are included.
I illustrate here the procedure for the annotation of the metaphorical or
literal use of motion verbs. Remember that a metaphorical expression is in
place if a linguistic expression is used to refer to something else, comparing
two diﬀerent domains of experience/knowledge.
1.
Carefully read the whole utterance to understand the general mean-
ing of the content.

2.
Carefully read the context of the verb under analysis.
If the utter-
ance consists of more than just the sentence containing the verb itself,
compare its content to the previous and following sentences.
3.
Try to understand the topic of the utterance. The motion verb is likely
to be used metaphorically (conventionally or unconventionally) if it
is in discordance with the topic of discussion.
4.
Determine the meaning of the verb in the particular context in which
it appears by paying attention to its close surroundings. If the words
around the verb do not provide the necessary information,
look at
the wider context.
5.
If the basic meaning of the verb is in contrast with its contextual
meaning, the verb is likely to be used metaphorically.
6.
If in your opinion the verb is used metaphorically, determine if it is
novel or conventional.
Two are the main clues for the recognition of
a metaphor as novel:
• its meaning is not
ﬁxed (as in conventional
metaphors)
but
rather
idiosyncratically
produced.
• you may feel
relatively unfamiliar with the metaphorical
ex-
pression, hence requiring a certain eﬀort to understand it.
7.
After having performed the previous steps, express your judgement:
a)
If in your opinion the verb is used metaphorically, insert ‘
MTP
’
in the ‘usage’ ﬁeld between double quotes.
e.g.
<motverb usage="MTP">...</motverb>
b)
If in your opinion the verb is used literally, insert ‘
LTR
’ in the
‘usage’ ﬁeld between double quotes.
e.g.
<motverb usage="LTR">...</motverb>

Well, go back to use Peter Welch as an example, which is that Peter
Welch would agree that leaving the lights on at a federal building
overnight with nobody there is bad government.
So why spend our

I can’t say that there’ll never be and again, I’m not going to be fatal-
istic when we’ve got a vote at 3:30 p.m.
I know that the President
has made it clear that this is the eﬀort, this was the train that’s leav-
ing the station,
and that he expects everyone you know,
this is our
opportunity.
And he’s got a lot left on the agenda that he wants to
get done, whether it’s immigration, taxes, the border wall. There’s so
many other things that he wants to get done that we’re not going to
sit around and ﬁgure out this is the opportunity, this is the time, this
is the opportunity for every member who has said that they want to
repeal and replace Obamacare to put their vote in the “yes” column.

Well, listen, “resigned” is not at all the word that I would use. I think
it was evident from the Democrats in the room that the President
feels quite passionate about all of these issues.
And the President is
conﬁdent that the kind of argument that Democrats can put forward
is a winning one.
So the President continues to be very conﬁdent,
particularly on this issue of the Aﬀordable Care Act,
in the ability
of Democrats to make the kind of argument that’s going to resonate
deeply with the American people.
And there’s already some evi-
dence that Republicans are uneasy about this, both as and so the two
pieces of evidence that I cited today are the op-ed from Senator Paul
and the inability of one of the most articulate Republicans on Capi-
tol Hill to explain why Republicans don’t have their own replace-
ment plan to put forward, even though he’s the guy who’s respon-
sible for putting that plan forward.
So I think that is an indication
that Republicans are already starting to reckon with the challenge
of keeping this promise.
At the same time,
the President acknowl-
edges that he’s leaving the national stage.
That’s what the Constitu-
tion requires.
That’s certainly consistent with his wife’s preferences.
And it’s going to be time for somebody else to pick up the mantle.
Does that mean that the President is any less committed to these is-
sues than he was before? Of course not.
But it does mean that the
President expects to be in a position that he can observe the kinds of
customs and courtesy, frankly, that was aﬀorded to him by his prede-
cessor.Now, the President has also been clear, and the President did
discuss this in the meeting as well, that he’s hopeful that this won’t
happen.
But if there are basic,
fundamental American values that
are undermined by a speciﬁc policy proposal, then he may feel the
need to speak out. But it is his hope, and I would say even his expec-
tation, that that’s not something that he will have to do.
And I think
the other thing I want to point out here and I think this is relevant to
the entire context what I’m trying to lay out and describe to you is
the President’s plans for the ﬁrst year or two that he’s out of oﬃce.

And President Obama is obviously leaving this oﬃce at a young age
he’s just 55 and I think that there’s he still has a lot of ambition and
a lot more that he would like to do.
Most of it he hopes he will be
able to do behind the scenes in terms of continuing to stay true to his
roots as a community organizer, and motivating and inspiring and
even oﬀering training to people who feel called in a similar direction.
He wants to make sure that public servants, or people who aspire to
public oﬃce are people who can get trained in the fundamentals of
community organizing.
He wants to make sure that young people
around the world are exposed to the kinds of values and principles
and norms and customs and traditions of the United States when it
comes to democracy and citizen engagement and respect for all peo-
ple, and even entrepreneurship.
These are things that the President
has talked about as a President and something that he hopes to con-
tinue in his post-presidency.So I don’t want to leave you with the
impression that there’s still not a lot of important work for former
President Obama to be engaged in there is.
He recognizes that.
And
he’s got a long to-do list.
But that is diﬀerent than being engaged
in the same back-and-forth that he’s responsible for engaging in as
President.

Well, I guess this is the point. So I’m glad you say that, because this, I
think, is the point.
The President is relying on his military advisors.
They have not put forward a speciﬁc plan that would address the
concerns that I’ve just raised. They acknowledge that. The President
is relying on them for the good military advice that he’s getting thus
far that is having the tangible impact of applying additional pres-
sure on ISIL.
We have made progress,
just looking inside of Syria,
in terms of regaining more than 20 percent of the territory that ISIL
previously controlled.
And we’ve done that just by training forces
202
Appendix D.
Utterances for Metaphorical Analysis
inside of Syria.
So we are making progress in encircling Raqqa.
We
are applying signiﬁcant pressure against ISIL in Syria.
We are mak-
ing progress in terms of shutting oﬀ the border they beneﬁt from.So
the point is the President is relying on the best military advice. He is
following that military advice, and it’s showing results.
Not as fast
as we would like; it certainly hasn’t turned Syria into a Jeﬀersonian
democracy that reﬂects the pluralism and diversity of that country.
But we are making progress. And it’s because the President is relying
on the best advice that’s out there.So it’s important to remember that
for all of the criticism about how the President’s policy has not led
to the kind of results that we’d all like to see inside of Syria, it’s not
because the President has failed to consider or implement an alter-
native proposal. There is nobody else that has put forward a speciﬁc
idea with the possible exception of the safe zone that you referred
to.
I think the President has laid out in pretty clear terms why he
doesn’t think that’s a good idea.
And the truth is you don’t hear
a whole lot of people talking about that anymore, and I don’t even
know if that was mentioned in the speech today from,
frankly,
the
President’s most high-proﬁle critic.
(23)
Well,
John,
I think it’s always important to evaluate the context of
those numbers.
And one important piece of context is simply that
there was an historic wave that entered oﬃce at the end of 2008 and
the beginning of 2009 of Democratic elected oﬃcials who beneﬁt-
ted from President Obama being at the top of the ballot in 2008.
So
when we’re talking about those kinds of numbers, it’s important to
recognize that those numbers got built up in the ﬁrst place because
of President Obama’s political success in winning the White House
the ﬁrst time.That said, the President is the leader of the Democratic
Party. And he has been disappointed, particularly with regard to this
most recent election, that a lot of good Democratic elected oﬃcials,
public servants didn’t succeed at the ballot box.
And the President
has expressed his view about why that is.
It includes the need for
D.2.
Unsaturated utterances
203
Democratic activists and Democratic voters to express their view per-
suasively in communities all across the country, and that certainly is
part of the challenge that President Obama is going to spend some
time thinking about as a former President.
And this will certainly
be the challenge that the incoming Democratic Party chairman will
take on in taking oﬃce and making sure that Democrats are showing
up and competing in communities all across the country.
We’ve got
the values right, we’ve got the policy prescriptions right, but we just
need to go and make the argument.
And the President is conﬁdent
that if and when Democrats do that,
there are important gains for
the party and for the country that lie ahead.Let me just run through
the week ahead real quick.
On Saturday,
the President will travel
to Jacksonville, Florida to attend the wedding ceremony of a White
House staﬀer.
There will be no media coverage of the event.
This
is just a private event and the President is looking forward to it.On
Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.
On
Tuesday,
the President will travel to Chicago,
Illinois,
as we’ve dis-
cussed, to deliver his farewell address to the American people. In the
address, he will thank his supporters, celebrate the ways the coun-
try has changed these past eight years, and oﬀer some thoughts on
where the country will go from here.
The First Lady, the Vice Pres-
ident, and Dr.
Biden will also attend.Through the rest of the week,
the President intends to attend meetings at the White House and it
should be an interesting week.Thanks, everybody, have a great week-
end.
(24)
Well, Jeﬀ, we continue to be deeply concerned about the provocations
and destabilizing activities that are mounted by the North Korean
regime.
The United States is strongly committed to denuclearizing
the Korean Peninsula and standing should-to-shoulder with our al-
lies in the Republic of Korea as they face the threat from North Korea.
And that’s not going to change.There is an opportunity for the North
Korean government to escape the deep isolation that they currently
204
Appendix D.
Utterances for Metaphorical Analysis
face.
But it will require them to make a commitment to giving up
their nuclear program and coming into compliance with the wide
range of international obligations and U.N. Security Council resolu-
tions that they currently ignore.So we’ve been quite clear about what
we believe the North Korean government should do.
Thus far, they
have chosen the path of confrontation and provocation.
As soon as
they’re ready to consider an alternate path toward reconciliation the
international community will be ready to engage.Chris.
(25)
Great.
Thanks, Josh.
Let me just start by giving a bit of an overview
of the trip and the current expected schedule.
And let me just be-
gin by saying also that we see this trip as really bringing together a
number of the President’s top priorities really for the last seven and
a half years.First of all, there will be a signiﬁcant focus, particularly
on the front end of the trip, on the eﬀorts that we’ve been engaged
in to confront climate change.
There will also be a signiﬁcant focus
on the global economy through the G20.
And then, of course, this is
the President’s 10th trip to the Asia Paciﬁc region, and the rebalance
of the Asia Paciﬁc has been a centerpiece of our foreign policy.
And
the trip will give him an opportunity to once again make the case for
America’s focus on the Asia Paciﬁc, to make the case for TPP as a cen-
terpiece of our economic and strategic leadership in the region, and
to address some of the very pressing issues that are going to be on
the agenda.
The summit is including maritime issues and the South
China Sea.So,
again,
I think three big pieces of the presidency are
going to be front and center here through climate change, the global
economy and the Asia Paciﬁc region.
And I think the schedule will
illustrate that.Brian will give you greater detail on the energy and cli-
mate events.
As you know, we’ll be departing on Wednesday morn-
ing and he’ll have an initial stop in Nevada, where he will be speak-
ing at the annual Lake Tahoe Summit with Senator Harry Reid there.
And then that evening in Hawaii he will address leaders from the
Paciﬁc Island Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conser-
D.2.
Unsaturated utterances
205
vation Congress.
And this is the ﬁrst time that the United States has
hosted the World Conservation Congress an important opportunity
to bring together not just Paciﬁc island leaders who have been a mo-
tivating factor around the urgency of action against climate change,
but also conservation advocates from around the world.
And Brian
will speak in greater detail to his plans there.Thursday, he will travel
to Midway,
where he will be able to speak to the latest marine na-
tional monument that I will leave it to Brian to pronounce and de-
scribe to you, but I think we will be bringing together through these
three events both our domestic and international climate eﬀorts and
conservation eﬀorts. The United States has been leading at home and
we’ve been leading around the world in the pursuit of global action
against climate change. Following the trip to Midway, he will depart
on the morning of September 2nd for China. And then that afternoon
and evening in China,
he will be engaged in the bilateral program
with President Xi Jinping.
And this will be on Saturday, September
3rd, China time, because we will skip forward by a day.
And we ex-
pect that he’ll have both an extensive bilateral meeting, and then be
hosted for a small dinner by President Xi Jinping as has been prac-
ticed at their previous meetings. And this will build on the work that
we’ve done in our previous travel to Beijing, which included the his-
toric breakthrough announcement on cooperation on climate change
and also the engagements we’ve had here in Washington and Sun-
nylands with President Xi Jinping.
I think we’ll be reviewing all of
the issues that have been front and center in the U.S.-China relation-
ship for the last seven and a half years.
On the positive side,
we’ll
be able to review the progress we’ve made on the global economy,
on climate change, our shared eﬀorts to prevent the proliferation of
nuclear weapons through the Iran deal,
our shared concern about
the situation on the Korean Peninsula.
Of course,
we’ll also be ad-
dressing diﬀerences, as we always do with China, whether it relates
to cyber issues, some of the economic practices that we have raised
206
Appendix D.
Utterances for Metaphorical Analysis
concerns about, some of the tensions around maritime issues in the
South China Sea and, of course, our longstanding diﬀerences on hu-
man rights as well.
But,
again,
I think this is going to be the last
occasion of this sort for the President to spend several hours with his
Chinese counterpart and to review the state of U.S.-China relations
and to try to see where we can make progress, and working together
on areas of common interest or bridging some of the diﬀerences that
have been characteristic of the relationship.
So that will be the pro-
gram for Saturday,
September 3rd.
Then,
on the morning of Sun-
day,
September 4th,
in advance of the G20 Summit,
we expect that
the President will be able to have some bilateral meetings.
We cer-
tainly anticipate that one of those will be with President Erdogan of
Turkey. President Obama will want to discuss obviously the circum-
stances in Turkey since the attempted coup, as well as our counter-
ISIL campaign and our eﬀorts to promote greater stability in Syria
and to respond to the refugee crisis. We anticipate there will be addi-
tional bilateral meetings and we’ll keep you posted as they are sched-
uled.Then the President will move into the G20 schedule,
and I’ll
leave it to Wally to review the sessions and the agenda.
That begins,
again, on the afternoon of Sunday the 4th, and continues throughout
the day on Monday the 5th. And it will conclude the President’s time
in China with his press conference at the end of the G20. And, again,
we’ll keep you updated on any additional bilateral meetings that are
scheduled.On the evening of Monday, September 5th, the President
will ﬂy to Laos.
A few words about the program in Laos.
First of all,
this is the ﬁrst-ever U.S. presidential visit to Laos. It’s a truly historic
event for U.S.-Lao relationships and for the people and country of
Laos. We obviously have a very diﬃcult history with Laos, but given
our increased focus on the Asia Paciﬁc, given our attendance at the
ASEAN and East Asia Summit meetings and also given this Presi-
dent’s commitment to reach out to countries with whom we’ve had
complicated histories,
we see this as a real opportunity to advance
D.2.
Unsaturated utterances
207
the U.S.-Laos relationship, to begin to build a real working partner-
ship that can beneﬁt both of our peoples. And, again, I think the Pres-
ident’s program in Laos will demonstrate that.We will begin on Tues-
day, September 6th, with the bilateral program with the President of
Laos.
We also anticipate President Obama will have an opportunity
to interact with the Prime Minister of Laos as well. Laos has recently
gone through a leadership transition, but President Obama has been
able to engage both of those leaders through his ASEAN meetings in
the past.Again, I think the agenda with Laos will seek to identify ar-
eas where we can cooperate and we have an increasing development
relationship focused on education and health and human capital; an
increasing trade and investment relationship.
We also have the sub-
stantial eﬀort that we are ramping up to address the legacy of war in
Laos. For our part, we have been steadily increasing our commitment
to clearing unexploded ordnance in Laos, which has caused signiﬁ-
cant human suﬀering and been an impediment to development since
the conclusion of the Vietnam War.
We’ve been spending additional
resources each year as it relates to clearing unexploded ordnance,
and we anticipate the President will make this a focus of his visit.We
also have a POW/MIA recovery eﬀort in Laos that we’re commit-
ted to continuing to pursue and,
if necessary,
take additional steps
to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to recover those who
have been lost.After his bilateral program, the President will give a
speech that we anticipate to be an opportunity for him to step back
and review his Asia policy over the course of the last seven years.
I’ll think he’ll talk about how far we’ve come in shaping an archi-
tecture in the Asia Paciﬁc for the United States to lead and to be at
the table in forums like ASEAN and the East Asia Summit.
I think
he’ll speak to the fact that we’ve signiﬁcantly upgraded our commer-
cial and economic diplomacy in the region, our security presence in
the partnerships that we’re building, both with allies but also with
emerging partners on issues like maritime security and disaster re-
208
Appendix D.
Utterances for Metaphorical Analysis
sponse.
I think you’ll hear the President give a forceful case for TPP
and why it is essential to American economic and security interests
for Congress to move forward with approval of TPP.Again,
in this
part of the world, which is the largest emerging market in the world,
TPP is seen as a litmus test for U.S. leadership.
TPP allows us to es-
tablish the rules of the road for trade and commerce.
It’s also seen
as a demonstration of America’s commitment to be a Paciﬁc power.
And we would be stepping back from that leadership role. We would
be ceding the region to countries like China, who do not set the same
types of high standards for trade agreements, were we to not follow
through with TPP. So at each of his stops, including in this speech, I
think you’ll see the President make the case for TPP.He’ll also have an
opportunity to address both the enormous potential in the region for
greater connectivity economically, for greater cooperation, and also
some of the areas of recent diﬀerence, including the South China Sea
and our approach to maritime issues.
So following the speech,
we
anticipate the President will have time for a bilateral meeting with
President Duterte of the Philippines.
The Philippines is obviously a
treaty ally of the United States,
a party to the recent arbitral ruling
in the South China Sea.
I think we’ll want to review the state of play
as it relates to our treaty lines and the situation in the South China
Sea in that dialogue with the new President of the Philippines.
One
Wednesday, September 7th, we anticipate the President will have an
event devoted to unexploded ordnance, where he’ll be able to discuss
our eﬀorts to support the people of Laos as they seek to clear unex-
ploded ordnance, and have an opportunity to interact with some of
the workers and survivors who have confronted this issue. And then
the President will travel to Luang Prabang, which is a cultural capital
of Laos, an historical capital of Laos, where he’ll have an opportunity
to do a town hall meeting with some of our Southeast Asian Lead-
ers.
For those of you who have traveled with us, you know that the
YSEALI Initiative, like our African Leaders Initiative, has generated
D.3.
Conventional Metaphors
209
enormous enthusiasm in Southeast Asia.
It’s something the Presi-
dent is committed to, and he’ll have an opportunity for a town hall.
And we anticipate he’ll have some cultural stops in Luang Prabang,
as well.
Then,
that night is the gala dinner kicking oﬀ the ASEAN
and East Asia summits hosted back in Vientiane.Then, on Thursday,
September 8th, he will have the U.S.-ASEAN meeting and then the
East Asia Summit.
And again, we anticipate the potential for an ad-
ditional bilateral meeting.
And we’ll keep you updated as we have
any additions to the schedule.So again, I will stop there, and we can
deal with some of the speciﬁc issues at each of the stops in questions.
But let me turn it over to Brian to give you an overview of the climate
and energy event.
D.3
Conventional Metaphors
(26)
Look,
I think the President has talked extensively about education
during the primary, whether it’s an Associate’s Degree, a Bachelor’s
Degree, a PhD or vo-technical education that we’ve got to give stu-
dents these days the options they need for the workforce; that a vo-
tech education in some cases is what’s in the interest of students in
terms of their success,
and giving them the skills to work on cars
or become a computer engineer or whatever.
But as we head into
as we look towards the future,
we’ve got to make sure that we’re
preparing our students to have the skillset that they need.
And it’s
also the retraining aspect of that that as people get older and cer-
tain industries start to turn the corner because of technology,
that
we’re allowing people the opportunity for retraining to give them
the skillset that they need to reenter the workforce and continue to
be productive.So I think as you will see look, we literally will swear
in the Secretary of Education hopefully later this evening, which we
will let you all know probably around the 5:00 or 6:00 hour.
But that
will be something that he’s going to continue to have a conversation
210
Appendix D.
Utterances for Metaphorical Analysis
with Secretary DeVos about.
Something that she’s made clear and
it’s unfortunate that we haven’t been able to have this conversation
sooner because it was held up for so long but I think that’s something
that Secretary DeVos will be speaking a lot about, about the educa-
tion funding and skillset and opportunities that we give not just our
children but people older in life who are looking to get back into the
workforce through another avenue.
(27)
Roberta,
as you referenced the statement last night,
we are disap-
pointed that Republicans turned this into a political exercise.
This is
a conference report that doesn’t look like it can even pass the United
States Senate. But if it did, and the President was presented with the
bill, he would veto it.
And let me explain why.First of all, it’s woe-
fully inadequate.
Our public health professionals estimate that the
federal government needs $1.9 billion of funding to attack this emer-
gency.
This bill falls far short of that.
This is a bill that would also
steal money from other critically important public health priorities,
including those funded by the Aﬀordable Care Act and those funded
by our eﬀort to combat Ebola.
So at the end of the day, this bill does
not provide adequate funding.Third, this bill unfortunately includes
an ideological rider blocking access to contraception for women in
the U.S., including those in Puerto Rico, even though Zika is a sex-
ually transmitted disease and even though it has been transmitted
in Puerto Rico.
It makes no sense.
I’d also draw your attention to
provision in this bill that guts some provisions of the Clean Water
Act.
So for those reasons, the President would veto this bill if it ever
got to his desk.
Again I haven’t seen much analysis that suggests it
could even pass the United States Senate.
And for that reason,
we
urge Republicans to stop turning this into a political football, to ac-
tually get to work, and come up with a proposal that’s going to serve
the American people.
(28)
Well, Julie, I quibble with some parts of your question, namely that
D.3.
Conventional Metaphors
211
there wasn’t much to show for the legislative eﬀort.
If you recall,
there was a lot of independent reporting and analysis that getting the
United States Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform in a
bipartisan way was a far-fetched prediction. It turns out Republicans
and Democrats were able to roll up their sleeves and work together
on one of the most challenging and complex issues of our time.
So I
do think that that was an important milestone to show that compre-
hensive immigration reform isn’t just common sense, it isn’t just the
right thing to do consistent with American values, it’s not just widely
supported by wide swaths of the American people, but it’s also leg-
islatively doable. Unfortunately, House Republicans, for reasons still
unclear, refuse to call that bill up for even a vote.So you’re right, leg-
islatively there still remains a lot of work to do.
That’s why the Pres-
ident was clear that the best way to ﬁx to address this problem is
going to be through comprehensive immigration reform.
The Pres-
ident was also clear that that’s unlikely to happen in this Congress,
and that’s why he expects a debate amongst the American people on
the best pathway forward.The other, I think, answer to your question
is, there does remain additional work that the President has done on
this issue that remains in place,
and that,
as Justin referenced,
in-
cludes the DACA program announced in the summer of 2012.
At
the time, the President announced that our lowest priorities for en-
forcement were these diligent, patriotic young DREAMers who grew
up pledging allegiance to the ﬂag, and that they should be able to ap-
ply to work, study and pay their taxes here.
Since then, more than
730,000 people have come out of the shadows and their lives have
been changed as a result.
Fortunately, today’s decision doesn’t aﬀect
those people.
I’d also say, it’s one of the reason why comprehensive
immigration reform has such wide support. You’ve got support from
the evangelical community.
You’ve got support from business lead-
ers, from law enforcement, obviously from the Hispanic community,
from unions.
So you see wide and diverse constituency groups sup-

their hands and doing nothing about it.
