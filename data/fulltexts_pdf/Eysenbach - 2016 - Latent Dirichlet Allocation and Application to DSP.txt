Introduction
LDA[1]
is a canonical
example of a mixed-membership model,
and it has been applied in a number of
fields.
In this project, we
1
implement an variational inference algorithm for LDA and use LDA to model
a large dataset of academic papers.
2
Implementing LDA
The first part of this project focused on implementing the variational inference algorithm in the original
LDA paper.
The goal was to produce a functional and comprehensible implementation.
Learning C++
was a convenient side effect.
We did not optimize for performance.
2.1
Hyperparameter Optimization
Implementing the updates to hyperparameter α was challenging because of a typo in section A.4.2 of the
original LDA paper.
The log-likelihood is maximized w.r.t α using Newton’s Method, which requires the
second derivative of the log-likelihood w.r.t α.
The correct derivatives are shown below, with differences
highlighted in green.

Simple Experiments with LDA
Next, we tested our implementation on two small datasets.
We originally planned to use the TREC AP
news corpus and C Elegans abstract corpus from the original LDA paper.
Unfortunately, we were unable
to acquire these datasets.
Instead, we used a dataset of music articles from the New York Times[3] and
business news from Reuters[13].

All work was completed individually.

Top words for two topics in Reuters (right).
As a sanity check,
we computed the negative log-likelihood for each iteration and confirmed that
they converged.
This is shown in Fig.
1 (left and center).
Note how quickly the algorithm converges,
even when plotted in log-scale.
We also computed the top words each topic.
Fig.
1 (right) shows the
top words for topics 13 and 8.
The first topic relates to business revenues,
while the second relates to
government regulation and agriculture.

Log-likelihood with random initializations
Random initialization was important to our variation inference algorithm.
As shown in Fig.
2,
we
achieved the highest log-likelihood when we randomly initialized all
the variational
parameters.
We
found this surprising given that the original LDA paper called for a fixed initialization of φ and γ.
We
hypothesize that random initialization helps break symmetry.
We also found that removing stopwords
was also important for breaking symmetry between topics.

DSPACE
3.1
Collecting Data
The next part of the project applied LDA to a dataset of academic papers.
The MIT Libraries manage
DSPACE,
3
a digital
repository of papers written by MIT affiliates.
We scraped this website to gather
the following metadata for 100,906 papers:
authors, title, department and abstract.
We have made this
metadata dataset publicly available.
4
3.2
Algorithm
With this data, we wanted to recover the underlying topics of each paper by applying LDA to the paper
abstracts.
Given the size of
these data (11,299,213 words) we opted to use an optimized,
parallelized
implemtation of Online LDA [7]
provided by Gensim [6].
We used this implementation on our dataset
of DSPACE abstracts to learn a topic model with 50 topics.
It converged after three iterations through
the dataset.

“yeutter” refers to Clayton Keith Yeutter, the Secretary of Agriculture under George H. W. Bush.

3.3
Evaluating Learnt Topics
Both the model
and the learning algorithm we used are approximations.
Whether they are useful
de-
pends on the task at hand.
Because we are not interested in any particular task,
we used “semantic
meaningfulness” of the learnt topics as a proxy for usefulness.
We evaluated the learnt topics by com-
puting the top words and documents for each topic and by visualizing the geometry of the topic latent
space.
Topic 2 - Supply Chains
Topic 22 - Climate Change
Topic 26 - Air Pollution
Topic 30 - Chemistry

Figure 3:
Top words for each topic
First,
we computed the most likely words for each topic by examining the rows of
the β matrix.
Fig.
3 shows the top words for six chosen topics.
Column titles such as “Supply Chains” were written
manually;
they were not output by the algorithm.
Note that the words within each topic are specific,
but the six topics themselves are different.
Next, we computed the top documents for each topic.
For some topic i, we sorted the documents by
the probability each belongs to topic i.
Fig.
5 shows the titles of these top documents.
The selected
topics are the same as in Fig.
3.
As before, notice that each topic appears well defined yet distinct.
Note
that the learning algorithm did not have access to the document titles during training.
These two figures demonstrate that LDA learns meaningful topics for this dataset.
However, they do
not reveal relationships between topics.
3.4
Visualization
LDA posits that each document is a mixture over topics.
We expect that semantically similar documents
have “close” topic proportions.
Unfortunately, human eyes are two dimensional while these distributions
over topics are too-many
5
dimensional
(k = 50).
We explored two approaches to constructing a low
dimensional visualization:
Johnson Lindenstrauss and TSNE.
Johnson Lindenstrauss[9] is an approach to reducing the dimension of data while preserving pairwise
distances.
The proof
of
correctness is usually stated using L2 norms.
We attempted to adopt the
approach to the symmetrized KL norm.
After many failed attempts,
we found a paper proving that it
is impossible to use Johnson Lindenstrauss with the symmetrized KL norm to achieve a low-distortion
embedding.[5]
TSNE[4]
is another method for computing a low dimensional
embedding while preserving pairwise
distances.
6
Unlike Johnson Lindenstrauss,
the embedding is nonlinear and does not have the same
correctness properties.
Nonetheless, it has been used successfully in a number of settings (e.g.
[10], [11],
[12]).
We applied TSNE to a random sample of 5,000 papers, as shown in Fig.
4.
In that figure, each dot
corresponds to a paper, and the color of the dot indicates the department in which paper was published.
Recall that the learning algorithm did not have access to these department labels during training.
Titles
of documents from three circled clusters in Fig.
4 are shown in Fig.
6.
Similar to the topics shown in
Fig.
5, these clusters appear well defined yet distinct from one another.
We had hoped that documents published in the same department would be clustered in this em-
bedding.
While Fig.
4 shows some clustering by department,
the departments are more mixed than
anticipated.
This result is not entirely surprising given the number of interdepartmental faculty and labs
at MIT.
3.5
Clustering Authors
The DSPACE dataset we collected can be used not only for discovering document topics,
but also for
clustering authors.
We propose (but do not implement) two methods for this task.
5
Pun intended.
6
We tested both the symmetrized KL and L2 distance in TSNE.
Surprisingly,
the symmetrized KL failed to form
meaningful clusters.
Fig.
4 uses L2.

Figure 4:
Embedding of papers by learnt topics
The first method takes a frequentist approach.
Let C(i) denote the corpus of
papers written by
author i and γ(d) be the distribution over topics assigned by LDA to document d.
Then define the
distance between authors i and j as
d(i, j) =
1
|C(i)||C(j)|
X
d
i
∈C(i)
X
d
j
∈C(j)
KL
symm
(γ(d
i
), γ(d
j
))
Applying this distance metric to each pair of
authors defines a graph over authors.
We can then
model the graph using techniques such as Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Models [8].
The second method takes a fully Bayesian approach.
We extend the LDA model to include author-
specific distributions over topics Θ
i
in addition to a global distribution over topics Θ.
We also include a
prior over authors π.
Specifically, we define the following generative model:
1.
Choose N ∼ P oisson(ξ)
2.
Choose Θ ∼ Dir(α), a global distribution over topics
3.
Choose π ∼ Dir(β), a distribution over authors.
4.
For each author i, choose Θ
i
∼ Dir(Θ).
5.
For each of N words w
n
:
(a) Choose author i ∼ M ultinomial(π).
(b) Choose topic z
n
∼ M ultinomial(Θ
i
)
(c) Choose word w
n
∼ P (w
n
|z
n
, β)
The first method is convenient given a model
already fit to your corpus.
The second method is
more computationally intensive,
but will better capture the variance of cluster assignments.
While the
methods described above are aimed at assigning authors to topics, they can be applied directly to other
document attributes, such as department or year of publication.

Conclusion
The goal of this project was to better understand LDA and mixed membership models.
We achieved this
goal by implementing a variational inference algorithm for LDA and applying LDA to a large dataset of
academic papers.
Finally, we proposed a method for extending LDA to clustering authors.
