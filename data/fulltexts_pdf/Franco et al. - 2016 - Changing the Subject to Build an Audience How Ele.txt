Abstract
The constitution guarantees citizens the right to petition their elected officials
and constituent communication is a central feature of many theories of repre-
sentation.
Yet, little is known about what constituents say and why they raise
particular issues.
Using an original data set of constituent communication, we
show that even though much of constituents’ communication to Congressional
offices follows the ebbs and flows of trending national policy debates, members
of Congress are able to affect the topics about which citizens write.
We demon-
strate representatives’ ability to create an audience for particular topics using
an extensive dataset of over 2.7 million public posts and comments made on
elected officials’ Facebook Pages.
Using text as data methods and a research
design to limit potential
confounders,
we show that some legislators appeal
to citizens interested in local
political
issues and discourage those interested
in nationally trending controversies, a result with important implications for
political representation.

The first amendment to the US constitution guarantees the right “to petition the
Government for a redress of grievances”.
The right to contact elected officials has
evolved into a regularly used form of political participation:
organized campaigns to
write Congress are a prominent component of contemporary political activism.
And
it also constitutes a major component of
contemporary political
science theories
of
representation.
Political
scientists argue that constituent communication is a
central feature of how representation occurs and use a variety of experimental designs
to examine the determinants of legislators’
response to constituent communication
(Mansbridge, 2003; Broockman, 2014).
In spite of the central place in representation as practiced and studied, political
scientists know remarkably little about what constituents say to their elected offi-
cials and why they choose to discuss particular issues.
This paper seeks to address
the paucity of evidence by providing a novel systematic analysis of what the public
says when they interact with elected officials.
We show that when the public com-
municates with elected officials it tends to discuss salient political topics.
And when
discussing issues of
national
importance,
we also find a surprising balance in the
sentiment directed towards elected officials.
In spite of the wide-ranging unpopular-
ity of Congress, we find that the public often heaps praise on their elected officials,
while also occasionally lobbing vitriolic attacks on legislators.
We demonstrate that,
surprisingly,
elected officials are more than just passive
recipients of communication from constituents.
Rather,
elected officials shape who
participates in the conversations—with elected officials able to exert a direct and
measurable effect on the number of messages received, who sends those messages, and
the content of constituents’ messages.
We show that when elected officials comment
on salient political debates they invite messages from the public that are qualitatively
different than when elected officials broadcast work they have completed in their
districts.
Further, when elected officials make a statement on a particular topic they
direct conversation towards that issue, causing a sharp increase in discussion around
2
that issue.
To examine the content of
constituent communication we use a new data set
of
over 2.7 million public posts and comments made by constituents on Facebook
Pages of elected officials, along with a corresponding collection of posts from elected
officials.
We show that the content of communication on Facebook is quite useful for
studying how constituents communicate with elected officials generally.
Contrasting
survey data with information about who posts on elected officials’ Facebook Pages,
we show that the kinds of
people who write to their elected officials on Facebook
are similar in demographics and socioeconomic status to survey respondents who
report contacting elected officials using more traditional
means.
Further,
we show
that the issues discussed with elected officials on Facebook track broad national
debates,
evidence that Facebook users are not merely communicating about niche
topics distinct from the issues constituents are likely to raise with offices.
Our study
builds on recent analyses of other social media websites (Barbera et al., 2014), while
facilitating a more direct analysis of how elected officials and the public communicate
with each other.
Our evidence provides a new motivation for why elected officials facilitate con-
stituent communication.
Democratic theorists usually argue that constituent com-
munication is a valuable tool for constituents to hold their elected officials account-
able or worry about particular groups exercising a disproportionate influence on
Congressional offices (Mansbridge, 2003; Kalla and Broockman, 2014).
This concern
is valid if legislators use communication to take a biased sample of opinion from their
district.
Yet, legislators might also be able to improve their standing with those who
contact their office.
For example, Grose, Malhotra and Van Houweling (2015) show
that elected officials are able to effectively react to messages from constituents and
improve support after constituents write letters to legislative offices.
To this end,
we show that constituent communication provides elected officials the opportunity
to affect the kinds of
messages their office receives and,
potentially,
the types of
3
responses legislators are able to articulate to constituents.
Communication between
elected officials and their constituents, then, is a valuable tool for elected officials to
cultivate support from constituents and to create an audience around issues.
Not
only are elected officials motivated to prompt constituency service requests (Cain,
Ferejohn and Fiorina, 1987), they are also motivated to prompt policy messages on
electorally advantageous issues.

Why Representatives
Can Influence the Vol-
ume and Content of
Constituent Communica-
tion
Constituent communication–the act of citizens contacting their elected officials and
the elected officials’
subsequent response—is an essential
feature of
political
rep-
resentation.
Normative theories of
representation argue that communication be-
tween elected officials and constituents constitutes a crucial
connection (Rehfeld,
2009).
Indeed,
deliberative theories of
representation argue that this communica-
tion is necessary for effective representation to occur (Gutmann and Thompson,
1996;
Mansbridge,
2003).
According to these theories,
the views that constituents
express to elected officials provide a critical conduit between citizens’ priorities and
the actions of elected officials while in office (Mansbridge, 1999, 2003).
While scholars have studied many features of constituent communication,
little
is known about what
constituents say to their elected officials.
Instead,
studies of
constituent communication have provided insights into the causes and consequences
of any contact with a representative’s office.
For example,
several
studies examine
how descriptive representation affects constituents’
propensity to contact legisla-
tive offices (For example,Gay 2002;
Broockman 2014) or how individual
citizens’
own resources affect their ability to contact elected officials (Verba, Schlozman and
4
Brady,
1995).
Other studies examine when and how Congressional
offices respond
to messages constructed in an experimental setting (Butler, 2014), how constituents
evaluate the content of responses from Congressional
offices (Grose,
Malhotra and
Van Houweling,
2015),
and how constituents respond after being experimentally
invited to Congressional town halls (Minozzi et al., 2015).
Implicit
in much of
the literature on constituent
communication and popu-
lar press discussion thereof
is a standard model
of
constituent communication—a
model
that supposes elected official
are passive recipients of
communication from
constituents.
Under this model
of communication,
constituents (or interest groups
of citizens) initiate communication with elected officials, who decide how to respond
to the messages they receive.
For example,
the civic voluntarism model
supposes
that citizens’
propensity to contact elected officials is a function of
the citizens’
own socioeconomic resources, time constraints, and whether they had been asked to
participate (Verba et al.,
1995).
The same basic assumption that constituents (or
interest groups of constituents) initiate the communication process is implicit in a
large experimental
literature about legislator responsiveness to constituent service
requests, where the type of message sent to an office is assumed to be typical across
legislative offices and not a function of the diverse ways elected officials might rep-
resent their constituents (Butler and Broockman,
2011;
Butler,
2014).
Given the
messages, elected officials are often assumed to use the information as a biased poll
of their district, to decide on what to work on (Kalla and Broockman, 2014) or how
to vote on particular bills (Bergan and Cole, 2015).
When the existing literature does provide a role for legislators to influence the
audience for constituent communication,
the influence is not based on attributes
within the individual legislator’s discretion.
For example, immutable characteristics
can affect the kinds of people who contact a legislative office.
Constituents who are
represented descriptively are more likely to contact their elected officials,
in part
because descriptive representation boosts trust between constituents and legislators
5
(Gay,
2002;
Mansbridge,
1999;
Broockman,
2014).
Another mechanism is that the
increasingly complex and expansive role of government may encourage constituents
to contact their elected officials (Cain,
Ferejohn and Fiorina,
1987).
While on the
margin individual elected officials can do little to affect the kinds of problems their
constituents will
encounter as they navigate governmental
bureaucracy,
elected of-
ficials can advertise the availability of services.
And other literatures suppose that
presidents can increase the incidence of constituent communication to Congressional
offices (Canes-Wrone, 2006), but that members of Congress are passive recipients of
the messages their office receives.
Certainly citizens can and do contact elected officials without other encourage-
ment.
But building on the insights into constituent communication in prior work, we
argue that representatives have both the incentive and capacity to exercise poten-
tially subtle influence on the types of constituents who contact their office and the
kinds of comments those constituents leave.
Elected officials have incentive because
engaging with constituents creates opportunities for elected officials to bolster their
electoral
support.
When representatives interact with constituents in town halls
they are able to affect the likelihood those constituents will
vote for their elected
official
(Minozzi
et al.,
2015).
Outside of
town halls representatives can respond
to constituents’
letters to the office with explanations that create support among
constituents (Grose, Malhotra and Van Houweling, 2015).
Elected officials have more than an incentive to just interact with constituents,
they have an incentive to interact with constituents on a specific set of issues.
This
is because many representatives have issues on which they are better suited for cul-
tivating their constituents’ support.
For example,
elected officials tend to focus on
issues that are important to their constituency to cultivate local support (Grimmer,
Westwood and Messing, 2014) or will avoid issues that highlight disagreement with
constituents (Grimmer,
2013).
Other elected officials may want to establish a rep-
utation as a leader in a policy area and interacting with concerned individuals on
6
those areas may help cultivate that reputation.
Elected officials also have the capacity to affect the agenda for their interactions
with constituents.
This is because representatives often go out of their way to struc-
ture how they communicate with constituents.
For example, consider how members
of Congress advertise their town halls.
In a July 2009 press release,
Jay Inslee (D-
WA) announced that he was “hosting a telephone town hall meeting tonight so he
can speak with his constituents about the health care reform bill” (Inslee,
2009).
Similarly,
Michelle Bachmann announced in a newsletter to constituents that she
“will be hosting two forums on the cap and trade policies that have been introduced
in the Obama budget proposal
and in the U.S.
Congress.
Cap and trade,
which
would more appropriately be labeled an energy tax, makes energy producers pay to
emit carbon emissions in hopes of
reducing greenhouse gases” (Bachmann,
2009).
This is indicative of
how members of
Congress announce their town halls.
In a
sample of press releases and newsletters,
66% of town hall
announcements focused
on a specific topic.
1
In other communication, representatives also solicit constituent
opinion about specific topics.
For example legislators will regularly ask constituents
to express an opinion about a specific issue in a newsletter.
Even outside of town
halls and e-newsletters, legislators can craft a reputation as effective on particularly
policy areas and this can lead to increased communication from citizens on that area
(Grimmer, 2013).
The result of the explicit and implicit actions is that elected officials can exercise
influence over who decides to make a contact, nudging constituents with a particular
issue interest to contact the office.
Rather than persuade the same individuals to
comment about different issues, we argue that legislators cultivate an audience with
constituents who view a particular set of issues as important.
This is important for
1
To calculate this number we used a collection of House press releases and e-newsletters from
House and Senate offices.
We identified newsletters that used the phrases, town hall, open house,
or forum at least once.
We then coded the statements as about a town hall or not and if about a
town hall about a specific topic or not.
Our replication file includes all of our coding decisions and
corresponding texts.

representatives, because it provides the elected officials the opportunity to increase
the frequency their office interacts with constituents who are most likely to have
a positive experience.
They can encourage statements and inquiries from interest
groups where the legislator is active or prompt the public to discuss issues where
the elected official
has an advantageous position.
Elected officials can cultivate an
audience with constituents who feel
strongly about an issue or with constituents
who are likely to agree with decisions the representative has recently made.
We are not arguing that legislators exercise complete control over the agenda in
constituent communication or who contacts the office.
Rather, we argue that, on the
margin, representatives are able to exercise an effect on the kind of messages that are
sent to the office.
The result of this process, we argue, is that it creates conditions
where elected officials are able to use constituent communication to bolster support
among constituents.

Why Facebook Data Are Useful
for Studying
Political Communication
While a great deal
of
work has been allocated to studying the consequences of
communication,
little is actually known about what constituents say when they
communicate with their representative and elected officials’
role in shaping that
communication.
This is because of
a lack of
access to data and methodological
struggles in analyzing those data.
Little is known, in part, because elected officials
are reluctant to release information about what constituents say to the office.
Elected
officials are reluctant because they both want to protect constituents who reveal
potentially sensitive information when writing to their representative and to protect
the elected officials themselves who are often reluctant to release information that
shows their actions contradict the expressed opinion of
their constituents.
And
even if scholars were able to gain access to the communication, the large number of
8
messages constituents send to their legislators poses a problem for standard modes
of analyzing large collections of text.
To circumvent the obstacles that have limited the study of constituent commu-
nication, we analyze over 2.7 million public posts made to elected officials’ Facebook
Pages from May to August of 2015.
This includes all
the posts from House mem-
bers,
senators,
governors,
and a subset of
large-city mayors,
along with all
subse-
quent comments made to the elected officials’
Pages.
The result is a collection of
communication that captures the views that are expressed at elected officials.
Our
analysis offers a distinct contribution while complementing other analyses of social
media.
For example,
Barbera et al.
(2014) analyze what individuals who follow
elected officials say on twitter, along with elected officials’ statements.
This analysis
is important, but by design cannot provide insights into the information that elected
officials receive from social media posts.
2
Our analysis also builds on survey work on communication with Congressional
offices (Cain,
Ferejohn and Fiorina,
1987;
Hickey,
2013).
Previous scholarship has
examined self-reported contacts of Congressional offices to understand who contacts
the offices.
This provides insights into the characteristics of
people who contact
Congressional offices and self-reported reasons for why they contact the office.
Un-
fortunately,
though,
these self reports provide little information into what individ-
uals actually say to their elected officials.
Our posts from elected officials’
Pages,
however, can provide this information.
While we might be concerned that the individuals who contact elected officials
on Facebook are distinct from the population that contacts elected officials through
other mechanisms, Figures 1 and 2 suggest that the two populations are similar.
To
compare the two populations we use a self-reported measure of contacting a Con-
gressional
office from the 2006 Cooperative Congressional
Election Study (CCES)
and attributes of the Facebook commenters (Ansolabehere, 2013; Hickey, 2013).
For
2
That would require either obtaining the list of accounts the office follows or, more directly, an
analysis of the tweets directed at an elected official.

example, the age distribution of survey respondents who contacted their government
representatives (henceforth “contactors”) and Facebook users who comment on their
representatives’
Pages (henceforth “commenters”) is similar.
In both populations,
we see a roughly normal
distribution centered around 65 years of
age,
where the
median age for contactors is 60 and the median age of commenters is 57.
Thus, they
conform to the general finding that people who contact their representatives tend to
be older adults (Verba et al.,
1995;
Hickey,
2013).
The gender breakdown of both
populations is also similar.
For the most part, men communicate with their represen-
tives more than women, but while contactors are only slightly more male than female
(50.4% male, 49.6% female), commenters are more male by a clearer margin (53.8%
male, 46.2% female).
A greater difference between contactors and commenters may
be in education level.
It is well known that people who contact their representatives
tend to be highly educated (Verba, Schlozman and Brady, 1995; Cain, Ferejohn and
Fiorina, 1987; Hickey, 2013) , and that finding is clearly replicated in both contactor
and commenter populations.
Among contactors, 38.2% ended their education with
high school, 45.0% with college, and 16.8% with grad school.
Facebook commenters,
however, tend even more highly educated, where 20.5% of commenters ended their
education with high school,
66.5% have finished college,
and 13.0% have finished
grad school.
Still, in both populations the vast majority of people have finished col-
lege or graduate school.
Thus, we have good reason to believe that the people who
contact their elected officials on Facebook are representative of people who contact
their representatives through any available means.
Certainly,
we might be concerned that the particular way Facebook facilitates
communication between representative and constituent might lead to results that are
too distinct to be useful for understanding constituent communication generally.
We
might suspect that the communicative context and structure specific to Facebook
would be very different from traditional letter-writing, email, and phone campaigns.
The evidence in this section,
however,
suggests that the people who communicate
10
Figure 1:

hand plot) have similar age distributions
Figure 2:

hand plots) have similar gender and education distributions
11
with their representative on Facebook are demographically similar to the people who
contact their representative on Facebook.
And, constiuent communication currently
takes many forms and increasingly the views expressed on social
media are a key
component of how elected officials learn about the views’ of the public.
Although Facebook constituent communication might not have the same features
as letter-writing, it strongly resembles town halls—where elected officials are able to
explicitly set an agenda to influence the kinds of comments and questions they receive
from the public, but are also subject to whatever arbitrary question might arise from
whomever decided to attend a particular meeting.
Elected officials’ Facebook Pages,
then, constitute a continuous and online town hall for the elected official.
The result
is that Facebook Pages provide a location for us to observe the sorts of
messages
that constituents send to their elected officials.
3
Learning the Topics and Tone of Conversation
Using the posts made on elected officials’
Pages,
we are able to provide a first of
its kind analysis of the issues constituents raise when communicating with elected
officials and the tone of those comments.
In this section we perform a comprehensive
analysis of over 2.7 million posts and demonstrate that Facebook commenters are
surprisingly focused on issues and generally avoid vitriol and trolling.
To make this
discovery, we take two complementary approaches to analyzing communication be-
tween elected officials and constituents.
Our first approach is to use an unsupervised
model,
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA),
to automatically generate a set of
cate-
gories that provide a granular view of what is discussed on elected officials’
Pages.
We also analyze the posts using a supervised approach—a methodology where we
set the categories before hand and then uses a statistical model to efficiently classify
all the posts.
To quantitatively model
our texts,
we first represent the texts as a document
12
term matrix.
To do this, we follow a series of steps that takes texts and turns them
into count vectors, where each component of the count vector counts the number of
times the particular feature occurs (Grimmer and Stewart,
2013).
In our case,
we
discard stop words, remove punctuation, discard word order, and maintain the most
common unigrams (single words),
bigrams (pairs of
words),
and trigrams (triples
of
words).
We use this representation of
the text for both the unsupervised and
supervised model.
We first apply a topic model
to our text collection.
Topic models are a broad class
of
models that encode problem-specific structure into an estimation of
categories
(Blei, Ng and Jordan 2003; see Blei 2012 for a comprehensive review).
Topic models
share two broad characteristics.
The first is a definition of
a topic.
Statistically,
a topic is a probability mass function over features.
Each component of
a topic
describes the probability a particular feature (a unigram, bigram, or trigram) is used
when discussing that topic.
Substantively,
topics characterize distinct substantive
issues that could be discussed on legislators’ Pages.
In constituent communication,
one topic may convey attention to Police Violence, with a high probability attached
to words like guns, prayers, police, and kill.
A second topic may discuss the
Planned Parenthood debate, regularly using words like care, health, children,
women, and insurance.
To estimate a topic,
the models use the co-occurrence of
words across documents.
Critically, the model determines the topic from the data,
rather than us imposing the topic as the analyst.
Second,
a topic model
assumes
that posts are a mixture of the topics.
We apply LDA to over 2.7 million Facebook posts and comments on U.S. elected
officials’ public Pages collected over a 90-day period in the late summer to fall of 2015.
Given the large number of posts, standard implementations of LDA will struggle to
analyze the collection of posts.
Therefore, we use an online version of LDA (Hoffman,
Bach and Blei, 2010), as implemented in
ˇ
Reh˚uˇrek and Sojka (2010).
Table 1 shows
13
the results of applying the online-LDA algorithm,
when set to 25 topics.
3
The 25
topics we analyzed our represented in Table 1 below.
The first column provides a
topic number for each topic,
the second column represents a manually generated
topic label, the third column represents stems that are indicative of the words that
represent the particular topic, and the four column represents the proportion of all
documents composed of that topic.
Table 1 shows that there is a great deal of substantive discussion on elected of-
ficials’
Pages.
Many of the topics are recent policy debates;
they encompass posts
about bills currently being discussed in Congress and political
issues made promi-
nent by current events.
These topics are high volume and temporally ephemeral.
Over this 3-month period, the primary campaign for the 2016 Presidential Election,
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Police violence/Gun Control, the Confederate
Flag, the Iran Nuclear Deal, and Planned Parenthood were salient topics.
The TPP
is an excellent example of a bill
under discussion in Congress.
In the late summer
to fall
of 2015,
the TPP was heavily debated in both houses,
and support for the
bill become a controversial issue, especially among Democrats.
Thousands of Face-
book users utilized their representatives’
Pages to express opinions about the bill.
Planned Parenthood is an example of a longstanding issue (abortion rights) made
temporarily more prominent by current events.
In the late summer when a series of
videos were released featuring aborted fetuses and suggesting that Planned Parent-
hood was selling aborted fetal tissue to scientific researchers, outrage erupted among
the Pro-life community.
And this outrage made its mark on legislators’
Facebook
Pages with a barrage of comments.
By the early fall, the House of Representatives
introduced a bill and voted to defund Planned Parenthood for one year, a series of
events that led to even more constituent comments about Planned Parenthood.
Some of our topics are political issues that tend to divide the two parties.
The
3
25-topics was chosen because it balances a less useful coarse representation of the texts with a
more granular, but repetitive, larger number of topics.
Note that we’ve normalized the documents
to sum to 1, while the output from gensim will round down to zero when a topic drops below the
threshold.
Our results throughout hold whether we normalize the topics or not.
14
most prominent ones in the Summer to Fall
of
2015 include Family issues,
Busi-
ness/Economy,
Local
issues,
the Education to Employment pipeline,
Civil
Rights,
Tax Policy, Immigration, Democratic Leaders, Veterans’ Affairs, the Environment/Energy,
and Government Waste.
Some issues tend to unify most partisans from both parties–
such as honoring the military and veterans or local issues/constituent services.
Oth-
ers,
however,
are issues that are consistently prominent because of
their role in
defining citizens’ partisan identities–such as Tax policy or the Minimum wage.
Finally,
some of our topics convey an expression of sentiment or anger.
A por-
tion of these expressions might be what most people imagine when they think about
politics on social media–“trolling” and, more generally, an expression of vitriol.
But
surprisingly, there is more positive or neutral sentiment than there is negative sen-
timent on politicians’
Facebook Pages.
The positive mentions includes Personal
Praise directed at government representatives or members of the community, praise
for certain pieces of
legislation,
and informed debate of
political
issues and legis-
lation.
Commonly,
constituents tell
their representatives they are doing a great
job and thank them for voting in a way they find agreeable.
Negative expressions
of sentiment include Vitriolic attacks,
most commonly on the Affordable Care Act
and abortion rights, criticism of Democratic leaders and policies from Republicans,
expressions of
frustration with a stalled and broken Congress,
and Conservative
outrage over liberal policy proposals like the Dream Act and institutions associated
with the left, such as Planned Parenthood.
Comments related to Legislative Praise,
Legislative Debate,
and Family Issues were the most common,
and comments on
Planned Parenthood,
Personal
Messages,
and Conservative Outrage were the least
common.
The topics in Table 1 provide a useful and specific portrayal of what is discussed
on legislators’ Pages.
To complement the topic model organization of texts, we im-
plement a supervised coding procedure that provides a more coarse organization of
the posts.
We apply two distinctive organizations of
the texts.

the subject of
posts from elected officials and comments from the public,
placing
all elected officials and the public’s posts into three categories:
national, local, and
not applicable.
We define a post about a (1) national issue if it discusses a national
policy issue,
debate,
or holiday.
A post is (2) local
if
it discusses a local
policy
issue or debate or the legislator specifically.
The (3) not applicable category covers
the few instances where a post is made that is nonsensical.
We also examine the
tone (sentiment) of what is said on elected officials’ Pages.
We classify the public’s
comments into three categories:
attack, neutral, or praise.
An (1) attack is a direct
statement meant to impugn the elected official.
A (2) praise post is a direct compli-
ment or expression of gratitude to an elected official, and (3) a post is neutral if it
16
neither attacks nor praises the elected official.
Using our straightforward coding rules, we hand coded a separate training set for
elected officials’
subject (2000 posts hand classified) and constituents’
subject and
tone (4000 posts hand classified).
We then train a classifier using LASSO and ten-
fold cross validation to select the model complexity penalty (Hastie, Tibshirani and
Friedman,
2001).
4
We assign documents to a particular category by choosing the
category with the highest probability.
Cross-validating our entire procedure yields
an accuracy of
75% for the topic of
elected officials’
posts,
63% accuracy for the
topic of the public’s posts, and 66.25% for the tone of the public’s posts.
When the public writes on elected officials’
Pages,
they discuss a wide variety
of issues—not just issues of salient national importance.
In total, 52% of the posts
from elected officials are about national
issues.
This is highest for members of
Congress and lowest for governors and mayors.
Senators write 61% of their posts
about national
issues,
while 58% of posts from House members are about national
issues.
Governors and mayors allocate 41% and 30% of their posts to national issues,
respectively.
Posts from the public have a similar covariation with office.
Overall 56% of posts
made on elected officials’ Pages are about national issues,
but 64% of the posts on
senators’ Pages and 59% of the posts on house members’ Pages are about national
issues.
In contrast,
32% of
the posts on mayors Pages and 46% of
the posts to
governors are about national issues.
The tone of posts is also less vitriolic than the stereotypical portrayal of conver-
sation on the internet.
Overall, only 5% of posts explicitly attack the elected official,
while 12% of posts praise representatives.
Attacks are more common for members
of Congress and governors than for mayors:
7.1% of posts on senators’ Pages, 5.5%
4
LASSO is essentially a linear regression with a penalty on coefficient magnitude to avoid
overfitting.
To determine a document’s category we fit a series of
binary regressions and then
selected the category with the highest probability.
An alternative procedure would include the
margin in our training set, which yields a very similar set of classifications.
Both procedures are a
generalization of Na¨ıve Bayes, where the generalization is that we do not assume the features are
independent.
17
of
posts on governors Pages,
and 4.7% of
posts on House members Pages are at-
tacks,
while only 2.8% of posts on mayors’
Pages are attacks.
Praise is also more
common for mayors and governors than members of
Congress:
18.3% of
posts on
mayor’s Pages and 18% of posts on governor’s Pages are praise, while 11.2% of posts
to House members’
Pages and 9.2% of
posts to senators’
Pages praise the elected
official.
We can assess the validity of
our tone coding a second way:
using a count of
“vulgar” language in posts that come from commentors.
Specifically, we use a com-
prehensive list of swear words to examine the relationship between our automated
codings of commentors’ posts and incidence of swear words on posts made on elected
officials’ Pages.
This reveals a strong relationship between attacks on elected officials
and the use of swear words:
when there are a higher proportion of comments that
attack legislators, there is also a higher count of swear words.
A 10 percentage point
increase in attacks on an elected official
is associated with an additional
1.2 swear
words in the comment thread.
Analyzed a different way, comment threads that have
a higher rate of attacks also have a higher probability that at least one comment has
a swear word.
A 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of attacking posts
is associated with a 6.7 percentage point increase in the probability a comment has
a swear word,
and a higher rate of swear words per comment (1.8 percent increase
in the rate swear words are used).
Not surprisingly, praising statements have a very
different relationship with swear words—further confirmatory evidence for the va-
lidity of
our automated codes.
A 10 percentage point increase in comments that
praise an elected official
is associated with 0.24 fewer swear words throughout the
comment, a 2.3 percentage point reduction in probability at least one comment uses
a swear word, and a 5 percent reduction in the rate swear words are used.

How Elected Officials Shape The Focus and Tone
of Constituent Communication
The previous section demonstrated,
for the first time,
that a large share of
the
communication elected officials receive from constituents is focused on issues,
with
only a small
share of content vitriolic or trolling.
Using the collection of messages
from elected officials’ Facebook Pages and our automated codings, we now examine
how elected officials affect the types of comments they receive.
Given the structure
of Pages on Facebook, we examine the total reaction to elected officials’ statements
and how the content of what politicians post affects what the kinds of messages left
on their Page.
As we have argued above, this structure mirrors how elected officials
facilitate other communication with constituents,
such as the question and answer
dynamic in a town hall.
Elected officials, through the types of messages they post, are able to affect the
volume of
messages they receive on their Page.
This is evident in Table 2,
which
shows that when politicians post on national
issues—coded using the supervised
learning classification from the previous section—they increase the traffic to their
Page.
In Column 1 we show that the typical response to a post on a national topic
results in 24.8 more comments in response (95-percent confidence interval
[21.76,
27.83]).
Of course,
a concern with all
of these relationships is that characteristics
of
the politician— such as level
of
office,
ideology,
or national
popularity—could
confound our results.
To mitigate the effect of these and other time-invariant con-
founders we examine the relationship while also including legislator fixed effects.
The second column shows that the large increase in total
responses to a post re-
mains, with a post on a national topic resulting in 19.2 more comments (95-percent
confidence interval [16.36, 22.04]).
Likewise, when legislators engage in a topic that
is salient with constituents they receive more attention.
We measure the trending
of rank of each topic from Table 1 each hour,
ranking the topics from 1,
the most
19
salient, to 25, the least salient, and then assess the effect of posting on that topic in
the subsequent hour.
The fourth column shows that, after conditioning on fixed ef-
fects, posting on the top-ranked topic yields about 6.21 more responses than posting
on the tenth most salient topic (95 percent confidence interval [3.1, 9.4]).
The final
two columns of Table 2 shows that we reach a similar conclusion if we analyze the
log of the number of posts:
posting on national topics increases the total attention
to the post.

Effects
Focusing on national
and trending topics
also increases
the number
of
con-
stituents who respond to legislators’ posts, but decreases the share of the comments
that come from constituents.
Table 3 shows that after legislators post on national
topics they increase the number of constituents who respond, but decrease the share
of
responses that come from constituents.
The first four columns of
Table 3 re-
veal posting on national topics increases the number of responses from constituents,
though note that the increase in the number of posts from constituents is substan-
tially lower than the overall increase in posts.

While the counts of who is participating are important, elected officials are also
interested in the relative composition of who posts on a topic:
the share of posters
who constituents and non-constituents.
Offices often want to target their responses
at constituents for electoral reasons and this will be easier when constituents compose

The same relationship holds if we analyze the logarithm of the number of constituent posts.
20
a larger share of the respondents.
There is also a statistical
reason to analyze the
share of posts from constituents:
because some offices receive many comments, they
exert a great deal
of influence on the regression estimates.
Analyzing the share of
comments removes the share of the influence of these observations.
The two right-hand columns of
Table 3 show that posting on national
topics
decreases the share of posts that come from constituents.
The bivariate relationship
shows that,
on average,
posts on a national
topic have six-percentage points fewer
comments from constituents than local posts (95-percent confidence interval [-0.07,
-0.05]).
The lower-proportion of
responses from constituents remains even after
including legislator fixed effects.

Fixed Effects
Elected officials, then, are able to exert an influence on both the number of posts
that they receive in response to their messages and the composition of who replies
to their posts.
Elected officials are also able to shape the agenda with the content
of their posts.
Table 4 shows that when elected officials post on a particular topic,
they receive a greater share of comments about that topic.
We focus on how elected
officials affect the share of comments on a post about either national or local issues.
We do this, just as with our analysis of constituent comments, to limit the influence
of high-leverage observations and because elected officials are often interested in the
relative share of posts on a particular topic.
This reveals that legislators are able to
21
exert a substantial influence on the composition of the subject of messages received.
For example,
when legislators post on national
topics they increase the share of
comments about national topics 9-percentage points (95-percent confidence interval
[0.083,
0.097]).
In contrast,
posting on national
issues decreases the share of posts
from constituents about local
issues—defined as either about local
political
issues
or the representative directly—8 percentage points (95-percent confidence interval
[-0.077, -0.090]).
Accordingly, a government official posting about local issues raises
the share of constituents’ comments on local issues by around 8 percentage points.

Table 4 shows that legislators are able to exert an influence over the kinds of
comments they receive.
Of course, grouping issues into national and local issues is a
coarse partition of what legislators are discussing and potentially could overstate the
influence legislators exert over the subject of what the public discusses on politicians’
Pages.
To demonstrate that legislators exert a more fine-grained control over what
posts they receive from commenters, we examine the relationship between the topics
of legislators’
posts and the subsequent topics of posts from constituents.
For the
models presented here we assign each post from a legislator to the topic with the
maximum proportion.
Figure 3 shows the increase in the proportion of comments
about each topic, given that the legislator posted on that particular topic.
The solid
dot is the point-estimate while the intervals are 95-percent confidence intervals.
Figure 3 shows that across nearly all topics when legislators post on a topic they

increase the share of constituent comments on that topic.
The effect is largest for
discussions about the Iran nuclear agreement.
When a legislator posts on the Iran
nuclear agreement there is a 16-percentage point increase in the share of comments
about the Iran nuclear deal (95-percent confidence interval [0.158, 0.164]).
The lone
topic where legislators appear able to exert little influence is on vitriolic attacks,
primarily because elected officials rarely write a post that is substantially about
vitriolic attacks.
Table 5 shows the effect averaged across all
the topics,
revealing the consistent
and robust effect of legislators’ topics on the subsequent response from constituents.
When elected officials post on a topic they increase the number of responding posts
about the topic and the share of responding posts about the topic.
The increase is
robust and remains even after including elected official fixed effects.
Elected officials exert a clear and specific influence over the subject of

Table 6 shows that
elected officials also exert an influence over the tone of the messages they receive.
When elected officials post on national
issues they increase the share of comments
that attack the elected official, though we fail to reject the null of no effect when we
include fixed effects.
There is a marked decrease, however, in the share of comments
that praise elected officials when they post on national
topics,
with a post on a
national
topic decreasing the share of
comments that praise the elected official

Table 6 shows that elected officials are able to exert an influence over the sen-
timent expressed in response to their posts,
though there appears to be a limited
influence on the rate of attacks.
Of course, there are other measures of the disdain
elected officials might face online.
An angry public might express their distaste with
a large number of swear words.
Table 7 examines the rate that posts on the elected
24
official’s Page make use of swear words.

Table 7 shows that when elected officials engage in national topics, they encounter
more swear words overall
and at a higher rate per comment.
For example,
when
legislators post on a national topic, they observe 1.1 additional posts that contain a
swear word (95-percent confidence interval, [0.86, 1.34]).
A different way to measure
the incidence of
vitriol
is to ask the probability that at least one post contains a
swear word.
The fourth column shows that posting on a national
topic causes a
12 percentage point increase in the probability of
at least one swear word in the
subsequent posts—nearly doubling the baseline rate of
13 percentage points (95-
percent confidence interval [0.11, 0.13]).
The final column shows that posting on a
national topic causes a 1% increase in the rate of swear words across posts.
Elected officials, then, exert a noticeable influence over the subject and sentiment
of subsequent posts.
When elected officials wade into national debates they receive
more responses and more responses on that topic,
but they also risk greater scorn
from constituents and less praise.
In contrast, posting on local issues leads to fewer
responses,
but a larger share of
responses that come from constituents and that
praise the elected official.
Rather than mere passive recipients of constituents’ views,
elected officials are able to exert influence over the types of comments they receive.

Conclusion
We have shown that elected officials are able to cultivate a specific audience for public
messages.
To demonstrate this, we have analyzed over 2.7 million public posts and
comments made on representatives’
Pages on the social
media site Facebook.
Not
only do our findings illuminate why constituents contact elected officials about par-
ticular issues, it also reveals what constituents contact their elected officials about.
We demonstrate that constituents raise substantive national policy issues with their
representative, engage on local issues, and praise their elected officials at twice the
rate they attack.
Our findings show that elected officials are not just passive recipients of messages
from the public.
Rather, elected officials are able to interact with constituents, so-
liciting comments from constituents that are likely to bolster support for the elected
official.
This provides a very different view of why constituent communication mat-
ters for political
representation.
Communication is not just an opportunity for
representatives to learn what particularly passionate constituents think about issues
or,
more generally,
to take a biased sample of
opinion in their district.
It is also
an opportunity for representatives to interact with constituents who share the same
issue priorities as elected officials.
Constituent communication on controversial issues is more similar to the purpose
of constituency service than previous literature has supposed (Cain,
Ferejohn and
Fiorina, 1987).
Much like constituency service, representatives view it as an oppor-
tunity to bolster electoral
support.
And like constituency service,
representatives
are able to take actions that increase the likelihood the public will interact with the
office.
This electoral motivation suggests that communication between constituents
and elected officials is not just about constituents expressing views.
It is also about
representatives fortifying support.
Our findings raise several new and important questions about legislative behav-
26
ior, political communication, and representation.
Of obvious interest is understand-
ing how this effect varies across different media.
We have presented evidence that
elected officials attempt to set the agenda when they hold town hall
meetings in
their districts.
More comprehensive evidence is needed to understand when and
how elected officials are able to affect the content of messages they receive.
Further,
our findings raise new normative questions about the value of constituent commu-
nication for political representation.
Most troubling is that our results might imply
that constituent communication is more useful for elected officials to garner support
than for constituents who want to hold their elected officials accountable.
