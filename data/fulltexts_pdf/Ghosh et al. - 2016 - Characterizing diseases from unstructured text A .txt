ABSTRACT
Traditional disease surveillance can be augmented with a wide variety of real-time sources such as, news and social media.
However, these sources are in general unstructured and, construction of surveillance tools such as taxonomical correlations
and trace mapping involves considerable human supervision. In this paper, we motivate a disease vocabulary driven word2vec
model (Dis2Vec) to model diseases and constituent attributes as word embeddings from the HealthMap news corpus. We use
these word embeddings to automatically create disease taxonomies and evaluate our model against corresponding human
annotated taxonomies.
We compare our model accuracies against several state-of-the art word2vec methods.
Our results
demonstrate that Dis2Vec outperforms traditional distributed vector representations in its ability to faithfully capture taxonomical
attributes across different class of diseases such as endemic, emerging and rare.
1 Introduction
Traditional disease surveillance has often relied on a multitude of reporting networks such as outpatient networks, on-field
healthcare workers, and lab-based networks. Some of the most effective tools while analyzing or mapping diseases, especially
for new diseases or disease spreading to new regions, are reliant on building disease taxonomies which can aid in early detection
of outbreaks.
In recent years, the ready availability of social and news media has led to services such as HealthMap
7
which have been used
to track several disease outbreaks from news media ranging from the flu to Ebola. However, most of this data is unstructured
and often noisy. Annotating such corpora thus requires considerable human oversight. While significant information about
both endemic
4, 22
and rare
19
diseases can be extracted from such news corpora, traditional text analytics methods such as
lemmatization and tokenization are often shallow and do not retain sufficient contextual information. More involved methods
such as topic models are too computationally expensive for real-time worldwide surveillance and do not provide simple
semantic contexts that could be used to comprehend the data.
In recent years, several deep learning based methods, such as word2vec and doc2vec, have been found to be promising
in analyzing such text corpora. These methods once trained over a representative corpus can be readily used to analyze new
text and find semantic constructs (e.g. rabies:zoonotic = salmonella:foodborne) which can be useful for automated taxonomy
creation.
Classical word2vec methods are generally unsupervised requiring no domain information and as such has broad
applicability.
However, for highly specified domains (such as disease surveillance) with moderate sized corpus, classical
methods fail to find meaningful semantic relationships. For example, while determining the transmission method of salmonella
given that rabies is zoonotic (i.e. querying rabies:zoonotic = salmonella:??), traditional word2vec methods such as skip-gram
model trained on the HealthMap corpus fail to find a meaningful answer (saintpaul).
Motivated by this problem, in this paper we postulate a vocabulary driven word2vec algorithm that can find meaningful
disease constructs which can be used towards such disease knowledge extractions. For example, for the aforementioned task,
vocabulary-driven word2vec algorithm generates the word foodborne, which is more meaningful in the context of disease
knowledge extraction. Our main contributions are:
•
We formulate Dis2Vec, a vocabulary driven word2vec method which is used to generate disease specific word embeddings
from unstructured health-related news corpus. Dis2Vec allows domain knowledge in the form of pre-specified disease-related
vocabulary
V
to supervise the discovery process of word embeddings.
•
We use these disease specific word embeddings to generate automated disease taxonomies that are then evaluated against

four vertices represent the modeling accuracy for the disease characterization of interest viz. symptoms, transmission agents,
transmission methods, and exposures. The area under the curve for each disease class represent the corresponding overall
accuracy over all the characterizations. Best characterization performance can be seen for emerging diseases.
human curated ones for accuracies.

Finally, we evaluate the applicability of such word embeddings over different class of diseases - emerging, endemic and rare
for different taxonomical characterizations.
Preview of our results:
In Figure 1,
we provide a comparative performance evaluation of Dis2Vec across the disease
characterization tasks for endemic,
emerging and rare diseases.
It can be seen that Dis2Vec is best able to characterize
emerging diseases. Specifically, it is able to capture symptoms, transmission methods and transmission agents, with near-perfect
accuracies for emerging diseases. Such diseases (e.g. Ebola, H7N9) draw considerable media interest due to their unknown
characteristics. News articles reporting emerging outbreaks tend to focus on all characteristics of such diseases - symptoms,
exposures, transmission methods and transmission agents. However, for endemic and rare diseases, transmission agents and
exposures are better understood, and news reports tend to focus mainly on symptoms and transmission methods. Dis2Vec can
still be applied for these class of diseases but with decreased accuracy for these under-represented characteristics.
2 Related Work
The related works of interest for our problem are primarily from the field of neural-network based word embeddings and their
applications in a variety of NLP tasks.
In recent years, we have witnessed a tremendous surge of research concerned with
representing words from unstructured corpus to dense low-dimensional vectors drawing inspirations from neural-network
language modeling.
3, 5, 15
These representations, referred to as word embeddings, have been shown to perform with considerable
accuracy and ease across a variety of linguistic tasks.
1, 6, 20
Mikolov et al.
12, 13
proposed skip-gram model, currently a state-of-the-art word embedding method, which can be trained
2/15
using either hierarchical softmax (SGHS)
13
or the negative sampling technique (SGNS).
13
Skip-gram models have been found
to be highly efficient in finding word embedding templates from huge amounts of unstructured text data and uncover various
semantic and syntactic relationships. Mikolov et al.
13
also showed that the such word embeddings have the capability to capture
linguistic regularities and patterns. These patterns can be represented as linear translations in the vector space. For example,
vec(Madrid) - vec(Spain) + vec(France) is closer to vec(Paris) than any other word in their corpus.
9, 14
Levy et al.
10
analyzed the theoretical founding of skip-gram model and showed that the training method of SGNS can be
converted into a weighted matrix factorization and its objective induces a implicit factorization of a shifted PMI matrix - the
well-known word-context PMI matrix
2, 21
shifted by a constant offset.
In,
11
Levy et al.
performed an exhaustive evaluation
showing the impact of each parameter (window size, context distribution smoothing, sub-sampling of frequent words and
others) on the performance of SGNS and other recent word embedding methods, such as GLoVe.
16
They found that SGNS
consistently profits from larger negative samples (
>
1
) showing significant improvement on various NLP tasks with higher
values of negative samples.
Previous works on neural embeddings (including the skip-gram model) define the contexts of a word to be its linear context
(words preceding and following the target word). Levy et al.
8
generalized the skip-gram model and used syntactic contexts
derived from automatically generated dependency parse-trees. These syntactic contexts were found to capture more functional
similarities, while the bag-of-words nature of the contexts in the original skip-gram model generates broad topical similarities.

3.1 Problem Overview
Disease taxonomy generation is the process of tabulating characteristics of diseases w.r.t. several pre-specified categories such
as symptoms and transmission agents.
Table 1 gives an example of taxonomy for three diseases viz. an emerging disease
(H7N9), an endemic disease (avian influenza) and a rare disease (plague). Traditionally, such taxonomies are human curated -
either from prior expert knowledge or by combining a multitude of reporting sources. News reports covering disease outbreaks
can often contain disease specific information, albeit in an unstructured way.
Our aim is to generate automated taxonomy
of diseases similar to Table 1 using such unstructured information from news reports. Such automated methods can greatly
simplify the process of generating taxonomies, especially for emerging diseases, and lead to a timely dissemination of such
information towards public health services. In general, such disease related news corpus is of moderate size for deep-learning
methods and as explained in section 1, unsupervised methods often fail to extract meaningful information. Thus we incorporate
domain knowledge in the form of a flat-list of disease related terms such as disease names, possible symptoms and possible
transmission methods, hereafter referred to as the vocabulary
V
. Figure 2 shows the process of automated taxonomy generation
where we employ a supervised word2vec method referred to as Dis2Vec which takes the following inputs - (a) the pre-specified
disease vocabulary
V
and (b) unstructured news corpus
D
and generates embeddings for each word (including words in the
vocabulary
V
) in the corpus.
Once word embeddings are generated, we employ a cosine comparator to create a tabular list
of disease taxonomies similar to Table 1. In this cosine comparator, to classify each disease for a taxonomical category, we
calculate the cosine similarities between the embedding for the disease name and embeddings for all possible words related to
that category. Then, we sort these cosine similarities (in descending order) and extract the words (higher up in the order) closer
to the disease name hereafter referred to as top words found for that category. For example, to extract the transmission agents
for plague, we calculate the cosine similarities between the embedding for the word plague and the embeddings for all possible
terms related to transmission agents and extract the top words by sorting the terms w.r.t. these similarities. We can compare the
top words found for a category with the human annotated words to compute the accuracy of the taxonomy generated from
word embeddings. In the next 2 subsections, we will briefly discuss the basic word2vec model (skip-gram model with negative
sampling) followed by the detailed description of our vocabulary driven word2vec model Dis2Vec.
3.2 Basic Word2vec Model
In this section, we present a brief description of SGNS - the skip-gram model introduced in
12
trained using the negative sampling
procedure in.
13
The objective of the skip-gram model is to infer word embeddings that will be relevant for predicting the
surrounding words in a sentence or a document. The skip-gram model can also be trained using Hierarchical Softmax method
as shown in.
13
3.2.1 Setting and Notation
The inputs to the skip-gram model are a corpus of words
w
∈
W
and their corresponding contexts
c
∈
C
where
W
and
C
are the
word and context vocabularies. In SGNS, the contexts of word
w
i
are defined by the words surrounding it in an
L
-sized context
window

L
, . . . ,
w

. Therefore, the corpus can be transformed into a collection of observed context and word
pairs as
D
. The notation
#
(
w
,
c
)
represents the number of times the pair
(
w
,
c
)
occurs in
D
. Therefore,

∑
c

(

and

where
#

and

are the total number of times
w
and

occurred in
D
. Each word

and similarly, each context

is represented as a vector
c

R
T
, where
T
is the dimensionality of the
4/15
word or context embedding. The entries in the vectors are the latent parameters to be learned.
3.2.2 Objective of SGNS
SGNS tries to maximize the probability whether a single word-context pair
(
w
,
c
)
was generated from the observed corpus
D
.
Let
P
(
D
=
1
|
w
,
c
)
refers to the probability that
(
w
,
c
)
was generated from the corpus, and
P
(
D
=
0
|
w
,
c
) =
1
−
P
(
D
=
1
|
w
,
c
)
the probability that
(
w
,
c
)
was not. The objective function for a single
(
w
,
c
)
pair is modeled as:
P
(
D
=
1
|
w
,
c
) = σ (
w
·
c
) =
1
1
+
e
−
w
·
c
(1)
where w and c are the T -dimensional latent parameters or vectors to be learned.
The objective of the negative sampling is to maximize
P
(
D
=
1
|
w
,
c
)
for observed
(
w
,
c
)
pairs while minimizing
P
(
D
=
0
|
w
,
c
)
for randomly sampled ”negative” contexts (hence the name ”negative sampling”), under the assumption that randomly
selecting a context for a given word will tend to generate an unobserved
(
w
,
c
)
pair.
SGNS’s objective for a single
(
w
,
c
)
observation is then:
log
σ (
w
·
c
) +
k
·
E
c
N
∼
P
D
[
log

(2)
where
k
is the number of ”negative” samples and
c
N
is the sampled context,
drawn according to the smoothed unigram
distribution P
D
(
c
) =
#
(
c
)
α
∑
c
#
(
c
)
α
where
α =
0
.
75 is the smoothing parameter.
The objective of
SGNS
is trained in an online fashion using stochastic gradient updates over the observed pairs in the corpus
D
. The global objective then sums over the observed
(
w
,
c
)
pairs in the corpus:

∑
(

) +


(3)
Optimizing this objective will have a tendency to generate similar embeddings for observed word-context pairs, while scattering
unobserved pairs in the vector space. Intuitively, words that appear in similar contexts or tend to appear in the contexts of each
other should have similar embeddings.
3.3 Disease Specific Word2vec Model (Dis2Vec)
In this section, we introduce Dis2Vec, a disease specific word2vec model whose objective is to generate word embeddings
which will be useful for automatic disease taxonomy creation given an input unstructured corpus
D
. We used a pre-specified
disease-related vocabulary
V
(domain information) to guide the discovery process of word embeddings in Dis2Vec. The input
corpus
D
consists of a collection of
(
w
,
c
)
pairs.
Based on
V
, we can categorize the
(
w
,
c
)
pairs into three types as shown
below:
•
D
(
d
)
= {(
w
,
c
)
: w
∈
V
∧
c
∈
V
}
, i.e. both the word w and the context c are in
V
•
D
(¬
d
)
= {(
w
,
c
)
: w
/
∈
V
∧
c
/
∈
V
}
, i.e. neither the word w nor the context c are in
V
•
D
(
d
)(¬
d
)
= {(
w
,
c
)
: w
∈
V
⊕
c
∈
V
}
, i.e. either the word w is in
V
or the context c is in
V
but both cannot be in
V
Therefore, the input corpus
D
can be represented as
D
=
D
(
d
)
+
D
(¬
d
)
+
D
(
d
)(¬
d
)
.
Each of these categories of
(
w
,
c
)
pairs
needs special consideration while generating disease specific embeddings.
3.3.1 Vocabulary Driven Negative Sampling
The first category (
D
(
d
)
) of
(
w
,
c
)
pairs, where both
w
and
c
are in
V
(
w
∈
V
∧
c
∈
V
), is of prime importance in generating
disease specific word embeddings.
Our first step in generating such embeddings is to maximize
log
σ (
w
·
c
)
in order to
achieve similar embeddings for these disease word-context pairs. Apart from maximizing the dot products, following classical
approaches,
13
negative sampling is also required to generate robust embeddings. In Dis2Vec, we adopt a vocabulary (
V
) driven
negative sampling for these disease word-context pairs. In this vocabulary driven approach, instead of random sampling we
sample negative examples (
c
N
) from the set of non-disease contexts, i.e. contexts which are not in
V
(
c
/
∈
V
). This targeted
sampling of negative contexts will ensure dissimilar embeddings of disease words (w
∈
V
) and non-disease contexts (c
/
∈
V
),
thus scattering them in the vector space. However, sampling negative examples only from the set of non-disease contexts may
lead to overfitting and thus, we introduce a sampling parameter
π
s
which controls the probability of drawing a negative example
5/15
from non-disease contexts (
c
∈
V
) versus disease contexts (
c
∈
V
). Dis2Vec’s objective for
(
w
,
c
) ∈
D
(
d
)
is shown below in
equation 4.

where
x

U
(

, U(0,1) being the uniform distribution on the interval [0,1].
If
x
k
< π
s
, we sample a negative context
c
N
from the unigram distribution
P
D
c
/
∈
V
where
D
c
/
∈
V
is the collection of
(
w
,
c
)
pairs for which
c

V
and
P
D
c

V
=

∑
c

where

=

.
Therefore, optimizing the objective in equation 4 will have a tendency to generate disease specific word embeddings for values
of
π
s
≥
0
.
5
due to the reason that higher number of negative contexts (
c
N
) will be sampled from the set of non-disease contexts
(c
/
∈
V
) with
π
s
≥
0
.
5.
3.3.2 Out-of-vocabulary Objective Regularization
The second category (
D
(¬
d
)
) of
(
w
,
c
)
pairs consists of those pairs for which both
w
and
c
are not in
V
(
w
/
∈
V
∧
c
/
∈
V
).
These pairs are uninformative to us in generating disease specific word embeddings since both
w
and
c
are not a part of
V
.
However, minimizing their dot products will scatter these pairs in the embedding space and thus, a word
w
/
∈
V
can have similar
embeddings (or, get closer) to a word
w
∈
V
which should be avoidable in our scenario.
Therefore, we need to maximize
log
σ (
w
·
c
)
for these
(
w
,
c
)
pairs in order to achieve similar (or, closer) embeddings. We adopt the basic objective function of
SGNS for
(
w
,
c
) ∈
D
(¬
d
)
as shown below in equation 5.

3.3.3 Vocabulary Driven Objective Minimization
Lastly, the third category (
D
(
d
)(¬
d
)
) consists of
(
w
,
c
)
pairs where either
w
is in
V
or
c
is in
V
(
w
∈
V
⊕
c
∈
V
) but both cannot
be in
V
.
Consider an arbitrary
(
w
,
c
)
pair belonging to
D
(
d
)(¬
d
)
.
As per the objective (equation 3) of SGNS, two words are
similar to each other if they share the same contexts or if they tend to appear in the contexts of each other (and preferably both).
If
w
∈
V
and
c
/
∈
V
, then maximizing
log
σ (
w
·
c
)
will have the tendency to generate similar embeddings for the disease word
w
∈
V
and non-disease words
/
∈
V
which share the same non-disease context
c
/
∈
V
. On the other word, if
c
∈
V
and
w
/
∈
V
,
then maximizing
log
σ (
w
·
c
)
will drive the embedding of the non-disease word
w
/
∈
V
closer to the embeddings of disease
words
∈
V
sharing the same disease context
c
∈
V
. Therefore, we posit that the dot products for this category of
(
w
,
c
)
pairs
should be minimized, i.e. the objective
log
σ(−
w
·
c
)
should be optimized in order to ensure dissimilar embeddings for these
(
w
,
c
)
pairs. However, minimizing the dot products of all such word-context pairs may lead to over-penalization and thus we
introduce an objective selection parameter
π
o
which controls the probability of selecting
log
σ(−
w
·
c
)
versus
log
σ (
w
·
c
)
. The
objective for
(
w
,
c
) ∈
D
(
d
)(¬
d
)
is shown below in equation 6.


where
z
∼
U
(

)
,
U(0,1) being the uniform distribution over the interval [0,1].
If
z
< π
o
,
log
σ(−
w
·
c
)
gets optimized,
otherwise Dis2Vec optimizes
log
σ (
w
·
c
)
. Therefore, optimizing the objective in equation 6 will have a tendency to generate
disease specific embeddings with values of
π
o
≥
0
.
5
due to the reason that the objective
log
σ(−
w
·
c
)
will be selected for
optimization with a higher probability over log
σ (
w
·
c
)
.
Finally, the overall objective of Dis2Vec comprising all three categories of
(

)
pairs can be defined as below.

Similar to SGNS, the objective in equation 7 is trained in an online fashion using stochastic gradient updates over the three
categories of
(

3.4 Parameters in Dis2Vec
Dis2Vec inherits all the parameters of SGNS, such as dimensionality (
T
) of the word embeddings, window size (
L
), number of
negative samples (
k
) and context distribution smoothing (
α
). It also introduces two new parameters - the objective selection
parameter (
π
o
) and the sampling parameter (
π
s
). The explored values for each of the aforementioned parameters are shown in
Table 6.
4 Experimental Evaluation
We evaluated Dis2Vec against several state-of-the art methods.
In this section,
we first provide a brief description of our
experimental setup, including the disease news corpus, human annotated taxonomy and the domain information used as the
vocabulary
V
for the process. We present our experimental findings in Section 4.2 where we have compared our model against
several baselines and also explore its applicability to emerging diseases.
4.1 Experimental Setup
4.1.1 Corpus
We collected a dataset corresponding to a corpus of public health-related news articles in English extracted from HealthMap,
7
a
prominent online aggregator of news articles from all over the world for disease outbreak monitoring and real-time surveillance
of emerging public health threats. Each article contains the following information - textual content, disease tag, reported date
and location information in the form of (lat, long) coordinates. The articles were reported during the time period 2010 to 2014
and correspond to locations from all over the world. The textual content of each article was pre-processed by sentence splitting,
tokenization and lemmatization via BASIS Technologies’ Rosette Language Processing (RLP) tools.
17
After pre-processing,
the corpus consisting of 124850 articles was found to contain 1607921 sentences, spanning 52679298 words.
Words that
appeared less than 5 times in the corpus were ignored, resulting in a vocabulary of 91178 words.
4.1.2 Human Annotated Taxonomy
Literature reviews were conducted for each of the 39 infectious diseases of interest in order to make classifications for
transmission methods, transmission agents, clinical symptoms and exposures or risk factors.
Methods of transmission were first classified into 8 subcategories - direct contact, droplet, airborne, zoonotic, vectorborne,
waterborne, foodborne, and environmental.
For many diseases, multiple subcategories of transmission methods could be
assigned.
Transmission agents were classified into 8 subcategories - wild animal, fomite, fly, mosquito, bushmeat, flea, tick
and domestic animal.
The category of clinical symptoms was broken down into 8 subcategories: general, gastrointestinal,
respiratory, nervous system, cutaneous, circulatory, musculoskeletal, and urogenital. A full list of the symptoms within each
subcategory can be found in Table 2.
For disease exposures or risk factors, 7 subcategories were assigned based on those
listed/most commonly reported in the literature. The subcategories include: healthcare facility , healthcare worker, schoolchild,
mass gathering, travel, animal exposure, and weakened immune system. The animal exposure category was further broken down
into farmer, veterinarian, market and slaughter. For some diseases, there were no risk factors listed, and for other diseases,
multiple exposures were assigned.
4.1.3 Disease Vocabulary
V
Disease vocabulary
V
is provided as prior knowledge to Dis2Vec in order to generate disease specific word embeddings as
explained in section 3.3.
V
is represented by a flat list of disease-related terms consisting of disease names (influenza, h7n9,

slaughter, farmer, etc.). Total number of words in
V
is found to be 103. In Figure 3, we show the distribution of word counts
associated with different taxonomical categories in the disease vocabulary (

are terms related to clinical symptoms followed by exposures or risk factors (

4.1.4 Baselines
We compared the following baseline models with Dis2Vec on the four disease characterization tasks.
•
SGNS: Unsupervised skip-gram model with negative sampling
13
described in section 3.2.
•
SGHS: skip-gram model trained using the hierarchical softmax algorithm
13
instead of negative sampling.
•
CBOW
: Continuous bag-of-words model described in.
12
Unlike skip-gram models, the training objective of the CBOW model
is to correctly predict the target word given its contexts (surrounding words).
CBOW
is denoted as a bag-of-words model as the
order of words in the contexts does not have any impact on the model.
All models (both baselines and Dis2Vec) were trained on the HealthMap corpus using a
T
-dimensional word embedding via
gensim’s word2vec software.
18
We explored a large space of parameters for each model.
In Table 6, we provide the list of
parameters, the explored values for each parameter and the applicable models corresponding to each parameter. Apart from the
parameters listed in Table 6, we also applied the sub-sampling technique developed by Mikolov et al.
13
to each model in order
to counter the imbalance between common words (such as, is, of, the, a, etc.) and rare words.
In the context of NLP, these
common words are referred to as stop words. For more details on the sub-sampling techniques, please see Mikolov et al.
13
Our
initial experiments (not reported) demonstrated that both the baselines and Dis2Vec showed improved results on the disease
characterization tasks with sub-sampling versus without sub-sampling.
4.1.5 Accuracy Metric
We evaluate the automatic taxonomy generation methods such that for a taxonomical characteristic of a disease, models that
generate similar set of terms (top words) as the human annotated ones are more preferable. As such, we use cosine similarity
in a min-max setting between the aforementioned sets for a particular characterization category as our accuracy metric. The
overall accuracy of a model for a category can be found by averaging the accuracy values across all diseases of interest. This is
a bounded metric (between
0
and
1
) where higher values indicate better model performance. We can formalize the metric as
follows.
Let
D
be the disease and
C
be the taxonomical category under investigation.
Furthermore, let
C
1
,
C
2
, · · · ,
C
N
be all
possible terms or words related to
C
and
H
1
,
H
2
, · · · ,
H
M
be the human annotated words. Then the characterization accuracy
corresponding to category C and disease D is given below in equation 8.

and the word embeddings of the terms related to

. Therefore,

H
j
is among the top words found by the word2vec model for the category
C, then the ratio in the numerator is high leading to high accuracy and vice versa.
4.2 Results
In this section we try to ascertain the efficacy and the applicability of Dis2Vec by investigating some of the pertinent questions
related to the problem of disease characterization.
1.
Sample-vs-objective: which is the better method to incorporate disease vocabulary information into Dis2Vec?
2.
Does disease vocabulary information improve disease characterization?
3.
What are beneficial parameter configurations for characterizing diseases?
4.
Importance of taxonomical categories - how should we construct the disease vocabulary?
5.
Can Dis2Vec be applied to characterize emerging, endemic and rare diseases?
Sample-vs-objective: which is the better method to incorporate disease vocabulary information into Dis2Vec?
As
described in Section 3,
there are primarily two different ways by which disease vocabulary information (
V
) guides the
generation of embeddings for Dis2Vec (a) by modulating negative sampling parameter (
π
s
) for disease word-context pairs
(
(
w
,
c
) ∈
D
(
d
)
) referred to as Dis2Vec-sample and (b) by modulating the objective selection parameter (
π
o
) for non-disease
words or non-disease contexts (
(
w
,
c
) ∈
D
(
d
)(¬
d
)
) referred to as Dis2Vec-objective.
We investigate the importance of these
two strategies by comparing the accuracies for each strategy individually (Dis2Vec-sample and Dis2Vec-objective) as well as
combined together (Dis2Vec-combined) under the best parameter configuration for a particular task in Table 3. As can be seen,

no single strategy is best across all tasks. Henceforth, we select the best performing strategy for a particular task as our Dis2Vec
in the next Table 4.
Does disease vocabulary information improve disease characterization?
Dis2Vec was designed to incorporate disease
vocabulary information in order to guide the generation of disease specific word embeddings.
To evaluate the importance
of such vocabulary information in Dis2Vec, we compare the performance of Dis2Vec against the baseline word2vec models
described in section 4.1.4 under the best parameter configuration for a particular task. These baseline models do not permit
incorporation of any vocabulary information due to their unsupervised nature. Table 4 presents the accuracy of the models for
the 4 disease characterization tasks - symptoms, exposures, transmission methods and transmission agents. As can be seen,
Dis2Vec performs the best for 3 tasks and in average. It is also interesting to note that Dis2Vec achieves higher performance
gain over the baseline models for the symptoms category than the other categories. The superior performance of Dis2Vec in
the symptoms category can be attributed to two factors - (a) higher ercentage of symptom words in the disease vocabulary
V
(see Figure 3) and (b) higher occurrences of symptom words in the HealthMap news corpus.
News articles reporting a
disease outbreak generally tend to focus more on the symptoms related to the disease rather than the other categories. Given the
functionality of Dis2Vec, higher occurrences of symptom terms in outbreak news reports will lead to generation of efficient
word embeddings for characterizing disease symptoms.

What are beneficial parameter configurations for characterizing diseases?
To identify which parameter settings are
beneficial for characterizing diseases, we looked at the best parameter configuration of all the 6 models on each task.
We
then counted the number of times each parameter setting was chosen in these configurations (see Table 6).
We compared

for the disease characterization tasks.
For the smoothing parameter(

) for characterizing diseases. For the
number of negative samples

, all the applicable models seem to benefit from
k

except Dis2Vec-combined which seems to
prefer

. For the window size (
L
), all the models prefer smaller-sized context windows (either 5 or 10) except SGHS which
prefers larger-sized windows (
L

) for characterizing diseases. Finally, regarding the dimensionality (
T
) of the embeddings,
Dis2Vec-combined, Dis2Vec-sample and SGNS are in equal favor of both 300 and 600 dimensions.
Dis2Vec-objective and
SGHS prefer 300 dimensions and CBOW is in favor of 600 dimensions for characterizing diseases.
Importance of taxonomical categories - how should we construct the disease vocabulary?
We followup our previous
analysis by investigating the importance of words related to each taxonomical category in constructing the disease vocabulary
towards final characterization accuracy. To evaluate a particular category, we used a truncated disease vocabulary consisting of
disease names and the words in the corresponding category to drive the discovery of word embeddings in Dis2Vec under the best
parameter configuration for that category. We compared the accuracy of each of these conditions (Dis2Vec (exposures), Dis2Vec
(transmission methods), Dis2Vec (transmission agents), Dis2Vec (symptoms)) against Dis2Vec (full vocabulary) across the 4
characterization tasks. Table 5 presents our results for this analysis and provides multiple insights as follows. (a) Constructing
the vocabulary with words related to all the categories leads to better characterization across all the tasks.
(b) As expected,
Dis2Vec
(symptoms) is the second best performing model for the symptoms category but it’s performance is degraded for other
tasks. The same goes for Dis2Vec (transmission methods) and Dis2Vec (transmission agents). (c) Therefore, it indicates that
11/15
in order to achieve reasonable characterization accuracy for a category, we need to supply at least the words related to that
category along with the disease names in constructing the vocabulary.
Can Dis2Vec be applied to characterize emerging, endemic and rare diseases?
We classified the 39 diseases of interest
into 3 classes as follows.
For classifying each disease, we plotted the time series of the counts of HealthMap articles with
disease tag equal to the corresponding disease.
•
Endemic
: We considered a disease as endemic if the counts of articles were consistently high for all years with repeating
shapes. E.g.- rabies, avian influenza, west nile virus.
•
Emerging
: We considered a disease as emerging if the counts of articles were historically low, but have peaked in recent
years. E.g.- Ebola, H7N9, MERS.
•
Rare
: We considered a disease as rare if the counts were consistently low for all years with or without sudden spikes. E.g.-
plague, chagas, japanese encephalitis. We also considered a disease as rare if the counts of articles were high in 2010/2011, but
have since fallen down and depicted consistently low counts. E.g.- tuberculosis.
Following classification, we found 4 emerging diseases, 12 endemic diseases and 23 rare diseases.
The full list of the
diseases under each class and the time series plots of the HealthMap article counts for these diseases can be accessed at
Dis2Vec
−
supplementary
. In Table 7, we compared the accuracy of Dis2Vec against the baseline word2vec models for each
class of diseases across the 4 characterization tasks under the best parameter configuration for a particular
{
disease class,
task, model
}
combination. It can be seen that Dis2Vec is the best performing model for majority of the
{
disease class, task
}
combinations except
{
endemic, exposures
}
and
{
rare, transmission agents
}
.
It is interesting to note that for the symptoms
category, Dis2Vec performs better than the baseline models across all the disease classes. Irrespective of disease class, news
reports generally mention the symptoms of the disease while reporting an outbreak.
As the characteristics of the emerging
diseases are relatively unknown w.r.t. endemic and rare, news media reports also tend to focus on other categories (exposures,
transmission methods, transmission agents) apart from the symptoms to create awareness among the general public. Therefore,
Dis2Vec performs better than the baseline models across all the categories for the emerging diseases.
For endemic and rare
diseases, Dis2Vec outperforms the baseline models w.r.t. the symptoms category.
For other categories, Dis2Vec performs
better overall, although the performance gain is not high in comparison to the symptoms. News media reports tend to neglect
categories other than symptoms while reporting outbreaks of endemic and rare diseases. In Figure 4, we show the top words
found for each category of an emerging disease (H7N9), an endemic disease (avian influenza) and a rare disease (plague) across
all the models.
The human annotated words corresponding to each category of these diseases can be found in Table 1.
We
selected these 3 diseases due to their public health significance and the fact that these diseases have complete coverage across
all the taxonomical categories (see Table 1).
It is interesting to note that for H7N9, the top words found by Dis2Vec for the
symptoms category contain all the human annotated words fever, cough and pneumonia, while the top words found by SGNS
only contain the word fever. For exposures (H7N9), Dis2Vec is able to capture three human annotated words animal exposure,
farmer, slaughter.
However, SGNS is only able to capture the word animal.
For the symptoms category of the rare disease
plague, Dis2Vec is able to detect three human annotated words sore, fever and headache with SGNS only being able to detect
the word fever. Moreover, Dis2Vec is able to characterize the transmission method of plague as vectorborne with SGNS failing
to do so.
5 Conclusions
Classical word2vec methods such as SGNS and SGHS have been applied to solve a variety of linguistic tasks with considerable
accuracy. However, such methods fail to generate satisfactory embeddings for highly specific domains such as healthcare where
uncovering the relationships with respect to domain specific words is of greater importance than the non-domain ones. These
algorithms are by design unsupervised and do not permit the inclusion of domain information to find interesting embeddings.
In this paper, we have proposed Dis2Vec, a disease specific word2vec framework that given an unstructured news corpus and
domain knowledge in terms of important words, can find interesting disease characterizations. We demonstrated the strength of
our model by comparing it against three classical word2vec methods on four disease characterization tasks. Dis2Vec exhibits
the best overall accuracy for 3 tasks across all the diseases and in general, its relative performance improvement is found to
be empirically dependent on the amount of supplied domain knowledge.
Consequently, Dis2Vec works especially well for
characteristics with more domain knowledge (symptoms) and is found to be a promising tool to analyze different class of
diseases viz. emerging, endemic and rare. In future, we aim to analyze a greater variety of diseases and try to ascertain common
relationships between such diseases across different geographical regions.

Case study for emerging, endemic and rare diseases: Disease characterization accuracy plot for Dis2Vec (first
quadrant, red), SGNS (second quadrant, blue), SGHS (third quadrant, green), and CBOW (fourth quadrant, orange) w.r.t. H7N9
(left, emerging), avian influenza (middle, endemic) and plague (right, rare). The shaded area in a quadrant indicates the cosine
similarity (scaled between 0 and 1) of the top words found for the category of interest using corresponding model, as evaluated
against the human annotated words (see Table 1). The top words found for each model is shown in the corresponding quadrant
with radius equal to its average similarity with the human annotated words for the disease. Dis2Vec shows best overall
performance with noticeable improvements for symptoms w.r.t. all diseases.
