Abstract 
Patent thickets have been identified by various citations-based techniques, such as Graevenitz et 
al (2011) and Clarkson (2005). An alternative direct measurement is based on expert opinion. 
We use natural language processing techniques to measure pairwise semantic similarity of 
patents identified as thicket members by experts to create a semantic network. We compare the 
semantic similarity scores for patents in different expert-identified thickets: those within the 
same thicket, those in different thickets, and those not in thickets. We show that patents within 
the same thicket are significantly more semantically similar than other pairs of patents. We then 
present a statistical model to assess the probability of a newly added patent belonging to a thicket 
based on semantic networks as well as other measures from the existing thicket literature (the 
triples of Graevenitz and Clarkson’s density ratio). We conclude that combining information 
from semantic distance with other sources can be helpful to isolate the patents that are likely to 
be members of thickets.

Introduction 
Measurement of patent thickets is an important issue within the intellectual property field. 
Fragmentation of claims ownership dispersed in patent space has been used to measure the 
existence of patent thickets. Measurement has been based on qualitative methods such as 
interviews with executives on patenting strategies (Hall and Ziedonis (2001)) or on examination 
of citations to prior art and its fragmentation as measured by a Herfindahl concentration index 
(Ziedonis (2004), Galasso and Schankerman (2010)). Clarkson (2005) and Clarkson and De 
Korte (2006) suggest calculating measures based on network density of citations. Graevenitz et 
al (2011) suggests identification of critical references and calculating the density of “triples”, 
which are specific networks of these references. 
The citation based methods propose measures that return a proxy for overlap in a given 
patenting space. Graevenitz et al (2011) recognise the need to show external validity of these 
proxies, and do so by noting the match between occurrence of triples and the complexity of the 
technology, identified by Cohen et al (2000) in surveys of managers. 
An alternative means of external validation is to return to the qualitative methods that were 
present early in the literature, however, by surveying field experts. This can be used to create a 
thicket 
measure 
to 
compare 
to 
citations-based 
measures. 
Advances 
in 
natural 
language 
processing techniques facilitate this work, as they can be used to capture formally the networks 
created by expert classification of patents. This is the exercise we undertake here. We also 
combine the different thicket measures in a statistical model to predict thicket membership based 
on the pool of past patent characteristics. 
A difficulty of such an exercise is to give the experts sufficient guidance to detect what the 
researcher means by a “patent thicket”. Here, the literature gives mixed signals. Patent thickets 
have been referred to variously as “blocking patents”, “patent floods”, or “patent clusters” in 
(IPO, 2011). In a recent review of the literature, Egan and Teece (2015) enumerate the many 
3 
different definitions that have been used, each definition associated with one or more of seven 
distinct policy concerns. 
One common definition of a patent thicket, taken as a starting point in the Egan and Teece 
paper and corresponding to four of the seven policy concerns is “an overlapping set of patent 
rights requiring that a company must hack its way through in order to actually commercialize 
new technology” (Shapiro, 2001). A popular citations based measure of Graevenitz et al. (2011) 
is based on a slightly broader view that “the combination of complex technology and high 
volume patenting creates patent thickets, which can be defined as dense webs of overlapping 
patent rights.” The definition we provide to our experts is closely related to both. 
Indeed, 
patenting 
at 
high 
volumes 
appears 
to 
be 
occurring: 
according 
to 
the 
World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) there was respectively a 9.2%, 9% and 4.5% year-on-
year increase in the number of patent applications in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The total number of 
new patent applications in 2015 was 2.6 million (see WIPO, 2013, 2014, 2015). To the extent 
that these patents do not represent completely new areas of work, overlapping or even conflicting 
claims may rise with this increase in total applications (Barnett, 2014). If in addition there is a 
“lack of resources and misaligned incentives at patent offices dealing with a flood of patents” 
(Hall et al., 2013), then a contributing factor in generating thickets may be low quality drafting. 
Indeed, Hall and co-authors note that the critical references that form the basis of the Graevenitz 
et al (2011) exist precisely to allow patent examiners to redraw claims so that the underlying 
wording in the claims points to less patent overlap. An alternative approach departing from the 
same starting point is that, as the patent overlap derives from the wording in the claims, it 
should be traceable to those words via semantic analysis. 
The view that claim writing may be behind thickets has been noted by others, who question 
the quality of patent documents. Holman (2006) proposes that junk patents, which arise when 
patents are granted too broad claims, may contribute to thickets by creating patent interferences 
via extending their scope beyond the underlying innovation. The problem could be alleviated if 
4 
patent offices examined the patent claims more thoroughly but this requires more effort and 
scarce resources. Indeed, patent examiners spend very little time reviewing each application. 
According to Lemley (2001), overall time spent per application is about eighteen hours spread 
over the months of a patent granting process. He concludes that an automated method of 
comparing claims of a patent or an application against the pre-existing set of patents would 
increase significantly the efficiency of the patent thickets screening process. We will return to 
this point below
1
. Indeed, while some might be tempted to rely on litigation or the patent fee 
structure to weed out low quality patents, a recent paper by Schankerman and Schuett (2018) 
casts doubt on this view. This makes efficient screening more pressing. 
Semantic analysis of patents has already used in a few papers in the patent literature. A study 
by Preschitschek et al. (2013) studied semantic similarities in text of chosen USPTO patents and 
showed predictive power of semantic analysis for technology convergence. Yoon and Park 
(2004) was one of the first pieces of work where a network of keywords found in patents 
belonging to a technology field was used. Gerken and Moehrle (2012) used semantic analysis 
for detecting the novelty of innovations. Recently, Bergeaud et al. (2017) presented a method for 
classifying patent technologies with an automated model for analysing semantic contents of 
patent abstracts. Khun and Thompson (2017) analysed the word-count of the patents’ first claim 
in order to assess patent scope. Our study 
adds to these but focuses on patent thicket 
measurement. 
Document similarity can be measured in a wide variety of ways (Harispe, Ranwez, Janaqi, & 
Montmain, 2015). Many of the most common rely on document metadata to infer content and 
1
Consistent with the interpretation that thickets results from low quality patent review, Lemley and Shapiro 
(2005) note that “when patents are granted covering technologies that were already known or were obvious, the 
resulting patents could cause social costs without offsetting benefits”; however, they also propose a more strategic 
interpretation, noting that patent thickets result when, “companies fil[e] numerous patent applications on related 
components that are integrated into a single functional product”. This can create the opportunity for royalty 
requests or for outright blocking of technology development, as proposed by Heller and Eisenberg (1998).

perform similarity comparisons. In the context of patents this is often done by categorizing 
inventions according to their technical classification (e.g. USPC or IPC) and treating inventions 
of the same category as similar (see e.g., Fleming, 2001). However, these metadata-oriented 
approaches essentially gloss over intra-category variation between documents and as such 
provide only coarse measures of document similarity. 
To achieve more precise similarity measures, one must look to the contents of documents and 
compare them to one another. This can be done very simply by using a relatively straightforward 
“bag-of-words” approach (see e.g., Lang, 1995) that treats each document as the set of the words 
it uses, or alternately the somewhat more nuanced TF-IDF approach, which weights words based 
on both their importance to the document and their frequency within the entire corpus being 
analysed (Salton & McGill, 1986). These relatively simple text comparison methods are, 
however, hampered by their inability to detect latent similarities between documents that might 
contain content on a similar area, but use a somewhat different vocabulary to discuss it. 
More sophisticated natural language processing techniques address many of the weaknesses 
of these comparatively simple document comparison methods. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
2
is a well-established method to detect latent similarities between texts and compress them to a 
common set of dimensions that can then be compared to one another (Deerwester, Dumais, 
Landauer, Furnas, & Harshman, 1990; Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, 1998). LSA takes account of 
word co-occurrence to detect latent similarities in the way vocabularies are used (e.g. the fact 
that “car” and “automobile” appear in similar contexts) and as such, the resulting reduced-
dimensional vector representation of the documents can be used to more accurately identify 
similar or dissimilar documents. 
To the best of our knowledge ours is a first attempt to use the semantic distance between 
patent documents to identify patent thickets. We calculate pair-wise patent semantic distance, 
creating a semantic patent network, where links between patents are weighted by the semantic

distance. In order to form a more accurate picture, we use the full body text of patents including 
claims, 
rather 
than 
focusing 
solely 
on 
keywords 
or 
abstracts. 
We 
hypothesize 
that 
the 
overlapping rights indicative of patent thickets will result in semantic similarity between patents 
that occupy the same thicket. To test this hypothesis we benchmark semantic similarity measures 
against a set of expert identified patent thickets, which we implicitly take as accurate measures 
that we are attempting to replicate by our semantic analysis. 
Apart from an identification of a group of patents as a patent thicket, the relationship of 
patents within the group is important as well. A standard list of possible relationship types would 
include blocking, complementary, independent, or substitute patents (Clarkson, 2005). While the 
Hall and Ziedonis (2001) and Ziedonis (2004) methods focus on general blocking relationships, 
Clarkson (2005) looks instead at substitutes, which he argues can also generate hold-up. The 
method presented in this paper, based on semantic networks could potentially cover either 
substitutes or complements, although our treatment is linked more to the former. The method is 
also directly linked to the Shapiro (2001) definition of patent thickets via our instructions to our 
experts on thicket identification. Being a contents-based method we derive linkages directly from 
overlapping content of claims rather than via citations. Our work includes a measure of 
fragmentation, which is also used to proxy the portion of patent thickets reflecting hold-up rather 
than defensive patenting concerns in some work (Noel and Schankerman, 2006, Galasso and 
Schankerman, 
2010). 
We 
have 
a 
separate 
measure 
for 
the 
thicket 
itself, 
however, 
with 
fragmentation added alongside our semantic indicator. 
We find that, indeed, patents belonging to the same expert-identified thicket are closer 
semantically than other combinations of patents: in other words, semantic distance varies with 
the membership of any pair of patents in different thickets, or membership in a thicket while the 
other patent is not a member of a thicket, or whether neither belongs to a thicket. Patents within 
the same thicket tend to be semantically similar. Moreover, the average semantic distance 
between these combinations of thicket membership differ in a statistically significant way from 
one another. Finally, we find that the semantic distance between patents in discrete technological 
7 
areas is shorter than it is for complex technologies, which accords with the intuition that in 
complex technologies patent thickets may cover a wider range of patent claims. 
Our findings suggest the possibility of creating quantitative semi-automated methods for 
preliminary patent thicket screening in the same vein as the critical references discussed by Hall 
et al (2013), based on semantic distance to the extent that it captures the evaluation an expert 
would make. We propose such a statistical model, which provides a certain probability that a 
given patent belongs to a thicket and test it, showing that semantic distance can be informative of 
expert 
opinion, 
whereas 
triples 
and 
weighted 
average 
patent 
citation 
density 
are 
broadly 
indicative but not as closely tied. This may be due to the definition of patents used in the expert 
instructions: our point is that expert opinion can be represented by semantic analysis, and this 
can be used to represent the thicket definition that is selected. If the resulting thickets differ 
from the patents flagged by other methods, it may indicate that those methods correspond to a 
different definition. Whether that alternative definition is better or worse for the purposes of the 
analysis is an issue we do not address. As pointed out by Egan and Teece (2015), the 
appropriate definition will depend on the policy question that is posed. 
In the remaining part of the paper, section 2 introduces the methodology used, section 3 
presents the results, section 4 contains results on an overlap between patent thickets, triples 
(Graevenitz et al., 2011), and weighted average patent network density (Clarkson, 2005), section 
5 introduces an analytical model for thicket recognition based on semantic networks and section 
6 concludes.

Methodology 
We use data from the USPTO on 12,312 patents from 58 patent groups (subclasses within the 
USPC classification scheme), sampled as for the end of February 2015. The dataset contains the 
full text and bibliographic data of the patents, including data on the filing company, application 
and granting dates and the number of claims. 
8 
We selected a group of 8 subject matter experts and asked them to review patents in the 58 
patent groups under study. The experts were assigned to patent groups relevant to their fields of 
expertise. They were each asked to review patents within their field and identify those belonging 
to patent thickets. More precisely, these thicket identifiers
were experts in the fields of electrical 
systems, 
chemical 
engineering, 
material 
engineering, 
electricity: 
measuring 
and 
testing, 
electrolytic 
coating, 
nanostructures, 
dentistry, 
drugs, 
medical 
chemistry, 
surgery, 
image 
processing. 
To ensure they were working with similar definitions of what constitutes a patent thicket, we 
defined patent thickets for them using a modification of the Shapiro (2001) definition: “Patent 
thickets are dense webs of overlapping intellectual property rights owned by one or more 
different companies (patent owners), which create a potential high cost in commercializing a 
new technology, and this cost is difficult to assess upfront”. We incorporated the additional 
words 
based 
on 
feedback 
on 
confusions 
that could 
arise 
from 
using 
the 
shorter 
original 
definition. We do allow for the patents to be associated with a single firm, so that defensive as 
well as hold up reasons for thicket generation can potentially be taken into account. Hence, we 
allow for the full scope of issues that Egan and Teece flag as being evoked by this definition. 
Upon completing their review of the patents within each of their technical areas, the subject 
matter experts identified 307 patent thickets containing 2732 patents. In our sample the density 
of patent thickets (defined as the percentage of patents belonging to thickets from the full sample 
of patents) is 22%, on average each thicket contains 8.9 patents. 
With this expert-identified set of patent thickets in hand, we then set out to attempt to measure 
the semantic distance between patents identified as thicketed and non-thicketed patents. In order 
to determine the distance between patents, we first performed a latent semantic analysis (LSA) of 
the entire corpus
3
of granted utility patents issued from 1976 until late 2014. This LSA was 
3
First, extremely common and uncommon terms were removed from each documents term vector. Any term 
appearing fewer than 5 times across the entire corpus was dropped, as was any term appearing in over 50% of all 
documents. We then performed a TF-IDF transformation on the resulting term vectors, so that particularly important 
9 
performed by extracting the text from each patent’s abstract, description, and claims fields. 
These fields were combined, and then standard natural language processing transformations were 
made across all of the term vectors within the corpus. The resulting re-weighted term vectors 
were used to compute a 500-dimension LSA model. 
With 
the 
model 
computed, 
each 
document 
is 
then 
assigned 
a 
500-dimension 
vector 
representing its composition of topics within the entire patent semantic space. We then use these 
vectors to compute the pairwise cosine distance between patents of interest, the most commonly-
used measure for distance within vector space models (Turney & Pantel, 2010). Patents with a 
low score are proximate to one another within the patent topic space suggesting they contain text 
describing similar technical content, while patents with high distance scores have less in 
common with one another. 
We calculate scores for each patent pair within the 58 patent groups
4
and then compare the 
average distances for four different sets of the pairs using Welch's unequal variances t-test test 
for mean equality
5
(Welch, 1951). Pairs were divided in four sets
6
: I) Same thicket – where both 
patents belong to the same thicket; II) Different thickets - where both patents belong to a thicket 
but not the same one; III) Thicket/no thicket – where only one of the patents belongs to a thicket; 
IV) No thicket – where none of the patents belong to a thicket.

Results 
3.1.
Semantic distance between patents is the shortest in the same thicket 
Our primary finding is that the average distance between pairs of patents belonging to the 
same 
thicket 
is 
statistically 
different 
from 
other 
sets 
of 
pairs, 
and 
the 
result 
is 
strongly 
significant. This suggests that the semantic content of within-thicket patent pairs is more similar 
terms would be more heavily-weighted while less important terms would be more lightly-weighted.

There were overall more than 3.7 million patent pairs

It is a version of a Student-t test. It is more robust when samples have unequal variances and sizes.

"patent group", when we mention the USPTO patent classification.

than pairs of patents that do not inhabit the same thicket, and that this difference is detectable 
using natural language processing techniques. 
We demonstrate this in Figure 2, showing the details of the calculated average semantic 
distance and the size of the sample. The figure presents average semantic distance between pairs 
of patents in each of the sets (as defined in section 2), calculated as the average of the distances 
in each of the 58 patent groups, weighted by the number of patents. We have calculated the 
significance of differences using the linear OLS regression model with errors clustering. The 
base scenario is set I (same thickets). Dummies are used for the remaining sets. We have 
clustered errors by patents (the same patent can belong to more than one pair). All the 
coefficients are significant at a high level – more than 99.999%. We have also tested the 
regression with clustering of errors by patent groups (58 clusters) and the results hold with a 
similar significance level (the lowest being 99.997%). 
Figure 1 shows confidence intervals with significance level of 95%.

Note: The grey cells contain cases, where test was not passed with more than 95% significance or it was not possible to perform because there 
were not enough thickets in the group. Bold columns show results for the differences of mean semantic distance between “same thicket” and 
other sets.

While figure 2 strongly suggests that patents identified to be in the same thicket are 
semantically 
more 
similar, 
we 
additionally 
confirm 
that 
these 
differences 
are 
statistically 
significant by testing for the mean equality between sets of pairs of patents using the Welch test. 
We perform this test on six different combinations starting with mean equality test between set I 
and set II, (i.e. between pairs of patents belonging to the same thicket and pairs of patents 
belonging to different thickets), and then for each combination of sets I-IV. The same six tests 
were repeated for each of the 58 patent groups. 
Table 1 presents these results, showing the percentage of the groups for which the Welch test 
confirmed the statistical significance of the difference between means with various p-value 
thresholds. We use 95% significance level as a cut-off value for the test. In some cases, where 
there was only one or no thicket in a patent group, it was not possible to conduct the test. 
These tests confirm that the average semantic distance between patents in set I —when both 
patents are from the same thicket—is significantly lower than for other sets. Depending on the 
12 
setup, from the 58 patent groups, 82.8% (when testing for difference between averages in sets I 
and IV, i.e. patents belonging to the same thicket and patent outside any thicket) to 69% (I-II, i.e. 
patents from the same thicket compared with patents from different thicket) of groups have 
passed the test for difference in average semantic distance with 95% significance. What is more, 
the results are strong, as 63.8% to 55.2% of the results were significant with more than 
99.9999% significance. 
The differences in average semantic distances between other sets are also evident. However, 
the difference is least significant for the sets II – III, that is between different thickets and 
thicket/no thicket sets. There were 36.2% of groups with non-significant results of Welch test or 
where test was not possible. Also there were only 36.2% of groups significant at the level of 
99.9999% 
or 
more, 
compared 
to 
48.3% 
for 
differences 
between 
sets 
II-IV 
and 
III-IV. 
Nevertheless, tests show that for the majority of groups, all four sets are distinguishable. 
Figure 2 presents two charts showing differences in average semantic distances for different 
patent groups (blue dots) with 95% confidence intervals. The sets with the strongest and the 
weakest differences were selected for the graph
7
. The first chart shows the difference between 
“same thicket” and “no thicket” sets, the second “different thickets” and “thicket/no thicket”. As 
shown in the table above, the first case exhibits larger differences in average semantic distance 
than the second case. It also shows that there are also groups where the semantic distance in set I 
(“same thicket”) is not the shortest (in total there are six groups where this is a case), but the 
general tendency for set I to have the shortest semantic distance is clearly visible.

Finally, comparing semantic distances between different sets of patents involves multiple 
comparisons, because the average semantic distance for one set needs to be compared with the 
14 
results for three other sets. Therefore, to confirm the above results, we perform the tests using a 
Bonferroni correction, which is one of the methods to compensate for multiple comparisons. In 
this context, the Bonferroni correction requires that in order to reach 95% statistical significance 
of the difference, each of the three tests for the equality of mean semantic distances between 
pairs of sets must have the p-value lower than 0.05/3 = 0.01667, i.e. be significant at 98.333% 
level. 
When the Bonferroni correction is taken into account, the semantic distance in set I, “Same 
thicket”, remains significant at 95% level in 37 patent groups; set II “Different thickets” in 26 
groups; set III “Thicket/No thicket” in 21 groups and set IV “No thicket” in 26 groups. For each 
set the total number of groups for which all three tests could be performed was 51, so, expressed 
in percent: set I – difference is significant in 72,5% of groups; set II – 51%; set III – 41,2%; set 
IV – 51%. When interpreting the results with a Bonferroni correction it is important to remember 
that this correction creates a more conservative test, lowering the probability of returning false 
positives. 
The main finding from this analysis is that patents belonging to the same thicket as identified 
by our experts are semantically more similar to one another than patents that belong to two 
different thickets. Furthermore, when two patents belong to different thickets the distance 
between them is greater, but also much closer to that observed to the case when there is no 
thicket or just one of the patents belong to a thicket. Shapiro’s (2001) definition of patent 
thickets as “dense webs of overlapping intellectual property rights” might lead one to expect 
patents within the same patent thicket to share semantic similarity so it is perhaps unsurprising 
that overlapping IP rights corresponds with detectable semantic similarity. As the results show 
that semantic similarity is a good proxy for expert identification, however, it suggests that we 
can use semantic similarity to identify potential patent thickets, taking expert opinion as 
reflecting a valid definition of a thicket. We explore this further in section 4, but for the 
remainder of section 3 we further explore the characteristics of our semantic groupings.

The semantic distance effect is greater in discrete than in complex technology areas 
In addition to comparing the semantic distance between patents in and outside thickets, we 
can also explore how the distance measure relates to the complexity of the technology field in 
question. To do so we first divide technology areas in accordance with the discrete and complex 
technology definitions presented in Cohen et al. (2000) and used by Graevenitz et al. (2011). The 
main difference between a complex and a discrete technology lies in how many separate 
patentable elements are implicated in market ready products. Where there are few elements, the 
technology 
is 
assessed 
as 
discrete. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
products 
requiring 
many 
unique 
patentable elements are considered complex. The list of patent groups and their membership in 
complex or discrete technology type can be found in the appendix. 
We find that the average semantic distance we observe between patents in the same thicket 
(set I) is shorter when those patents are in discrete technology areas and longer in complex ones. 
Furthermore, the difference between set I and other sets is much greater in discrete cases than it 
is in complex ones. Figure 3 depicts these differences in bar graphs, with standard errors below 
and extremely small confidence intervals. Interestingly, patents that do not belong to thickets 
have a larger average semantic difference in discrete technologies than in complex technologies, 
perhaps reflecting the wider ranging nature of claims in complex technologies, as we mentioned 
above.

Table 2 shows the percentage of the groups where the differences between average semantic 
distances of sets are statistically significant and confirms that analysing discrete and complex 
technologies separately does not change the overall conclusions from the full sample presented 
in Table 1. The overall tendency, however, is that there is a higher percentage of groups with 
statistically significant differences at 95% for complex than for the discrete areas, with an 
exception of difference between set I and set II (i.e. same versus different thickets). This may be 
explained by the smaller average number of patents per group in discrete technologies.

The above results suggest that semantic distance as an indicator of potential patent thickets is 
likely to be more powerful when assessing discrete rather than complex technologies. Equally, 
knowing whether the underlying technology area tends to be complex or discrete can aid in 
calibrating the method: if the difference in semantic distance between those patents sharing 
membership in a thicket and those outside the thicket is smaller for complex technologies, it will 
be more difficult to distinguish between what is, and what is not in the thicket using semantic 
methodology. Given the fact that complex technology areas tend to have a greater number of 
patents within the technology class, and that these patents are more semantically similar, this 
would lead one to expect more detected thicketing in complex areas, all else equal. This supports 
the findings of Graevenitz et al. (2011), who detect more thickets in complex technologies than 
in 
discrete 
ones. 
Furthermore, 
the 
greater 
semantic 
distance 
within 
thickets 
in 
complex 
technology areas suggests that patents which belong to thickets in these areas are more diverse, 
i.e. these thickets are also more complex, covering a larger variety of rights. 
3.3.
The above results hold if we control for experts 
As we have used expert opinion as our base, we repeat our analysis controlling for the identity 
of each expert so as to see if there are any outliers in behaviour. The control for expert identity 
is both interesting in itself and a way for us to be sure that errors in individual judgement were 
not driving our overall results. We find that our results still hold: accordingly, Table 3 below 
breaks down the tests by expert. 
There is no difference in the main conclusions presented in previous subsections: for each 
expert the average semantic distance for patents in the same thicket is the shortest; the results for 
most of the groups are statistically significant; and for the majority of the groups the average 
semantic distance for patents in different thickets is also statistically significant, apart from 
expert C, who assessed only one group.

Comparison of an expert-based method of patent thicket recognition, triples and 
network density 
In this section we compare the sample of USPTO patents examined by experts against two 
thicket measures described in literature – triples introduced in Graevenitz et al. (2011) and 
weighted average patent network density presented in Clarkson (2005). 
The Graevenitz et al. (2011) “triples” patent thicket identification method has recently 
attracted significant attention. Triples are triads of firms’ portfolios of critical patents within a 
technology group, where there are bilateral citations between the portfolios of three different 
firms. This corresponds to the idea that, where there are overlapping portfolios of three firms, the 
negotiation process between them or with another entity is costly in terms of resources. The idea 
of triples, used as a proxy measure for patent thicket density, has been used recently to 
investigate competition (Graevenitz et al., 2013), new entries into technological areas (Hall et al., 
2015) and patent opposition (Harhoff et al., 2016). 
20 
We compare the results obtained with the triples method with the expert-based method of 
patent thicket identification by comparing the share of patents that experts identify as belonging 
to thickets with the share of patents that belong to triples within given technology groups. We 
reproduce the triples thicket identification method on patents granted by the EPO
8
and map 
these, where possible, with patents from our USPTO sample, using the PATSTAT database. 
Triples 
are 
calculated 
in 
the 
OST-INPI/FhG-ISI 
technology 
areas 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
the 
comparability with the original Graevenitz et al. (2011) paper and because the measure requires 
broad samples. Subsequently, we compare patents that belong to triples with patents that were 
identified as belonging to thickets by field experts. When interpreting the results one must 
remember that triples are calculated on much larger sample of patents than the sample our 
experts examined. Furthermore, the triples methodology places much more prominence on 
fragmentation of rights than the definition that we provided to the experts. 
The comparison shows that only 3.7% percent of patents in expert-identified thickets belong 
to the triples. This is barely higher than the baseline 3.2% thicket membership we observe when 
we look at all of the patents, from our USPTO sample that were mapped to EPO patents. This 
small increase in the percentage of patents that belong to triples, when moving from the whole 
sample 
to 
patents 
that 
our 
experts 
identified 
as 
within 
thickets, 
suggests 
that 
the 
triples 
methodology and the experts identified very distinct groups of patents. The left pane of Figure 3 
bolsters this point by examining individual technology areas and plotting the share of patents in 
expert-identified thickets against the share of patents belonging to triples identified using the 
Graevenitz et al. (2011) method. A simple regression run on the data shows little overlap 
between the two with R
2
=0.0485. 
The above results do not mean that the triples method is not good as a proxy for identifying 
density of thickets in a technology area at the aggregate level, but it does suggest that it may not 
closely agree with expert judgement on existence of thickets amongst specific patents and given 
the definition we provided to the experts. The two have identified quite different sets. At the 
8
Triples may be calculated only on the EPO database as they require cited patents to be assessed whether they 
constitute a critical innovation. 
21 
same time, the USPTO sample we used was small, so our findings should be expanded with 
other expert-based analyses, ideally using a larger sample of patent groups and drawing on the 
EPO dataset, which would not require mapping to USPTO data. 
Figure 3. Green dots indicate share of patents belonging to thickets vs share of patents 
belonging to triples in different technologies (left panel) or vs Clarkson’s (2005) adjusted 
densities in various patent groups (right panel). Discrete technology areas are coloured on

Note: Three outliers were removed from the chart on the left due to very small number of patents in our USPTO sample. Out of 58 USPTO patent 
groups two were removed from the chart on the right, because of no internal citations

Weighted average patent network density (Clarkson, 2005) is a measure calculated as a 
proportion of directed (in or out) citations in patent networks to all possible (in or out) citations, 
with the network defined on a patent group. Clarkson (2005) suggests that where the density is 
higher than the surrounding set of patents a patent thicket can be identified. The measure is based 
on an idea that patents in a potential patent thicket should cite one another more densely than 
patents not belonging to the thicket. This set-up results in higher density values for substitutes, 
than for complementary patents even though both types could potentially result in the sort of 
hold-up that has been associated with thicket “problems”. For example, the author presents 
calculations for two patent pools MPEG-3 (a video compression technology) and PRK (a 
medical technology) and obtains results 0.029 and 0.203 respectively. The MPEG-3 technology 
22 
is a pool of complementary patents essential to a standard, while PRK contains rather substitute 
patents, describing similar approach to the same technology
9
. 
In order to compare Clarkson’s density with our expert-based method we have calculated 
Clarkson’s measure
10
on the groups from USPTO classifications. The right pane on Figure 3 
plots the network density measure against the share of patents in expert-identified thickets. 
Similarly to the triples the simple regression shows little overlap between the two measures, with 
R
2
=0.0367. In order to account for different number of patents within groups we have estimated 
an OLS regression with dummy variables for small groups and an outlier with density of 13%. 
None of the coefficients was significant, nor was the F-test of the regression model. The 
robustness 
of 
the 
above 
findings 
was 
checked 
by 
calculating 
the 
Clarkson’s 
measure 
on 
respective patent classes and on the OST-INPI/FhG-ISI technology areas. In none of the cases 
can the share of patents belonging to the expert-identified thickets be related to the Clarkson 
density in a statistically significant manner. 
Our findings suggest that the expert judgement, derived from a standard thicket definition and 
well correlated with the semantic similarity of the whole body of the patent texts, is not well 
correlated with two citation based measures at the individual patent level. This suggests that 
semantic similarity may be a useful tool in identifying patent thickets, albeit not necessarily 
those identified by citation measures. This may simply make Egan and Teece’s point more 
formally: there may be a number of concepts corresponding to thickets and, as not all reflect the 
same concerns, not all have the same features.

A semantic network model for thickets recognition 
A way to incorporate the divergence of these methods as well as their value is to propose a 
logit model based on the network of pairwise semantic distances and drawing from information 
9
Régibeau et al. (2012) indicate that Clarkson density is a noisy measure, its value depending strongly on how 
broadly the patent network, i.e. technology, is defined. 
10
We use the weighted average patent network density described by formula (6) in Clarkson (2005). 
23 
contained in other methods, specifically triples and Clarkson’s weighted average patent network 
density. The model is aimed at explaining the newly added patent’s probability of membership in 
an existing thicket within a given patent group. The result returned by the model could, for 
example, serve as a prompt indicating whether a patent or patent application overlaps existing 
patents heavily. 
The model has been estimated on an “in-sample” dataset and tested on “out-of-sample” data. 
The quality of the model has been assessed on the out-of-sample portion of the data, for which 
we have forecasted the theoretical probability of being in a thicket given specific characteristics 
of a patent application in question. Year 2001 was chosen a break point between in-sample and 
out-of-sample portions of the data
11
. More precisely, the estimation sample consists of patent 
applications from years 1976-2000 (5,482 patents of which 1,088 are in thickets), while the 
testing sample contains patents from the period 2001-2010 (3.089 patents of which 467 belong to 
thickets). 
The 
logit 
regression 
model 
was 
estimated 
using 
the 
generalized 
linear 
model 
and 
its 
implementation in R. The results of the estimation are presented in Table 4, where the dependent 
variable is the membership of a patent in a thicket
12
. The independent variables of interest were: 
minimal semantic distance – distance to the most similar earlier patent; Clarkson’s ratio for a 
group (at the moment of filing); the triples ratio for a group, in other words, the share of patents 
belonging to triples (at the moment of filing) where triples are identified using Graevenitz et al’s 
(2011) method translated to our dataset. We also include controls for the number of backward 
citations; number of claims; number of patent groups to which a patent under consideration 
belongs to (a measure of interdisciplinary character of a patent); thicket ratio for a group – share 
of the patents belonging to thickets in a group of application (at the moment of filing); ; complex 
group dummy variable – group from complex or discrete technology area; HHI calculated for 
11
The rule for selecting the break year was that it must be a first year which for which there was at least 60% of 
patents in sample and 70% of patents in the thickets in the estimation dataset. 
12
In both estimation and test samples the earliest patents in thickets were not counted as “in a thicket”, because 
the model takes into account time-varying structure of patents groups, so the first patent does not belong to any 
thicket at the moment of its filing. 
24 
patents for a given group (at the moment of filling, based on filing dates of eventually successful

14
; total number of 
applications and of patents granted in a given group at the moment of, respectively, filing or 
granting a given patent; dummies for class (or group) of patent and the application year. 
Compared to model (1), the first four models listed in Table 4, models (2)-(5), differ from the 
first model by one variable (or one group of dummies) only. Respectively, these additions are: 
dummies for class of patents (2), thicket ratio (3), Clarkson’s ratio (4) or triples ratio (5). Model 
(6) is a model with dummies for patent groups instead of various group-specific variables. 
Model (7) consists of patent-specific variables only. Model (8) is the same as model (1) but 
without semantic distance. Model (9) is the same as (1) but with no year dummies. Model (10) 
is a simplified version of (9) without information on number of prior applications and grants in a 
given patent group.

First, the models suggest that applications belonging to groups that, at a given moment in 
time, tend to include patents belonging to thickets, are substantially more likely to be in a thicket 
as well. This suggests both that thickets are, to some extent, a characteristic of a patent group 
and that a larger pool of thicket patents breeds a higher likelihood that further work will impinge 
on those existing thickets. 
Second, the closer (semantically) is the patent application to an earlier most similar patent, the 
greater the probability that it will belong to a thicket. This is similar to our earlier discussion: 
semantic distance predicts the evaluation of our experts well. 
Third, patents belonging to many technology groups are part of a thicket with a higher 
probability. Complexity is unlikely to underlie this, as the relation holds when we control for 
complexity
15
. A similar relationship can be found for the number of backward citations. The 
positive correlation with backwards citations suggests that crowding in a group is associated with 
thicket emergence. 
Fourth, the number of claims in a patent application is not particularly relevant to the 
probability of the patent belonging to a thicket once one allows for various group characteristics, 
even if one does not control for semantic distance. Indeed, without group descriptors, the claims 
variable picks up the group effects that are captured by other group descriptors in the other 
equations. 
Fifth, Clarkson’s density ratio, and the triples ratio do not carry significance in most cases. 
Furthermore, the negative coefficient on triples indicates that the presence of existing triples in 
the group actually are negatively correlated with further thicket membership. As a high triples 
ratio indicates a relatively well defined set of patent holders, this may reduce the complexity of 
15
One could speculate why this would occur, but more thorough investigation would be required to support any 
specific interpretation. The result is intriguing, however, in the light of Noel and Schankerman’s (2006) model of 
enforcement costs related to the points of conflict in a patent. While this may be related to fragmentation, as in 
their work, it could also possibly be related to large applicability, which could be indicated by membership in a 
large number of groups.
27 
the patent examiner’s as well as the assignee’s task and so translate into higher quality patents 
overall. 
Sixth, concentration of patent ownership (measured by HHI) lowers the probability of 
occurrence of a new thicket (or to increase of size of the preexisting one) when the historic 
propensity of a group to include thickets is controlled for. Hence fragmentation at the group 
patent level is positively related to the prediction that a patent will fall in a thicket, as suggested 
by previous studies, mentioned above. Furthermore, the magnitude of the coefficient suggests a 
relatively strong effect. 
Seventh, there is a greater chance that a thicket will be created (or joined by a further patent) 
when the assignee has filed for a greater number of patents in the past. This suggests the 
possibility of defensive or strategic patenting driving some of the results, but is not definitive: 
the result could also suggest that patents resulting from a single research trajectory, as might be 
pursued by a single researcher, are more likely to interfere with each other because the 
underlying subject matter will tend to overlap. Hence, for a given quality of review more patents 
that overlap would tend to occur in such a trajectory. 
Finally, the opposite signs of the total number of prior filings and prior positive decisions in a 
given group suggest, taken together, that: a) patents that were granted after longer deliberation 
(sufficiently for the number of patents granted to be greater than the patents filed for before the 
examined patent), had a lower probability of belonging to a thicket, while the ones that were 
granted relatively quickly had a greater probability of being in a thicket. This last result is 
particularly intriguing, as it could be interpreted as suggesting that there may be a link between 
the quality of patent review and the likelihood of thicket membership. It is not definitive, 
however, as this quick review could also be associated with the familiarity of the patent 
examiner with the technology. Hence, learning effects could also be driving this result without 
any link to lower quality.

To facilitate interpretation, the odds ratio for thicket membership has been estimated for 
model (9), and is presented in Table 5. For continuous variables the incremental step of one 
standard deviation has been chosen to evaluate the change in odds due to a change in a given 
variable, for example we can see from the table below that an increase in semantic distance by 
one standard deviation would lead to a fall in odds of a patent belonging to a thicket by 42%.

To assess the performance of the model we consider two ratios: (1) a "false positive" ratio - 
which shows how many patents would be unnecessarily identified, i.e. how many patents flagged 
by the model as thickets are actually not in a thicket; (2) a “false negative” ratio – which shows 
how many patents in thickets would be wrongly omitted, i.e. how many patents flagged by 
29 
the model as not in a thicket, actually belong to a thicket. The “false positive” ratio can be 
regarded as an indicator of type I error, whereas the “false negative” ratio of type II error. The 
magnitude of the ratio will depend on a theoretical probability threshold of the assessment “not 
in a thicket” or “in a thicket” as an outcome of the model. We call this probability a critical value 
and present ratios for a range of critical values in Figure 6, below. Another way to see the 
exercise depicted in this figure is that we ask: for a given tolerance level, which model produces 
the fewest false positives and negatives? For example, if one were to apply this model to 
checking whether a patent should be reviewed for quality (ie, for perhaps contributing to a 
thicket) Figure 6 suggests that when the critical value is 0.1, around 15% of patents that are 
indeed members of thickets are wrongly classified as those that are not and 40% of patents that 
indeed do not belong to a thicket would be classified as belonging to one (which means that 60% 
of these could be subject to a quick-check only). Setting a critical value at 0.2 would change the 
values to be over 35% and around 20% respectively. The chart for the baseline model is 
presented in Figure 4, while the remaining charts can be found in the appendix. 
In this part, model (9) has been chosen as a baseline model due to the fact that year dummies 
are not useful for forecasting. For the sake of comparison, results for models (2)-(8) without 
yearly dummies and model (10) are presented in table 6 and in appendix D as well.

Table 6 summarises the performance of all the models. The table lists the share of the patents 
wrongly omitted from thickets that actually belong to a thicket (type II error) corresponding to 
the illustrated share of patents that don’t belong to a thicket but are wrongly identified as doing 
so (type I error). Clearly, lack of inclusion of data on the patent groups significantly worsens the 
predictive power (7’ vs 9) in the sense that the type I error increases strongly for a given type II 
error. Omission of the thicket ratio worsens results substantially (3’ and 8’ vs 9), while omission 
of historic group thicket information worsens performance less (or, one could argue, enhances it; 
9 vs 10). Similarly, impact of omission of the class dummies is substantial but inconsistent (2’ vs 
9). Omission of the Clarkson ration and Triplets reduces performance inconsistently (4’ and 5’ vs 
9). What is also interesting using (time-static) group dummies usually does not work better than 
using (dynamic) group-specific variables (6’ vs 9). 
6.
Conclusions 
If we assume that the legal definition of thickets as “an overlapping set of patent rights” is 
necessarily reflected in the body of the patent’s text, then semantic distance should be able to 
identify this feature. Accordingly, we calculate a semantic distance for pairs of patents based on 
the content similarity between the patent document text, creating thus a semantic network. We 
then use these distance scores to determine whether patents identified by a group of experts as 
belonging to thickets using a standard definition are semantically more similar to one another 
than other patents by comparing the mean semantic distance for patents in and outside thickets. 
Our key conclusion is that patents belonging to the same thicket as identified by our experts are 
closer semantically than other pairs of patents. This result is clearly dependent upon the 
definition provided to the experts and is a costly method of detection; however, semantic 
distance appears to be a good way of proxying the view that would be obtained by a careful 
reading of the patent document. Given the availability of computing power and natural language 
33 
processing tools, the performance of the proxy compared to expert view creates an interesting 
possible alternative to expert opinion. 
Our semantic measure also allows us to check on whether existing citation-based methods of 
identification also perform well to proxy expert view, as represented by semantic distance. 
Accordingly, 
we 
compare 
this 
content 
based 
method 
to 
two 
citations-based 
methods 
for 
identifying patent thicket membership as proxies for expert opinion, finding that the semantic 
method correlates more closely than the citations methods with the expert views. This does not 
indicate that either method is “wrong”: they may measure different things. The expert views are 
based on interpretation of a standard thicket definition and so may measure effects that are not 
the focus of the citation-based methods. In particular the definition would tend to include 
patents obtained for defensive reasons much more than the citation based methods. 
We then combine the various measures into a single model of thicket identification, and 
evaluate its performance in terms of its identification of false positives (membership of a thicket 
where this is not actually the case) and false negatives (lack of membership, when membership 
in the thicket actually is the case). We identify a model that performs relatively well and that 
also combines several measures of thickets, including citation based measures and controls for 
fragmentation, all of which have figured prominently in the thicket literature and all of which 
find some support within the model. Crowding and technology group complexity also play a 
role in the likelihood that a patent will belong to a thicket and enter into the specification. 
We view our work as contributing to patent thicket measurement on several levels. First, 
external validity of citations based measures has not been investigated thoroughly, although it 
has been mentioned as an issue. We have taken such a further step in this investigation. 
We have also illustrated the value of semantic analysis in capturing expert views on this topic. 
Shorter semantic distance does appear to identify thickets well in the sense of capturing this 
view. We also find that the semantic distance between patents belonging to thickets in discrete 
34 
technology areas is shorter than for those in complex areas, which confirms the intuition that 
patents in complex technologies cover a more diverse set of rights. It also suggests that it is 
easier for thickets to arise in complex technology areas, where there are more patents and those 
patents are more semantically similar, confirming the findings of Graevenitz et al. (2011). These 
findings hold when controlling for the experts used to identify patent thickets and are thus not 
influenced by a single expert whose expertise was misjudged. 
We find also that there is no significant overlap between individual patents indicated by 
experts as belonging to a thicket and patents belonging to triples (methodology from Graevenitz 
et al., 2011). Similarly, patent network density measure introduced by Clarkson (2005), shows 
no significant relation to the share of individual patents in these thickets. At the same time, we 
show that these alternative measures can be combined to create a quantitative model that 
identifies patent thickets. Such a model can provide a support for those interested in identifying 
patent thickets, including at early stages where the text of the patent is still being drafted as 
discussed with an emphasis on measurement by Hall et al., 2013 and examined by Gallini (2017) 
in the light of the theory of innovation incentives in the presence of cumulative innovation. We 
examine a logit model, which assesses the probability that a newly added patent would form a 
thicket. The model shows that the semantic distance combined with other information can be 
helpful in assessing a newly filed application. Important conclusions also include the fact that an 
important indicator of a patent belonging to a thicket is the previous density of thickets within a 
patent group. Fragmentation also is an indicator of thicket formation, which has been emphasised 
by the literature. 
Our method exploits expert opinion to identify thickets. This is not as precise as methods that 
have use data sets based on court cases. We have, then, sacrificed some ex post information 
confirming thicket membership in exchange for dataset size in some sense. While we investigate 
individual expert error as a source of our results and find that it is not, we should emphasise that 
what we aim for is not a tool enabling infallible recognition of patent thickets, but a method for 
delineating a set of patents which with high probability are members of a thicket. Indeed, it 
35 
would be interesting to repeat the approach used above with a broader group of experts and 
technology areas. It would also be interesting to perform similar analyses on EPO data or data 
from other patent offices.

Appendix – Latent Semantic Analysis 
We use latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester, Dumais, Landauer, Furnas, & Harshman, 
1990; Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, 1998) to measure the semantic distance between the patents in 
our dataset. One of the primary advantages of the LSA technique is that it enables the detection 
of “latent” similarities. That is, it does not require documents to use precisely the same 
terminology to detect similarities between them. Provided they co-occur with a similar terms, 
different words related to the same topic will both lead a document to have a higher weight on 
the 
same 
topic. 
For 
instance, 
if 
one 
patent 
uses 
the 
term 
“car” 
while 
another 
opts 
for 
“automobile” LSA can detect that these are related terms, and thus treat them similarly. 
We use the entire corpus of patents published by the USPTO between 1976 and 2015 to 
calculate our LSA model. These documents were downloaded from the public data dumps made 
available by the USPTO. We then take the full text of each granted patent - comprising the 
abstract, the description, and the claims - and use that as the terms representing each document. 
LSA takes as its starting point a document-term matrix, that is then transformed using SVD. We 
begin the creation of our matrix by generating a term-document matrix with a row for each 
granted patent (our input documents), a column for each unique term (i.e. word) used across the 
corpus. 
The 
matrix 
values 
are 
frequency 
of 
that 
term 
within 
each 
row’s 
relevant 
patent 
document. Because very common and very rare words provide little in the way of insight we 
remove all the words from a common set of stop words (Rijsbergen, 1979), as well as terms from 
the corpus that occur in more than 50% of all documents or fewer than 5 of the documents. This 
remove both very common words like ‘the’ or ‘claim’ or ‘and’ as well as highly unusual terms 
that are often typos or spelling errors. 
Once these low-information terms have been removed from the matrix, we then subject the 
corpus 
to 
a 
term 
frequency–inverse 
document 
frequency 
(tf-idf) 
transformation 
to 
further 
improve the semantic signal (Salton & McGill, 1986). We use a standard tf-idf transformation 
which multiplies the term’s frequency in the given document by the logarithmically-scaled 
inverse document frequency—that is the number of documents in the corpus divided by the 
number of documents the term appears in. A high tf-idf score for a particular term demonstrates 
that it occurs frequently within the given document, but rarely across the corpus, suggesting that 
41 
it provides a strong signal as to the document’s topical focus. Essentially, this re-weights terms 
based on the degree of insight they provide into a document’s topics. The resulting document/tf-
idf matrix is used as the input matrix for our LSA model. 
Once the input matrix has been assembled, we use the Gensim Python library to perform the 
dimensional reduction (
Ř
eh
ůř
ek & Sojka, 2010). Gensim takes the input matrix and performs a 
rank-reduced singular value decomposition on it, creating in the process a term-concept matrix, a 
singular values matrix, and a k dimensional document-concept matrix. The document-concept 
matrix is the output of primary interest when attempting to determine the similarity of documents 
within 
the 
corpus. 
The 
literature 
on 
determining 
the 
appropriate 
value 
of 
k 
generally 
recommends a value between 300–500 (Bradford, 2008) for larger sets of documents. Because 
our corpus of documents is quite large—approximately 5.5 million granted patents—and because 
patents cover a wide-variety of technical areas, we opt for 500 dimensions. The result is a 500 
dimension vector for each patent, representing its semantic content as “weights” within each of 
the 500 topics generated by the LSA process. 
Once the term-document matrix has been computed, we can use vector-space distance 
measures to measure how distant documents are from one another in the reduced-dimensional 
space. We use the commonly-used cosine distance (Landauer, Laham, & Foltz, 1998) to 
calculate pairwise distance for the patents in our study. Patents with a high cosine distance have 
concept vectors with dissimilar weightings, demonstrating that they cover unrelated technical 
topics. On the other hand, patents that have low cosine distance have similar concept vector 
weightings, suggesting that they are more similar. 
If we imagine that technical knowledge exists as a multidimensional space with some types of 
knowledge being “closer” together while others are more distantly-related, the entire process can 
be conceptualized using a spatial metaphor. For instance, the knowledge required to build an axe 
is quite similar to the knowledge required to build a hammer, and they are thus closer to one 
another in technical space. On the other hand, the knowledge required to build an axe is very 
dissimilar from the knowledge required to develop a complex tax minimization strategy and they 
are thus distant from one another in technical space. The LSA process essentially locates each of 
the patents in our corpus within a 500-dimensional technical space, while the cosine distance 
42 
calculation measures how closely (or distantly) related the information within each patent 
document is.
