Abstract
Automatically detecting shifts of meaning over time is desirable for Natural Language Processing
tasks as well as research in the Digital Humanities.
We train diachronic word embeddings on Dutch
newspaper data and compare representations of the same terms from different times to each other.
The aim is verifying whether such comparison can highlight the emergence of a new (figurative)
meaning for a given term.
The most interesting outcome of
this experiment is methodological:
while in some cases we observe that this method is efficient, as it has been shown to be in previous
work on Italian,
we also observe that in many other cases results are not what we would expect.
This leads us to an in-depth analysis of interfering aspects and to a discussion of methodological
choices, towards the development of what we believe is a timely and needed roadmap for developing
diachronic studies on meaning shifts that rely on distributed representations.
1.
Introduction
The meanings of
words are known to change over time,
and the rise of
new figurative uses is a
fundamental driver of this change (Haser 2003).
Detecting meaning shifts is beneficial to any NLP
task which relies on lexical
meaning resources,
as well
as for research in lexical
semantics.
More
concretely,
the aim of
this line of
research is to be able to automatically detect shifts in word
meaning in a completely unsupervised fashion from raw text, often relying on distributional semantic
representations.
The idea behind exploiting such representations is that the semantic space in which a given
word is located might change over time, if the meaning of the word itself changes at least partially,
such as with the emergence of
a new meaning.
For example,
one could expect that the location
in semantic space of
the word ‘mouse’
changed drastically after the computer tool’s invention by
Douglas Engelbart in the 1960’s,
thereafter called ‘mouse’.
Conversely,
the semantic space of
a
concept has been shown to stay pretty much the same across time,
becoming a reliable indicator
of
that very same concept,
even when the word used to express it changed in time.
An example
of this are the words ‘Walkman’ and ‘iPod’ expressing the ‘portable music player’-concept (Jatowt
and Duh 2014, Kenter et al. 2015).
Indeed, experiments in detecting diachronic semantic shifts have
been done in both directions:
detecting whether a word might gain new (figurative) meanings over
time, and detecting whether a meaning might become expressed by new words over time.
Building on the assumptions that (i) the semantic space of a word can be captured via distributed
semantic representations in the form of
word embeddings,
(ii) the embeddings of
the same word
can become substantially dissimilar across time if
a new meaning emerges,
and (iii) this can be
particularly true in the case of metaphoric shifts as the conceptual fields of occurrence differ a lot,
Del Tredici et al. (2016) propose a method for comparing and interpreting the spaces of five Italian
words that are known,
based on dictionary information,
to have undergone a metaphoric shift.
In their experiments,
they observe that a drop in similarity of
the embeddings of
the same word
over time often coincides with the introduction of a new figurative meaning in a reference Italian
dictionary.
c
2017 Hessel Haagsma and Malvina Nissim.
In order to further test the hypothesis of a correlation between a change in embeddings and the
introduction of a new meaning, we replicate Del Tredici et al.’s experiment on Dutch data.
By doing
so, we obtain a picture of meaning shift for a selection of Dutch words that is substantially fuzzier
than was observed for Italian data.
More specifically,
we stumble across several
methodological
aspects that we believe deserve proper attention,
before we can glean sensible interpretations of
the data.
We believe that what we observe can lead to improvements in the field of the automatic
detection of diachronic meaning shifts, and we establish a set of directions towards this end in our
discussion.
Contributions
Therefore, the aim of this paper is twofold:
(i) presenting results of a study where
the semantic space of
some pre-selected Dutch words is compared across time,
so as to spot a
potential dissimilarity of a word to itself that can be explained in terms of meaning shift (especially
figurative); and, most importantly, (ii) critically assessing all of the factors that contribute to what
we observe and how results can be interpreted, with particular attention to frequency, polysemy, and
other confounding factors.
Following such observations,
we offer an overview of what we think are
lessons learnt from this work, which can be turned into recommendations for more robust, reliable,
and scalable practices in setting up and evaluating meaning shift detection experiments based on
distributional semantic representations.

Approach
2.1 Data
We collect a corpus of Dutch newspaper articles by scraping the web pages of Trouw and Volkskrant.
The corpus covers the time period 1994–2016,
which is all
that is available in the online archives
of both newspapers.
All
articles were tokenized using Elephant (Evang et al.
2013),
resulting in a
corpus of 800 million tokens, of which 485 million are from Volkskrant texts, and 315 million tokens
are from Trouw texts.
No lemmatization is performed.
The corpus is organized in year-slices per
newspaper,
e.g.
all
text from Trouw in 1996 forms one subcorpus,
text from Volkskrant
in 2005
another,
and so on.
The sizes of
the different subcorpora diverge significantly,
ranging from 4.3
million (Volkskrant-1994) to 35.6 million (Volkskrant-2013).
2.2 Training Embeddings
We aim to track semantic change by measuring self-similarity for a given word, across time.
To do
this,
we need a set of diachronic embeddings,
i.e.
one set of embeddings per year-slice.
We train
these diachronic embeddings by broadly following the method presented in Del Tredici et al. (2016).
1
In this method,
diachronic embeddings are not made by training separate embeddings sets on
different year-slices and aligning them.
Rather, first embeddings are trained on the most recent year
(2016, in our case); then the obtained embeddings are used as the initialization for the embeddings
of the year prior, and then trained on the data of that year slice.
This is repeated until the data of
the least recent year (1994, in our case) has been incorporated.
This removes the need for alignment,
since all embeddings, regardless of year, exist in the same vector space.
This, in turn, allows for direct
comparison of embeddings year-to-year, which is our goal.
The reason for training in a ‘backwards’
fashion, rather than from the oldest year-slice to the newest one is the same as in Del Tredici et al.
(2016):
we expect the words with novel
meanings to occur with sufficient frequency in the most
recent year-slice, but not necessarily in the oldest year-slice.
As for the practical implementation, we use the gensim Python library (
ˇ
Reh˚uˇrek and Sojka 2010)
to train our embeddings using the word2vec skip-gram method (Mikolov et al.
2013).
We use the
two newspaper corpora separately, that is, we train separate sets of diachronic embeddings for each
newspaper.
We initialize the vocabulary on the set of all words from all years of a given newspaper

For the skip-gram modelling, hierarchical
softmax is used,
a learning rate of 0.01,
an embedding dimensionality of 200,
a window size of 5,
and 20 iterations of training over each year-slice.
2.3 Selection of Words
We use a pre-selected list of
words to investigate for new metaphorical
meanings.
This list was
composed from two sources:
suggestions of possible candidates by the authors,
and from the Van
Dale dictionary, the editors of which, upon request, kindly provided us with a full list of words which
gained a new, figurative meaning in the dictionary at some point between 2000 and 2016.
The full
list contains 321 words, most of which are highly infrequent and have very marginal new meanings.
Over 95% of these words were provided by Van Dale.
Since our corpus-based method only works for words which occur frequently enough,
we select
a subset of these 321 words for investigation,
using the following criterion:
the word has to have a
minimum average frequency of 10 words per million across all year-slices in both newspapers.
This
results in a final selection of 23 words.
2
The list comprises nouns,
verbs, and adjectives, as among
our choice criteria of word selection we did not set any constraint for part-of-speech.
This has the
advantage of
exploring meaning shift beyond just nouns,
as it’s usually done.
Note though that
because our corpora are not pos-tagged, we cannot control for part-of-speech in the matched data,
so that the word laag, ‘layer, low, stratum’, for example, which was included in the Van Dale’s list
in its noun form, will be found and considered in all of its occurrences, adjectives included.
3.
Analysis of Results
In this section we review the results we obtain by first showing what can be observed in the data,
and then by discussing several
cases,
including both positive and negative examples.
In addition,
we offer explanations for the dishomogeneous nature of the results, illustrating them with examples.
In Figure 1, and other figures, four values are plotted across the time span under considerations.
The solid lines represent the similarity of
a given word to itself
(here,
terreur,
‘terror’) in the
Volkskrant corpus (light blue line) and the Trouw corpus (dark red line).

average self-similarity across time for the 5000 most frequent words in Dutch as obtained from the
Lassy Small corpus (van Noord et al. 2013).
According to our hypothesis, and as partly shown in (Del Tredici et al. 2016), the introduction
of
a new (metaphorical) usage of
a word should cause a change of
contexts for that word,
which
should show up as a drop in self-similarity in the plot at a certain point in time.
In Figure 1, such
a drop can clearly be observed around the years 2007–2014 for both newspapers.
The drop is observed simply by manual inspection of the plots.
What is shown in Figure 1 is an
optimal case with a very clear pattern, which is not what we observe for most other sampled words.
In Figures 2 to 6 we present a representative sample of unclear and non-ideal cases, which will serve
to highlight a set of confounding factors and representation issues that we discuss in depth in what
follows,
as we believe they influence the observations we derive and their analysis.
These factors
have both to do with intrinsic properties of language and this phenomenon in particular (such as
frequency variation and polysemy),
as well
as with artefacts that are introduced by our modelling
choices (such as the corpus we use and the representation method we adopt).
3.1 Influence of frequency
Frequency affects the settings and results of our experiments in at least two ways.
First, absolute frequency in the whole dataset affects the stability of the representation, mainly
in that flow frequency will make the representations extremely unreliable and therefore little infor-
mative.
An example of
this is the word leermeester
3
,
‘master,
guru,
teacher’,
which is plotted in
Figure 2.
As we can see,
self-similarity is always below average,
and shows large,
random fluctua-
tions, which we take to be indicators of an unstable representation – due to there not being enough
instances of leermeester in the corpus for its representation to stabilise.
Second,
heavy fluctuations in frequency across the time span cause instability in the represen-
tation of
a word,
so that drops in self-similarity can potentially be explained as a by-product of
frequency peaks,
rather than as an indication of meaning shift.
This is illustrated well
by the ex-
ample of architectuur
4
,
‘architecture’,
in Figure 3.
In Figure 4 we show the frequency distribution
across the time slices for the same word.
It is rather straightforward to observe that the drop in self-
similarity in the Trouw around 2010-2012 has a direct correspondence in a frequency peak in 2011.
One might argue that the emergence of a new meaning can also prompt an increase in frequency, as
there are more contexts in which to use the word,
but it is unclear how such behaviour should be
accounted for in modelling diachronic shift using currently existing methods.
(see also Section 3.3
on sense change and topic change).
3.2 Influence of polysemy
The use of distributional semantic models for the detection of meaning shifts relies on the assumption
that the emergence of a new sense will mean that it will be used in a different context, which deviates
from the ‘default’
contexts the word was previously used in.
However,
this assumption becomes a
lot more unreliable when we are dealing with highly polysemous words.
In that case, self-similarity
across years will be based on a representation that covers a multitude of senses, so that the emergence
of a new one will only shift the representation very slightly, perhaps too little to be detected.
In their work,
Del
Tredici
et al.
(2016) clearly specify that in the choice of
words to analyse
they took into account polysemy, and their terms are either monosemous or minimally polysemous.
We do not control
for this in our word selection.
On the contrary,
we select our words based on
a frequency threshold,
which exacerbates the polysemy issue,
as more frequent words tend to also
be more polysemous (Zipf
1949).
Double influences of
high polysemy and high frequency makes
3.
The new sense consists of a metaphoric shift from leermeester referring to people only,
to being able to refer to
events and experiences as well.
4.
The new sense consists of
an extension of
meaning from only concerning physical
structures to concerning all
kinds of physical and abstract frameworks.

Illustrates the discrepancy between the

the analysis conducted under our method quite unreliable,
as these two factors tend to blur any
significant meaning changes observable through self-similarity.
This shows clearly in Figure 5, where
we show the behaviour of the word laag
5
, ‘layer, low, stratum’.
Here, we see a high, above-average
self-similarity, which is very stable across time and corpora.
Clearly, if the new sense of laag is used
in the corpus, it does not influence the representation enough to clearly show up in the plot.
3.3 Sense Change and Topic Change
Without manual inspection, it is hard to know whether a change in self-similarity (i.e.
a change in
the word’s contexts) is caused by a new sense or a shift in sense,
or by the use of the word in the
same sense,
but mainly on a different topic.
A related problem is that it is sometimes hard to say
whether a shift to a main use regarding a new topic constitutes a new sense or not.
This exacerbated by the fact that our corpus consists of newswire text, which is very much driven
by real-world events and popular topics.
As such, it could be that the word bodem shows a significant
drop in self-similarity, not because it acquires a new sense, but because it is was mainly used when
5.
The novel sense is roughly equivalent to betekenislaag, ‘layer of meaning’, as used when talking about a work of
art.
70
talking about finance at one point (de bodem van de schatkist
- ‘the bottom of the treasury’),
and
about earthquake trouble later (de Groninger bodem - ‘the soil of Groningen’).
3.4 Differences between Corpora
We make use of
two very similar,
but distinct corpora:
Trouw and Volkskrant.
Because they are
so similar — they are of
the same genre,
time period,
and country,
are both considered ‘quality
newspapers’,
and likely deal
with the same topics — we expect to see the same semantic changes
in both corpora.
Potentially,
the current study would allow us to investigate this hypothesis,
that
similar corpora show similar semantic changes,
or,
alternatively,
find points where they differ,
and
analyse those differences in more detail.
In practice, however, things are less ideal, and more complex.
Looking at the self-similarity over
time for nazi
‘nazi’
in Figure 6,
for example,
we see a nice,
clear dip in self-similarity,
around the
time where we would expect it to be.
Unfortunately,
that is only the case for the Trouw corpus.
In the Volkskrant
corpus we see no clear trends or effects, at all.
This leaves us with three possible
explanations:
1.
Ideally, the plot represents the true situation, and there is no change in Volkskrant.
There is a
true difference between the two newspapers, e.g.
due to different audiences or style conventions,
and manual analysis should be able to confirm this.
2.
Less ideally,
it turns out that the same semantic shift did occur in Volkskrant
as well,
but
because of the limitations of our method, we do not see it.
3.
Worst case,
the dip we see in the Trouw plot is an artefact,
and there is no shift in either of
the corpora.
We cannot tell which of these possible explanations is true, unless we manually analyse the corpora,
which is exactly what we try to circumvent by using an automatic method for detection of meaning
shifts.
If this was just the case for nazi, this would not cause a major problem, but we see the same
for other words,
such as management,
monument,
and dodelijk.
6
This poses a serious problem for
the drawing of strong conclusions from the analyses for these words.
3.5 Compounding in Dutch
A distinctive feature of
Dutch,
when compared to English,
is the prevalence of
noun-noun com-
pounds.
Of course, noun-noun compounds exist in English as well, but Dutch orthography dictates
that they are always written as a single word, whereas they tend to be written separately in English.
This is a small
difference,
but it has a potentially large influence on our method.
All
embeddings
are created on the token-level, and our tokenization procedure does not involve compound splitting.
Therefore, when applied to English, the embedding for nazi
would be influenced by the occurrence
of
‘grammar nazi’
in the corpus,
whereas for Dutch,
the embedding for ‘nazi’
does not take into
account an equivalent occurrence of taalnazi.
Although noun-noun compounds are frequent,
we might choose to simply ignore them,
given
that we have a large enough amount of data (similar to how we do not take into account inflectional
variation).
However, we know that compounding is one of the most important mechanisms for the
creation of neologisms, and thus, for novel sense creation (Booij and van Santen 1998, p. 147).
This
seems to be especially true for the novelty- and topic-driven writing one encounters in news media.
This is reflected in our newswire corpora, where it is easy to find compounding examples for words
from our word list,
as illustrated by Examples (1) to (3).
If our goal
is to detect novel
senses,
we
lose a significant amount of information by not dealing with compounds.

(Trouw, 2010)
Although compound splitting is not a trivial
task,
we could implement it as an additional
prepro-
cessing step, and keep the rest of the method as is.
Still, this would raise a rather crucial issue which
has to do with the fact that instead of one vector we would have two (one for taal
and one for nazi ).
While a promising solution has been proposed for dealing with adjective-noun composition (Baroni
and Zamparelli
2010),
it would still
remain to be explored whether a similar approach would fit
our cases at hand, especially considering the focus on novel sense emergence.
In this sense, splitting
compounds would give rise to an even more fundamental issue regarding what the novel sense should
be attached to:
in taalnazi,
is there a novel
sense of
nazi
that we should detect,
or is this just a
new word expressing a new meaning and should it be treated as such? Moreover, compound words
are words in their own right,
and can undergo meaning shifts similar to simplex words.
If we split
compounds in preprocessing, we lose the ability to investigate the semantic evolution of compound
words.
4.
Lessons learnt
Based on Section 3.1,
we summarise our observations in terms of points to be taken into account
when designing an experiment focused on detecting meaning shifts using distributed representations.
While we do not provide definite answers or methods on how to tackle some of the intrinsic problems
this kind of experiments involves, we aim at highlighting them so as to incorporate them in the design
phase of a new study.
Thus,
the question guiding this summary is the following:
assuming that novel
sense detection
is useful
and interesting,
from a natural
language processing,
but also from a digital
humanities
and social perspective, what are the requirements on on the performance of the method for it to be
useful, reliable, and scalable?
In order for automatic detection of
meaning shifts across time to scale up we need to move
towards a bottom-up rather than a top-down evaluation approach.
In doing so,
the experiments
we have described point to several aspects that need to be taken into consideration.
While it is far
from trivial to disentangle phenomena and factors, as they are all correlated and interact with each
other, we want to offer a summary here.
First, frequency is a crucial factor, both in the overall level of occurrence, as well as in terms of
fluctuation across years, as it can make representations unreliable.
Second,
polysemy has to be accounted for,
and decisions must be made on how it is detected
and quantified (external
resources or directly from the data).
What senses are there? Which ones
are used/implied? How to account for that in diachronic experiments?
Third, because we observe variation across different datasets (which are not even that different
in our case), drawing claims should be probably limited to the very specific context they come from
72
or should be further tested on a range of
different datasets in order to be able to generalise to a
wider level.
Fourth, a change in context or usage does not necessarily correspond to a change in meaning.
This
is especially true for highly polysemous words.
This observation concerns the underlying hypothesis
on which the whole work is built, but we believe it is a factor to be taken into account rather than
an obstacle.
Lastly, language-specific issues must be considered.
For example, in Dutch and other Germanic
languages compounding is a powerful tool to encapsulate new meanings of the words in a compound,
but this escapes an analysis that is purely token-based.
Other interesting examples would come from
morphologically rich languages, where only certain variations might undergo a meaning shift (e.g.
a
female word form vs.
a male word form), while others do not.

Previous Work
The main lines along which we want to compare our contribution to existing work are related to
the issues we have discussed in the previous section.
Specifically,
we discuss similar and different
representation methods, corpus size, the problem of context vs.
sense discrepancy, and the influence
of frequency and polysemy.
Since we attempt to reproduce only a single method,
namely that of
Del Tredici et al. (2016), these issues might be partially specific to the current method, and some of
them have already been noted or addressed in previous work.
By taking this into account,
we can
get a clearer view of which challenges remain for this task.
The method used to represent word meaning in this work and in Del Tredici et al. (2016), training
word embeddings diachronically by initializing the embeddings for year n on those trained on year
n-1 or n+1,
is based on the work by Kim et al. (2014).
This is a good way of getting embeddings
trained on different subcorpora (here, year-slices) to exist in the same embedding space.
Moreover,
it is intuitively elegant, since the meaning shift in real time is recreated by an embedding shift during
training time.
However,
other ways of
integrating embeddings from different time-period defined subcorpora
exist.
Hamilton et al.
(2016),
for example,
train embeddings separately for each time-slice,
and
use Procrustes alignment to enable cross-time similarity calculations.
A second alternative is to
circumvent the necessity of
having embeddings in the same vector space altogether,
as is done
by Kenter et al.
(2015).
They use a set of seed words to track the vocabulary used to describe a
certain concept through time, and do this across independent vector spaces by looking at the nearest
neighbours of the seed words.
This method could easily be applied to the detection of meaning shifts,
e.g.
by looking at the nearest neighbours of the word of interest.
Another notable difference between this work and previous work is the choice of corpus, corpus
size, and corpus language.
We use two Dutch newspaper corpora, of 315M and 485M words, spanning
a timeframe of approximately 20 years.
This is, of course, a limited view of the Dutch language, and
might contribute to some of the issues we face.
These issues, in turn, might be resolved by using a
bigger corpus, spanning a larger period of time, and containing more variation.
There is previous work on Dutch using a corpus of various newspapers spanning a longer period
(1950–1990), and containing approximately 2B words (Kenter et al. 2015), whereas Hamilton et al.
(2016) experiment with 3 different corpora for English,
containing different genres,
and spanning
a 200-year time period,
consisting of 410M to 850B words.
When comparing the different English
corpora,
Hamilton et al.
note that the biggest corpus also shows the clearest,
least variable,
and
most accurate results.
In addition, they provide a multilingual view, experimenting on large corpora
of German, French, and Chinese.
Still, most work considers only English text, and often newswire,
and more work on comparing meaning shift detection methods across languages and genres has to
be done.
Most, if not all, work on detecting meaning shifts make use of some sort of distributional meaning
representations,
and this carries with it the assumption that the context in which a word is used
73
defines the meaning of
the word.
The fact that this assumption constitutes a potential
source of
error is rarely discussed explicitly.
Gulordava and Baroni (2011) provide two clear examples of false
positives thrown up by their system, cases where the context of usage changed quite drastically, but
the sense of the word itself was judged to not have changed significantly.
For example, they find that
their system detects a shift in the discourse around sleep from mainly positive to mainly negative,
focused on sleep problems.
Gulordava and Baroni
suggest that this might be a useful
preliminary indication of
meaning
change, but in the meantime, distinguishing sense and context change remains a problem for meaning
shift detection.
This is corroborated by Hamilton et al. (2016), who note that a significant number of
the false positives of their system fall in the same category of discourse change without sense change.
For example, they suggest that a context change for the word male is caused by an increased use of
the word in the discourse around gender equality, rather than by the word acquiring a new sense.
Besides the issue of sense vs.
context change,
we are also not the first to notice the problems
of frequency and polysemy.
For example,
Kim et al. (2014) note that their method only works for
words which have a high enough frequency over the whole time period, and suggest using a measure
that incorporates both similarity and frequency.
More insights on how frequency and meaning
shifts interact are provided by Gulordava and Baroni (2011), who find that words with a decreasing
frequency over time are less likely to change,
whereas words which acquire a new meaning (e.g.
technology-related words like disk,
address),
are more likely to see an increase in frequency of use.
Hamilton et al.
(2016),
in turn,
explicitly set out to quantify the relation between frequency and
rate of semantic change (and polysemy), finding that high-frequency words are less likely to change,
and that polysemous words are more likely to see semantic change (controlling for frequency).
Gulordava and Baroni
look at change in frequency over time,
while Hamilton et al.
look at
average frequency over time, but neither looks at the combination of both:
that is, how to deal with
the interplay between overall frequency, frequency variation (including more complex variations than
simple increases or decreases over time), and detection of semantic shifts.
6.
Future Work
In addition to pointing out the difficulties that work on automatic detection of meaning shifts has to
face, we aim to contribute to the future development of the field by highlighting a series of possible
improvements and goals.
The first of these concerns evaluation.
Here, as in other works (Frermann and Lapata 2016, Del
Tredici et al. 2016), we use a form of top-down evaluation, where a set of words with known meaning
shifts is selected,
and it is assessed whether the detection method can highlight these shifts in
a particular corpus.
The main problem with this approach is that while they are attested in a
dictionary, it is unknown a priori whether these shifts actually occur in the corpus (and if so, with
what frequency), so that we cannot assess whether our method really detects all the expected shifts,
or whether they were never there in the first place.
Additionally, while a top-down approach might
serve well those who want to investigate some specific terms, for example in the digital humanities
field,
it cannot scale up towards a larger and more comprehensive study of meaning shift,
even for
a given language within a given time frame.
A better alternative is a bottom-up evaluation approach, where shifts are detected automatically
from the data via some developed measure,
and only the detected shifts are then evaluated (e.g.
Hamilton et al.
(2016)).
Thus,
we go from asking ‘Can we spot
the expected meaning shifts in
the data? ’
to ‘Are the meaning shifts spotted in the data actual
meaning shifts? ’.
A downside of
this bottom-up evaluation is that it needs to be done manually,
by relatively expert annotators,
or resource-based,
e.g.
using dictionaries from different time periods.
As such,
in order to do this
evaluation in a consistent way that is reproducible and comparable to related work, a clear definition
of what is and what is not a meaning shift is required.
A large corpus annotated for this phenomenon
is obviously costly to create (Kenter et al. 2015), and can never be truly exhaustive.
74
Having to make do with manual
inspection of
potential
shifts,
a useful
tool,
and an overall
improvement,
would be a system that can provide examples of
pre- and post-shift instances of
a
word for manual
inspection,
both during development and evaluation.
Ideally,
these would be the
examples that are most typical
of
the unshifted and shifted meaning,
to prevent the necessity of
inspecting large numbers of examples.
This would aid researchers in developing systems, annotators
in evaluating detected meaning shifts, and overall, allow for assessment of the underlying hypothesis
that sense and context changes are always concurrent.
Next to evaluation,
dealing with polysemy (and homonymy) is an important issue.
For words
with multiple meanings, it can be hard to distinguish whether a presumed meaning shift is due to a
shift in the distribution of existing senses (i.e.
going from having sense-1 being dominant to sense-2
becoming much more frequent), or due to a true meaning shift or the rise of a novel sense.
Moreover,
by combining all
senses of a word in a single representation,
the granularity of the representation
becomes lower.
This is the case,
for example,
where the addition of
a sense to a word with 5 or
more existing senses might not cause the overall
averaged representation to shift significantly.
On
the other hand, by splitting representations to some extent, we can detect smaller shifts, for example
when a shift in the meaning of the noun book is not obscured by the meaning of the verb book.
This would of
course,
require word sense disambiguation,
which is a largely unsolved task in
NLP. Luckily, for this to yield benefits, disambiguation at the fine-grained sense-level is not required.
Making coarse-grained distinctions and/or simply distinguishing between homonyms could already
increase significantly the granularity of representations.
Alternatively, the disambiguation step can
be integrated in the representations, by making use of sense-aware embeddings as done for example
by Cheng and Kartsaklis (2015) and Iacobacci et al. (2015).
On a more concrete level,
the development of
meaning shift detection methods would benefit
from more comparability.
Most existing work makes use of different corpora and evaluation methods,
making it difficult to clearly assess which methods work better,
and what the effect of corpus size
and the use of certain similarity metrics is.
More detailed studies need to be carried out, focusing on
a direct comparison of different representation methods, e.g.
ones using re-initialization, alignment
by rotation, or nearest-neighbour-based methods for comparing different vector spaces.
As a final recommendation for future work, we would like to point out the importance of devel-
oping methods for detecting meaning shifts (and NLP in general),
that can be applied to multiple
languages.
In this work,
we find that a purely token-based approach already has limitations for
Dutch.
By not performing any lemmatization or compound splitting, we miss out on morphological
variation and compounds.
For morphologically rich languages, this problem might be exacerbated.
From a more practical
perspective,
one should also consider languages with fewer digital
language
resources than English.
The use of a large,
regularly updated dictionary as we do here,
or the use
of huge corpora, as in Hamilton et al. (2016), might not be portable to many other languages.

Conclusion
We ran experiments with diachronically trained word embeddings on Dutch newswire data to see
whether embeddings’
similarity across years for the same term might be a reliable indicator of
a
meaning shift in time,
as it had been at least partially observed for Italian.
Rather than finding
confirmation of
this hypothesis,
as only a couple of
cases do exhibit the desired behaviour,
our
experiments uncovered a wide range of interfering factors that we felt required in-depth investigation.
Indeed,
they constitute a set of aspects that researchers in this field must take into account when
designing experiments on the automatic detection of meaning shifts as well as when analysing results.
With the detection and discussion of such factors in this paper,
like frequency,
polysemy,
but also
representation choices, directly linked to the results that we observe on our data, we believe that we
are making an important contribution towards more robust and hopefully shared practices in the
design of experiments to detect meaning shifts based on distributed representations.
Finally, we also
75
make a practical
contribution to the development of this field by making our code and our results
publicly available:
