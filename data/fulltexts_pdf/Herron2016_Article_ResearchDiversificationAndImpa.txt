Abstract
Newcomer nations,
promoted by developmental
states,
have poured resources
into nanotechnology development,
and have dramatically increased their
nanoscience
research influence,
as measured by research citation.
Some achieved these gains by pro-
ducing significantly higher impact
papers rather than by simply producing more papers.
Those nations gaining the most
in relative strength did not
build specializations in par-
ticular
subfields,
but
instead diversified their
nanotechnology research portfolios
and
emulated the global research mix.
We show this using a panel dataset covering the nan-
otechnology research output
of
63 countries
over
12 years.
The inverse relationship
between research specialization and impact
is robust
to several
ways of measuring both
variables,
the introduction of
controls for
country identity,
the volume of
nanoscience
research output
(a proxy for a country’s scientific capability) and home-country bias in
citation,
and various attempts to reweight and split the samples of countries and journals
involved.
The results are consistent
with scientific advancement
by newcomer
nations
being better accomplished through diversification than specialization.

Introduction
Tensions between diversification and specialization are a common theme in debates over
economic development policy.
On one hand,
the standard,
static Ricardian logic of com-
parative advantage suggests that a country should concentrate its resources on producing
what it is relatively good at, utilizing the surpluses to purchase its other needs from other
countries (Feldman and Audretsch 1999).
This logic emphasizes the folly of expending
resources on activities in which the country’s performance is likely to be marginal. While
there are several possible objections to this logic (Shaikh 2007), the counterargument that
has received the most
attention in recent
years is that
activity in one area builds real
workable knowledge that
is applicable in other areas (Schubert
and Braun 1986).
Thus,
when knowledge spillovers are substantial, ignoring certain areas of activity carries a cost
in terms of lost productivity in other areas (Hidalgo et al. 2007; Hausmann et al. 2011). In
an information age,
it
is argued,
diversification,
not
specialization,
is the way forward.
Industrial
policies may be required to lean against
market
forces that
promote special-
ization (Lundberg 2007).
This logic is particularly well accepted in science and technology policy making (Lund-
berg 2007). Knowledge spillovers and transferable capabilities can, after all, exert an outsize
influence on scientific success. The benefits of scientific diversification include: risk man-
agement—specializing in scientific dead-ends is costly (Moed et al. 1995; Leydesdorff 2013);
creative and learning synergies—progress hinges on recombining existing knowledge and
techniques in novel ways (Aksnes et al. 2012; MacRoberts and MacRoberts 1996; Shapira
and Wang 2010; Braun et al. 2007); and rigor—which is enhanced by being able to assess
ideas from multiple perspectives (Leydesdorff
1998).
Yet,
it
must
be remembered that
diversification carries costs. These costs can be relatively large in countries that are new to the
scientific stage, with limited economic and human resources and small scientific communities
(Guan and Ma 2007). In such countries, diversification could lead to thinly spread pools of
scientific talent across many areas, including some in which performance is likely to be poor.
Spreading resources too thinly can reduce healthy scientific competition and quality control.
Thus, theory is inconclusive on whether national scientific diversification actually promotes
scientific success or not, especially in newcomer scientific nations.
1
Unfortunately, empirical understanding of this relationship at the national level is quite
incomplete.
2
The central purpose of this paper, therefore, is to put this relationship under
the microscope.
We focus on nanotechnology,
because it
is an area in which the gov-
ernments
of
newcomer
scientific nations
are actively seeking to push back on static
comparative advantages.
Drawing on a large body of work examining ways to measure
diversification and research impact (e.g.,
Schubert and Grupp 2011; Schubert and Braun
1986),
we establish an extremely robust positive statistical
relationship between a coun-
try’s degree of nanoscience diversification and its research impact.
Previous studies of national
scientific diversification have focused more on its causes
than its effects.
They show a clear inverse relationship between the volume of a nation’s
1
Suggesting that the case for diversification may well vary with a country’s stage of development, Imbs and
Wazciarg (2003) show that
poorer and richer countries tend to have lower levels of industrial
diversity,
relative to modestly rich countries. Similar forces could yield similar effects for scientific diversification.
2
Indeed,
despite significant efforts,
we have been unable to locate any studies of this relationship at the
national level. At the firm level, Lee et al. (2012) find that firms with more specialized research portfolios
filed more high impact
patents;
while Matusik and Fitza (2012) show that
venture capital
firms that
are
highly specialized and highly diversified were more successful than those who were moderately diversified
in taking firms they invest in public.

scientific activity and specialization—countries that published more scientific papers have
more diversified publication mixes (Pianta and Archibugi
1991;
Horlings and Van den
Besselaar 2011).
Similar results are reported for technological
diversification—countries
that patent more conduct more diverse types of R&D (Archibugi and Pianta 1992; Cant-
well
and Vertova 2004).
Thus countries and organizations diversify their scientific and
technological
portfolios as their capabilities develop.
Yet,
Cantwell
and Vertova (2004)
also argue that technological diversification has become more difficult to achieve in recent
decades, in the sense that the volume of patenting associated with a given level of patent
diversification in a cross-section of advanced countries has increased. They suggest that the
increased importance of multinational
firms (and therefore the relatively reduced impor-
tance of the developmental state) is leading to greater technological specialization. While
scientific and technological specialization are very different processes, the ever-expanding
range of
scientific research areas
and deepening international
collaboration networks
(Wagner 2008) could similarly induce nations,
especially newcomers with limited scien-
tific resources,
to specialize.
Thus,
it
is
important
to ask not
only whether
scientific
diversification is desirable (in the sense that it is associated with greater research impact),
but whether it remains feasible.
We will take on this task as well.
We will
add to the existing literature on diversification and scientific development in
several
ways.
First,
whereas the literature has focused on the relationship between the
volume of national
output
and diversification,
we show a relationship between diversifi-
cation and impact, as proxied by citations (Garfield 1979). Second, ours appears to be the
first paper to do this at the national level, and the first to do it with publication, rather than
patent data.
Third,
whereas much of the literature on the diversification–size relationship
makes static comparisons between countries,
we show a dynamic relationship between
diversification and impact over time, holding the country constant. While the relationship
between size and diversification across countries sheds light on why some countries spe-
cialize more than others (Manga
`
ni 2007), the diversification–impact relationship addresses
a policy question,
namely,
whether a given country should specialize or diversify.
Unfortunately, variations in diversification rates are unlikely to be exogenous to impact,
and we therefore do not
claim to identify the causal
effect
of diversification on impact.
However, we do document a highly robust relationship over time within countries, and rule
out
several
alternative interpretations of it.
Perhaps most
importantly,
the relationship is
observed even after controlling for countries’ changing volume of nanoscience publica-
tions. This suggests that the relationship between diversification and impact measured over
time is not driven by unmeasured developments in scientific capabilities.
Our work is subject to two important caveats.
The first is that,
as is well understood,
citation patterns provide only a proxy measure of the influence of scientific research. We
use the word impact
simply as a technical
descriptor of citation based indicators of the
relative frequency with which people report having read a particular research publication.
The second is that highly-cited research is itself only one input into national technological
advancement.
Showing that countries that pursue a more diverse mix of scientific topics
produce more highly cited work is therefore only the first stage in uncovering (or rejecting)
the view that scientific diversification is important for national technological development.
Nanotechnology development provides,
in some ways,
an ideal setting to examine the
strategies and successes of developmental states.
3
Nanotechnology, being costly, is not an
3
In keeping with previous literature,
we define the developmental
state simply as a government
that,
motivated by desire for economic advancement,
intervenes in industrial affairs (Woo-Cumings 1999).
For
our purposes,
technological affairs are an aspect of industrial ones.

obvious
area
of
natural
strength for
young,
resource-constrained
scientific
powers.
Resource requirements probably constrain both diversification into nanotechnology and
diversification amongst its various subfields. It is therefore an area in which developmental
states wishing to go beyond their static comparative advantages have had to make serious
attempts to enhance scientific effort. Moreover, while some countries have diversified their
nanotechnology research portfolios,
others have become more narrowly concentrated in
particular
areas;
and trends in research impact
also vary widely across countries.
This
permits us to measure the diversification–impact
relationship quite accurately.
The next
section of
the paper
reviews
the role of
the developmental
state in nanotechnology
development around the world to make this case.
We then proceed to data,
analysis and
conclusions.
Nanotechnology and the developmental state
In the early years of the Twenty-First
Century,
the major Twentieth Century scientific
research powers,
or
‘‘Incumbents’’—the US,
Western Europe,
Japan and Russia—have
faced intensified challenges from rapidly developing states such as China,
India,
Korea,
Brazil,
Singapore and Taiwan.
These challenges
are manifest
in these ‘‘Newcomer’’
countries’ increasing investments in research and development (R&D) and in their growing
scientific productivity,
both of
which have outstripped their
economic output
(Royal
Society of London 2011).
China has led the way here,
overtaking Japan and Europe in
terms of gross R&D expenditures and publication output in recent years (OECD 2014; Van
Noorden 2014).
Scientific development
has also been rapid in India and Brazil,
in new
emergent scientific nations in East and South-East Asia such as Korea and Singapore as
well as in some of the smaller European nations. While the Incumbents as a whole still lead
the Newcomers in investing in and reaping the performance rewards of scientific research
in terms of numbers of research articles,
citations,
and especially translation of research
science into patents and innovative products,
these gaps have begun to shrink (Zakaria
2008; King 2004; Shapira and Wang 2010; Youtie et al.
2008; Royal Society of London
2011).
4
Since roughly 2000 both Incumbents and Newcomers have targeted nanotechnology as
one of the primary growth areas of their strategic R&D activity.
The US led the way,
forming the US National
Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in 2000 as an umbrella orga-
nization to fund and coordinate the activities of several
federal
agencies responsible for
research and development
aimed at
exploiting the
groundbreaking opportunities
for
research and discovery at the first level of organization of matter,
ranging from a single
atom to 100 nm (www.nano.gov). In one of its largest long-term investments in support of
research in science and technology,
the US has pinned considerable hopes on the NNI to
maintain its world leadership in science and technology.
The framers of the NNI argued
that with potential applications in virtually every existing industry and new applications yet
to be discovered,
nanoscale science and technology would emerge as one of the major
drivers of economic growth in the first
part
of the Twenty-First
Century (Abramo et
al.
2012).
They estimated that
with industry input
the market
for
products incorporating
nanotechnology could reach $1 trillion worldwide by 2015 (M.
C.
Roco 2007).
The US
4
Iran could certainly be included in this list, given the dramatic rise in its nanotechnology research output,
which surpassed that of Brazil by 2009. However, for most of the sample period, there are too few papers
from Iran to analyze its patterns of specialization.
632

123
funding contribution to launch nanotechnology was therefore substantial ($1 billion in the
first
2 years),
and this was just
the beginning.
Annual
US government
funding for nan-
otechnology rose to $1.8 billion in 2009 and by 2010 the cumulative federal support for
NNI programs since the start in FY 2001 amounted to more than $12 billion (NNI.gov).
5
The US was soon joined by at least 60 countries in founding their own nanotechnology
initiatives,
so that
by 2008 the worldwide government support of nanotechnology initia-
tives was more than $6.3 billion (Chen and Roco 2008, Table 1-1). On top of investments
by its member states (Germany and France each committed about $3 billion to government
funded nano research between 2005–2010,
averaging 2.4 and 3.1 % respectively of their
total
government
funded
research
budgets),
the
EU allocated
$1.9
billion
during
2002–2006 for nanoscience and nanomaterials in its Framework Program 6,
and signifi-
cantly increased that
commitment
under
the Framework Program 7 (2007–13)
to $3.2
billion during 2007–10 (Commission of
the European Communities
2007;
European
Commission 2006).
Other countries have also ramped up their nanotech investments, in some cases closing
the gap with the US (Fig.
1). China has committed an average of 5.4 % of its total public
research budget to nanotechnology since 2005 compared, to an average of 1.4 % by the US
(Fig.
2).
Russia has come from nowhere to commit
a whopping $3.5 billion to nano
between 2007 and 2010,
much of it on commercialization,
constituting 3.9 % of its total
federally funded research budget.
Japan has committed 3.7 % of
its total
government-
funded research to nanotechnology since 2005,
and the corresponding commitments over
this period for other countries were: Taiwan 4 %; Singapore 3.3 %; Korea 2.9 %; and the
UK 1.9 %.
As a whole,
these efforts clearly demonstrate that
developmental
states have been
aggressively pushing innovation in nanotechnology (see,
for example,
Appelbaum et
al.
2011). These efforts are reflected in the shares of these countries’ nanoscience publications
compared to their global shares of all scientific publications. In its 2009 examination of the
top 25 countries by the share of nanotechnology-related publications, the OECD Working
Party on Nanotechnology reported that
China and Singapore had nearly three times the
share of
papers devoted to nanotechnology as compared to these countries’
respective
shares of all
publications in the ISI Web of Science database.
Japan,
Germany,
France,
Taiwan,
and the Russian Federation also had a significantly higher
share of
nanotech-
nology publications compared to all
publications (Palmberg et
al.
2009).
Overall
the
OECD study reported that growth in nanotechnology publications outstripped the growth
rate of all publications in the Web of Science database.
This paper studies the scientific output that has been supported by this wave of largely
state sponsored research. Previous studies indicate that while the national funding efforts of
Newcomer nations have fueled a large increase in the number of nanotechnology publi-
cations by those nations,
the average impact of their work as measured by citations still
trails the US and several European nations (Youtie et al. 2008; Guan and Ma 2007; Jin and
Rousseau 2005; Kostoff 2012; Leydesdorff and Wagner 2009; Leydesdorff 2013; Editorial,
2008).
As we demonstrate in this paper,
while the impact of nanoscience and technology
publications of Newcomer nations lagged behind the US in the launch phase of federally
funded nanotechnology (2000–2005/07), the gap between the Incumbents and some of the
5
To the extent that research is cheaper in lower-income countries, the dollar figures provided in this section
overstate the research budgets of high-relative to low-income countries.
There is no index comparing the
cost
of
scientific research across countries that
would permit
us to compare these budgets in terms of
purchasing power.
Scientometrics (2016) 109:629–659
633
123
Newcomers has been closing rapidly,
and other Newcomer nations are making up for a
lack of impact
with rapid growth in the quantity of research publication.
We especially
show that
several
Newcomer
nations
have
rapidly diversified their
nanotechnology
research efforts, so that the proportions of their research publications that fall in different
nanotechnology subfields are converging rapidly towards global
norms.
Other countries
remained specialized in particular subfields, or became more specialized. This diversity of
trends in research impact
and in specialization/diversification permits us to study the
relationship between changes in diversification and research impact.
Given the public
resource commitments just documented, it is important to understand the effectiveness of
countries’ nanotechnology research strategies.

Data and methods for bibliometric analysis and topic modeling
Bibliometric analyses of nanotechnology have been performed using a variety of query
techniques for selecting nanotechnology-relevant documents from the Thompson Reuters
(formerly ISI) Web of Science (WoS) database (Glanzel et al.
2003; Noyons et al.
2003;
Zitt
and Bassecoulard 2006;
Mogoutov and Kahane 2007;
Leydesdorff and Zhou 2007;
Porter et al.
2008; Pouris 2007; Onel et al.
2011; Mehta et al.
2012).
The WoS contains
English language metadata records for nearly 50 million scholarly research articles,
pro-
viding a convenient and rich resource for scientometric analysis. Data for the present study
were collected using the query method in Kostoff et al. (2006), Lenoir and Herron (Lenoir
and Herron 2009) and Mehta et
al.
(2012).
For the present
study the Kostoff query was
used to retrieve the metadata records
covering all
564,993 relevant
nanoscience and
nanotechnology articles spanning 1 January 2000 through 1 May 2012 from the WoS one
country at a time for 68 countries (reduced to 63 once we drop five countries that had no
nano publications in one or more years).
Data were extracted from the metadata records
and organized into a flat-file format containing 564,970 useable records.
The query in Kostoff
et
al.
(2006)
was chosen at
the time the data were collected
because it was developed iteratively, has been widely used, incorporates expert input, and
requires no citation network data.
Huang et
al.
(2011)
note that
several
outcomes of
bibliometric research on nanotechnology are qualitatively invariant to the choice of lexical
query used to generate the data they use.
This said,
while the Kostoff query produces
excellent
retrieval
performance,
it
could result
in under-representation of
emergent
nanoscale subjects described entirely by novel keywords. In practice, such problems should
be reduced by the fact that most nano papers are positively identified by more than one of
our
search terms.
For
example,
our
dataset
does capture the enormous growth rate in
graphene publications since 2004,
even though graphene is not one of our search terms.
Nevertheless,
some under-representation of
emergent
fields is likely and future studies
should examine the issue using data collected using other queries.
In order to examine trends in research specialization and in particular to track research
trends by nanotechnology subfield, we introduced topic modeling of our original data set.
Topics in the nanotechnology papers represented by WoS metadata records were identified
and assigned using Latent
Dirichlet
Analysis (LDA),
a machine learning technique for
identifying topics (Blei
et
al.
2003)
that
has been widely used as the basis for
topic
discovery tasks across diverse collections of
documents,
including collections of
news
articles
(Newman et
al.
2006),
broad digital
libraries
(Mimno and McCallum 2007),
general scientific literature (Blei and Lafferty 2007; Hall et al. 2008), and nanotechnology
(Porter and Zhang 2012; Zhang et al. 2007). LDA is used in the present study to identify
latent topics in the nanotechnology literature and subsequently assign the most likely topic
to each paper.
The process of using LDA to discover topics within nanotechnology has
been done in four steps: (1) corpus preparation; (2) topic learning; (3) topic naming; and
(4) topic assignment.
A straightforward procedure to prepare the document
corpus was undertaken.
Text
fields from document
metadata (title,
abstract,
keywords and Keywordplus

) were con-
catenated for each document, parsed into unigrams, converted to all lower case, and used to
represent
document
content.
Unigrams parsed from the four
metadata text
fields were
filtered using two stopword lists: from the NLTK software package (the ‘‘English’’ stop-
word list); and ISI Web of Knowledge stopword list (http://images.webofknowledge.com/
Scientometrics (2016) 109:629–659
635
123
WOK45/help/WOK/ht_stopwd.html).
All
terms occurring only once in the entire collec-
tion were also removed,
as were terms occurring in more than 75 % of the documents.
Using the GENSIM python software package (R
ˇ
ehu
˚
r
ˇ
ek and Sojka 2010), we generated a
‘‘bag of words’’ representation from the resulting list
of document-text
tuples,
and then
four
different
topic models were learned using the Gensim LDA model,
each model
corresponding to a fixed number of topics (k = 5,…,8). The selected range for k privileges
interpretability over improved likelihoods (Chang et al.
2009) with k = 8 considered the
upper
end of
the range of
human interpretability (Miller
1956;
Cowan 2001).
Every
document
was used in the learning phase.
For each topic Gensim output
a list
of most
identifying terms,
and we labeled each topic based on a combination of those terms.
Each of our four learned models was then applied to each document in order to output
from GENSIM an array of 1 to k topic assignment scores for each document.
Each topic
assignment
score indicates the posterior
probability of
the document
belonging to that
topic;
given that
LDA is a mixed-model,
papers can belong to more than one topic.
A
document
may receive only one non-zero probability score,
indicating it
belongs in one
topic,
or it
may receive as many as five non-zero scores,
indicating some likelihood the
document
belongs to all
five topics.
In the present
study,
in order to partition nanotech-
nology into topic fields
in a simple way,
we removed mixed assignment
simply by
choosing for each document the topic assignment with the highest score. Nonetheless, it is
crucial to point out that the 560,000 papers in the present study do frequently belong to
more than one topic.
The topics do overlap,
as they should,
because the nanotechnology
topics we are calling ‘‘subfields’’ do not represent distinct disciplinary entities.
The topic
assignment of each paper merely shows the most central topical tendency of a paper even
though a paper may be relevant to more than one topic.
For example,
a paper labeled as
‘‘thin films’’ may also be about a nano-optoelectronics application,
or a paper labeled as
‘‘nanoparticles & self-assembly’’ may also be,
perhaps to a lesser extent,
about
‘‘nano-
medicine/nanobio’’. The label selected for a paper is simply the one to which the paper has
the highest probability of belonging.
Each of these four models was then assessed in terms of their precision and recall. We
found that the optimal models using each of k = 6, 7 and 8, included some extremely small
and large categories,
with indistinct
clustering.
The optimal
model
using k = 5 did not
have these features.
We therefore selected the five-topic model,
manually choosing
appropriate names for each cluster,
shown in Table 1.
6
Figure 3 shows trends in the number of publications and the relative citation rates
7
in
each of our five fields.
Several
trends are clear,
all
of which will
influence our choices
regarding the construction and interpretation of our measures of specialization and impact:
(1) citation rates vary significantly across fields, and, with the exception of particles, papers
in bigger fields are generally cited less often;
(2) the field of nanobio is growing most
rapidly;
and (3) citation rates to nanobio papers (a nascent
field) drop as the number of
nanobio papers accelerates, while relative citation rates to Tubes and Dots (which provides
some of the knowledge base for nanobio) increase.
6
We have re-run the analyses appearing in the next
section for k = 8,
and the results did not
change
qualitatively. The only exception is Fig. 8, which involves the Hirschman Herfindahl Index of concentration.
The HHI is known to be sensitive to changes in the number of subfields across which concentration is
measured.
7
The citation rate for a subfield in some year is the ratio between the average citation rate of papers
published in that subfield that year and the average citation rate of all nanotechnology papers published that
year.

Analysis
Our analysis proceeds in three phases.
First,
we examine trends in the scientific ‘‘influ-
ence’’ of 11 countries that are particularly important sources of nanotechnology research.
We ask whether the Newcomers are rising by improving the quantity or average impact of
their research. This is followed by an analysis of the relative strengths of these nations, as
proxied by shares of publications and citations, in the five major nanotechnology subfields.
Finally,
we examine whether highly specialized nano research portfolios are a recipe for
improving the impact
of a country’s research or whether either of the two strategies of
diversification—conformity and deconcentration–pays higher dividends.

Scientific influence: quantity versus impact
Following the same intuition as King (2004) we measure the relative ‘‘influence’’ of a
country’s ideas in a given year by the share of all citations to papers published that year
that
are to papers involving at
least
one author
from that
country.
8,9
Of
course,
true
scientific influence goes beyond academic citations,
and citations are an imperfect
indi-
cator
of
the origin of
scientific ideas (MacRoberts and MacRoberts 1996;
Leydesdorff
1998). In keeping with scientometric precedent, we are working with imperfect but useful
proxies for academic influence (Kostoff 1998).
10
This
simple share-of-citations
measure of
influence is
attractive because it
can be
perfectly decomposed to show whether a nation’s influence varies over time due to changes
in the ‘‘quantity’’
and ‘‘impact’’
of
its research.
In keeping with previous studies (T.
Schubert
and Grupp 2011;
A.
Schubert
and Braun 1986;
Moed et
al.
1995,
p.
399),
we
proxy for the academic impact
of a country’s research in a given year using a national
relative citation index (RCI)—the ratio of
the average citation rate of
nanotechnology
papers published that
year involving this country to the average citation rate of all
nan-
otechnology papers published in that year.
11
We measure the country’s (relative) research
quantity as the share of publications in that year that involve an author from this country.

Taking logs and time differencing (2) then expresses the growth rate of influence as the
sum of the growth rates of ‘‘quantity’’ and ‘‘impact’’:
8
Using a share-of-citations measure allows for the fact the fact that more recent publications have had less
time to be cited and compete for recognition in a larger pool of publications. We emphasize that this is a
measure if relative influence, increases in which only tell us that the number of citations to papers involving
country c have grown more rapidly than have citations to all papers in the field.
9
One obvious drawback to this simple share-of-citations measure is that it gives greater weight to inter-
nationally coauthored papers (Aksnes 2006). Shares of citations and publications measures recalculated to
attribute papers to countries in inverse proportion to the number of countries that authored each paper yield
the same qualitative findings as the figures and table presented here, indicating that our results are not driven
by an over-counting of internationally coauthored papers.
Fractional
attribution of internationally coau-
thored papers yields only two minor changes: (1) The growth over time in China’s RCI is slightly more
pronounced, because the citation rates of Chinese- only papers have converged on those of papers involving
authors from both China and other countries; (2) Russia’s relative RCI drops with fractional attribution, as
its internationally collaborative papers are more highly cited than Russian only papers.
10
Some countries may tend to cite their own work, and lower-income countries are more likely to cite work
in lower ranked journals (Didegah et al. 2012). There is little we can do to correct our estimates of influence
and impact for this with the data available, but we will check that our estimates of the relationship between
diversification and impact are plausibly robust to such problems.
11
We tried using a re-based impact factor (RBI—see Sect.
3.3) as a proxy for impact. The RBI normalizes
citations across subfields by subfield norms and then takes the country’s publication-share-weighted average
of these normalize citation across sub fields (King 2004).
Rebasing has imperceptible effects on Fig.
5,
indicating that results in this section are not sensitive to the weighting of citations in different subfields.

Figure 4 shows the evolution of the shares of publications.
Incumbents have a larger
scale than the Newcomers, and Chinese output is measured on its own (right) axis, given
that it is now many times larger than that of any other country among the Newcomers. The
Figure makes
clear
that
in quantity terms,
the Newcomers
are rising relative to the
Incumbents (especially the EU,
US and Japan).
China’s growth is particularly arresting,
while India has picked up speed.
The Brazilian and Canadian shares remain flat,
so their
output has effectively grown at the same rate as that of the literature itself. South Korea and
Taiwan, the earliest powers among the Newcomers, are still growing, but have decelerated,
while Singapore’s output has grown slightly faster than has the global literature.
Figure 5 shows trends in relative citation rates. A more mixed picture emerges here. Of
the Incumbents,
the EU has edged up slightly,
and the US is rapidly losing its advantage
over other countries. Japan is making gains, while Russia is not. Among the Newcomers,

Singapore stands out
for
its remarkable improvements in relative citation rates,
while
China has climbed strongly to equality with the global
average.
Taiwan has made some
gains,
South Korea and India have roughly held their
ground,
and Brazil’s
RCI
has
declined somewhat.
Figure 6 shows the evolution of influence,
while Table 2 decomposes its growth rate
using identity (2).
For example,
the bottom three rows of Table 2 indicate that EU influ-
ence declined by 24.1 %,
and would have declined 36.9 % due to its reduced share of
publications if the relative citation rate of its publications had not
improved,
pulling its
influence back up by 12.8 %.
The results clearly reveal
the rise of the Newcomers.
Canada is the only Incumbent
whose influence did not decline appreciably relative to the rest of the world, and Brazil is
the only Newcomer country whose relative influence did decline. These trends in influence
are mirrored in the contributions of quantity,
which reflect the growing numbers of pub-
lications by Newcomer countries observed in Fig.
4.
The relative decline of the Incumbents and the rise of the Newcomers in influence have,
however,
taken radically different forms in different countries.
Amongst the Incumbents,
two-thirds of
the loss of
US relative influence owes to its declining edge in research
impact, and Russia has also lost influence in both quantity and impact terms. The EU and
Canada, on the other hand, have offset a large portion of the quantity loss through impact
gains.
Japan,
despite registering the largest
contribution of impact
growth in the Incum-
bents,
could not make up for its even larger loss in quantity.
Amongst the Newcomers,
however,
China,
Singapore and Taiwan are increasing their
influence via both the impact and quantity of their research. Less than a tenth of Taiwanese
gains come from impact improvements, compared with around one-third of Chinese gains
and two-thirds of Singaporean gains.
Thus,
the rise of the Newcomers is not
simply a
quantity story.
This said,
it
has been entirely a quantity story for both South Korea and
India, whose governments may wish to examine their policy differences with Singapore to
seek ways of increasing research impact. Brazil,
unlike the rest of the Newcomers, is not
gaining in influence. There is, therefore, significant variation in nation’s trends in impact.
We will explore this variation in Sect.
3.3.
Next,
to gain a sharper impression of the activities of world-class scientists,
and to
possibly reduce problems of self-citation and home-country bias in citation,
we focus on
articles published in more prestigious journals. The appendix presents these results, which
use a subset
of
journals with Eigenfactor
scores of
0.045 or
higher.
12
This restriction
eliminates roughly half of our sample. All of the major movements in influence, quantity
and impact mentioned above are intact in a comparison to the figures and table presented
above. The biggest changes are that China and South Korea register larger improvements
in relative citation rates to their papers in prestigious journals, suggesting a core cadre of
high-quality researchers
that
has
gained in strength;
while India’s
apparent
gains
in
influence seem to come from lower quality journals.
Conversely,
among the Incumbents,
the most obvious change is that the US’s share of publications did not shrink by nearly as
much in the prestigious journals, while its relative citation rate shrank much faster in these
journals. Thus, while roughly one-third of the US’s loss of relative influence in the general
12
Eigenfactor scores as reported by Web of Science, 2010 Journal Rankings. The cutoff presented here for
prestigious journals was provided by nanotechnologist
at
a top-ranked engineering department
who we
asked to identify the lowest ranked journal they would support their graduate students submitting papers to.
Lowering the bar does not alter our results qualitatively.
640
Scientometrics (2016) 109:629–659
123
journal pool is due to a loss of quantity,
roughly two-thirds of its slightly smaller loss of
influence in prestigious journals is due to reduced relative citation rates.
The implications of these trends, together, are clear. The Newcomers are rising in both
quantity and impact.
While their nanotechnologists still face challenges publishing in the
most prestigious journals, when they do, they tend to make a serious and growing impact.
Trends in research specialization
A long literature in scientometrics and economics has developed measures of trade and
research ‘‘specialization’’ (Balassa 1965;
Hidalgo and Hausmann 2009;
Avila-Robinson
and Miyazaki 2012; Schubert and Braun 1986; Schubert and Grupp 2011). Specialization
is most
often measured at
the level
of specific countries and subfields (for example,
we
may measure Korea’s degree of specialization in nano-electronics).
The most
common
scientometric indicator of country c’s specialization in subfield f in year t is its Revealed

is the

and Grupp
2011).
This is greater than one whenever country c specializes in subfield f.
It is also possible to aggregate these measures to a national level to quantify two notions
of a country’s research specialization: the extent to which its research mix is concentrated
in certain fields, and its non-conformity to the global research mix. In the least concentrated
research mix, 20 % of papers would fall into each of our five categories. Conformity is the
strategy of
emulating the global
average distribution of
publication,
which is approxi-
mately 8.2 % nanobio/nanomedicine,
15.1 % quantum dots/carbon nanotubes,
29.5 %
nanofilms,
26.9 % nanoparticles,
and 20.3 % nanoelectronics (Table 1).
Figure 7 shows
why these two notions of specialization are distinct, especially when global research effort
is unevenly distributed across fields. While concentration and non-conformity are notions
of
specialization,
their
opposites,
de-concentration and conformity capture
research
diversification.

We have examined four measures of
non-
conformity to ensure that our results are robust to our choice of measure. First, the easiest
to
interpret
measure
of
non-conformity
(UNCTAD 2006)
is
NonConformity

.
This ranges in value from zero (total
conformity:
the subfield
composition of c’s publication mix is exactly the same as that
of other countries) to a
theoretical maximum near one (total non-conformity: c publishes in a field if and only if
other countries do not
publish in it).
Our second measure,
referred to as a Chi
square
measure,
is

(Pianta
and Archibugi
1991;
Andersson and
Ejermo 2008).
Our third and fourth non-conformity measures (see Cantwell and Vertova
2004) are the coefficients of variation across subfields within a country and year of RLA
and of
RLAM : 2RLA/2RLA(RLA ? 1).
(RLA ? 1).
RLAM modifies
RLA so that
it
ranges from zero to two and is symmetric around one.
We refer to these coefficients of
variation collectively as the CV measures of non-conformity.
Our qualitative findings are
all
robust to the choice of measure.
Nonconformity is the easiest
measure to relate intu-
itively to the underlying subfield shares, and the two CV measures, being scaled by within
country means,
explode in countries
with high specialization in some small
subfield
13
Four out
of the five concentration measures (C4,
C8,
C20 and the Gini
Coefficient) studied by Van
Zeebroeck et al.
(2006) are not suitable when the number of subfields is small (Khramova et al.
2013).

(Cantwell and Vertova 2004, p. 515). We therefore focus on non-conformity results using
the NonConformity measure for the rest
of the paper.
Results using v
2
and the two CV
measures are available on request.
Figure 8 tracks concentration over time for our main countries using a common scale.
The data indicate that the Newcomers have been more concentrated in particular areas of
nanoscience than the Incumbents.
However,
this situation is changing rapidly,
as the
Newcomers begin to spread their research portfolios into formerly under-represented fields.
In conjunction with the rapid growth in research quantity (and for some,
impact),
this
smoothing indicates that
the Newcomers are rapidly developing capacities in new areas.
This is nowhere more evident than in Singapore. We will examine what these areas might
be,
presently.
Meanwhile,
among the Incumbents,
the US,
EU and Canada are holding
steady near the minimum possible level of concentration (0.2),
but Japan and Russia are
building broader capacities.
Figure 9 examines NonConformity,
which displays very different
trends across coun-
tries.
The US and EU stand apart
for having developed more non-conforming research
mixes over the duration of our study.
By 2011,
the US is the major power with the least
conformist
research mix.
On the other hand,
the research mixes among the major New-
comers have been converging on the global
mix.
Once again,
this process is extremely
pronounced in Singapore,
which began as the most non-conforming emerging nanotech-
nology power,
and virtually erased any trace of idiosyncrasy within a decade.
National
trends
in
conformity
using
v
2
and
CV are
qualitatively
identical
to
those
using
NonConformity.
14
Figure 10 looks more deeply at what key countries have specialized in. Apparently, US
diversification is led by its movement into photo-electronics, and its extremely high RLA
in nanobio. The EU is specializing in photo-electronics even more noticeably, but moving
out
of nanobio.
Meanwhile the convergence amongst
the four Asian countries depicted
comes from rapid gains in nanobio,
movement
away from concentrating principally in
films, and some gains in photo-electronics. Once again, this transition has been most rapid

Some countries do rank differently by CV and by Nonconformity. As noted, this is unsurprising given that
coefficients of variation are very sensitive to changes in the country-mean value of RLA and RLAM.

and prominent in Singapore. By 2011, Singapore has RLAs of close to one in all five fields.
Thus,
the impression is that the US and EU are opening up new frontiers in nanobio and
electronics while other countries are following them with a lag.
To summarize, Fig.
8 indicates that the Newcomers are becoming less concentrated, but
that the US and EU are already near the minimum possible level of concentration; Fig.
9
indicates that
the Newcomers are becoming more conforming as the US and EU are
becoming less conforming; and Fig.
10 similarly shows that the US and EU are special-
izing as the major Asian powers are diversifying.
We interpret
this as a reflection of a
process of scientific catch-up,
with the Newcomers attempting to diversify by making up
ground in areas such as nanobio, and the US and EU attempting to maintain a competitive
edge in nanobio and electronics—two areas in which their industries have been investing
heavily (Roco et al.
2010;
van Zeebroeck et
al.
2006; Raje 2011).
Meanwhile the New-
comers are attempting to make inroads into these areas.

Are specialization and impact related?
We now use simple regressions to examine the relationship between proxies for research
specialization (concentration and non-conformity) and research impact.
We do this at the
level of nations,
using variants of the following regression specification:
Impact
c;t
¼ a
c
þ a
t
þ b  Specialization
c;t
þ cX
c;t
þ e
c;t
ð3Þ
Each variant
involves one of
the five measures of
national
scientific specialization
analyzed previously (HHI, NonConformity, v
2
, and the two CVmeasures), and one of three
different
proxy measures of scientific impact.
The first
proxy for
impact
is simply the
relative citation index (RCI)
discussed in Sect.
3.1.
The RCI
will
be too generous to
countries that are focused on disciplines that tend to have higher citation rates. This could
lead to a spurious relationship between conformity and national research impact, because a
country that moves into highly cited disciplines will tend to receive more citations even if
the intrinsic quality of its work remains unchanged, simply because there are more citing
papers in highly cited disciplines. To deal with inter-discipline differences in citations, we
use the weighted average of a country’s rebased impact
factors in each discipline (King
2004). The rebased impact factors are the weighted-average of the citation rates of papers
in each country,
discipline,
and year,
divided by the global
average citation rate in that
discipline and year; the weights are the share of the country’s publications that year in each
discipline.
We refer
to this national
aggregate as the country’s rebased impact
factor
(RBI
c,t
) in that year.
Our third impact measure (Top5
c,t
) is simply the share of all publi-
cations by that
country that
are among the most
highly cited 5 % of
papers in their
discipline that
year.
This corrects for
differences
in citation norms
across disciplines
because it applies discipline-specific citation rankings rather than citation levels. Insofar as
it is unlikely that a paper could make it to the top 5 % in its discipline on the strength of
friendly citations,
it
should also reduce problems arising from authors citing their com-
patriots’ work at a higher rate and other forms of strategic citation.
As there could be disagreement regarding how to normalize citation rates, we check our
results for robustness to four different normalization strategies. First, we normalize taking
as disciplines the 135 subject
categories reported by Web of Science that
appear in our
dataset.
Second,
we normalize within each of the eight
topics discussed in footnote 8.
Third, we normalize within the five topics used in Sect.
3.2. Fourth, the RCI is simply the
limiting case of an RBI normalized within only one category—nanotechnology itself. Our
results are invariant
to the normalization strategy used.
While it
may be preferable to
normalize citations to reflect the citation behavior of the citing article or journal (Waltman
and van Eck 2013), we lack the data this would require and so leave this robustness check
to future researchers.
Critically,
all regressions employ country fixed-effects (a
c
) and allow for the average
impact
of countries’ nanotechnology papers to vary over the years,
as the international
competition and citation norms
change.
We correct
for
time using either
11 dummy
variables corresponding to the years in our
sample (a
t
),
or
[in a restricted version of
Eq.
(3)] a linear time trend in the year of publication. The country fixed-effects control for
all
national
characteristics that
remain constant
over the time-period of our study (e.g.,
many cultural,
historical,
and geographic variables).
Thus,
the inclusion of country fixed
effects and controls for time helps us to hold the country constant, and examine its relative
scientific impact over time as it became more or less specialized. We do this because from
a policy maker’s perspective it
may be less relevant,
for example,
that
the US is more
646
Scientometrics (2016) 109:629–659
123
highly cited than other countries and also more specialized.
What
matters is whether a
given country is likely to do better when it specializes.
While the fixed effects control for country-specific omitted variables that remain con-
stant
over time,
growth in countries’ scientific capacity or other time-varying character-
istics could lead to spurious relationships between diversification and impact if we do not
correct
for them.
The key assumption in a fixed effect
model
is that
X
c,t
is sufficiently
comprehensive to capture such characteristics.
For example, the development of capacity
could both permit countries to pursue a wider array of scientific activities and also increase
impact.
To examine this possibility, we also experiment with controls for the share of all
nanoscience publications in a year that come from that country. While adequate panel data
on scientific funding are not available, we anticipate that this measure of research quantity
will proxy for it.
To further reduce the risk that a bias towards citing papers by one’s compatriots could
inflate our measures of impact, we also correct in several specifications for the share of all
papers in the sample in the subsequent years that involve an author for this country.
We
anticipated,
correctly,
that
this variable would be a positive and statistically significant
determinant of citation.
A further step is to reduce the sample to papers appearing in top
journals (defined in ‘‘Scientific influence: quantity versus impact’’ section).
Table 3 provides the estimates of b for 80 versions of this regression. The versions are
distinguished by the following choices: the measures for specialization and impact, the set
of journals whose articles are in the sample; the sets of countries included in the sample
and the relative weightage given to each country in the regression; the manner in which we
correct for time; and the other control variables included. The reported regressions use HHI
or NonConformity to proxy for specialization,
and using RCI and two versions of RBI to
proxy for impact.
The versions of RBI result
from normalizing citation rates within 135
disciplines,
and within 5 topics.
Results using the v
2
and CVmeasures to proxy for spe-
cialization, and normalizing citation rates within 8 topics are almost identical qualitatively,
and are available on request.
The most
obvious feature of
the results in this table is that
specialization is never
positively and significantly associated with impact.
Indeed,
across
a wide variety of
specifications, the relationship is usually negative and highly significant. While results for
TOP5 are not
always statistically significant,
they are always negative when they are
significant.
15
Results in rows 1–2 indicate that
specialization is associated with significantly lower
impact,
no matter how specialization and impact
are measured,
or the set
of journals in
which the articles appeared. The regressions in rows 3–6 drop country weights, so that, for
example,
Algeria’s experience is given equal weight to the US’s experience.
The regres-
sions in these four
rows also include controls for
the country’s share of
nanoscience
publications that year. If diversification is associated with impact because it proxies for the
size of the country’s nanoscience program, the coefficient on this proxy for size should be
positive. The coefficients (not shown) are all statistically insignificant when the size proxy
is introduced on its own (regressions in rows 3–4) and negative when future corrections for
future research publication are introduced (regressions
in rows
5–6).
Moreover,
the
15
We have chosen not to present estimates using Top5 because the measure is censored at zero. Estimates
from Tobit models with country fixed effects are not consistent, due to the incidental parameters problem.
We have,
however,
analyzed the behavior of Top5 using linear regressions with fixed effects (ignoring
censoring), and the results are qualitatively identical to those using RBI and RCI, although the coefficient on
the diversification measure is sometimes less statistically significant.
Tobit
models without
country fixed
effects yield negative and highly significant coefficients on the diversification measure.

Countries are ‘rising’ if their share of global nano publications displayed a significant upwards trend. They are ‘Deconcentrating’ (‘conforming’) if their HHI (non-conformity
index) displays a significant downwards trend.

Scientometrics (2016) 109:629–659
651
123
negative relationship between impact
and specialization persists in rows 3–6,
indicating
that it is a feature of prolific and non-prolific countries alike, and is probably not driven by
a failure to correct for national trends in unobserved scientific capacity. Rows 5–8 add our
correction for
countries’
future publication shares.
This variable enters positively and
significantly, consistent with the existence of a home-country bias in citation, but does not
eliminate the inverse relationship with specialization, implying that this relationship is not
an artifact of home-country bias.
Finally, to accommodate the possibility that any connection between specialization and
impact
is
the spurious result
of
rising scientific powers’
natural
tendency to develop
strengths in new and unusual fields as they do so, we divided the sample in three different
ways.
To do this,
we conducted separate regressions for
each country of
each of
the
following on a linear time trend:
the country’s share of publications that
year,
its non-
conformity index,
and its
HHI
index.
We then categorized countries
whose trend in
publication share was positive and significant as rising (the rest are classified as not rising),
those whose Non-conformity index trended downwards significantly as conforming (the
rest
are
nonconforming),
and those
whose
HHI
trended significantly downwards
as
deconcentrating (vs.
concentrating).
In assigning countries to categories,
we require the
trend coefficients to be significant
at
only the 25 % level,
reflecting our
lack of
prior
expectation on the null that there is/isn’t a time trend, and the small sample size. Table 4
lists
countries according to these categories.
As required for
this robustness test,
the
categories capture distinct aspects of science development, so that, for example, the rising
countries include some that are nonconforming and deconcentrating. It should therefore be
difficult
to attribute any negative association between specialization and impact
within
these groups to some omitted secular trend in scientific capacity.
Rows 9–10 of
Table 3 confirm a fairly robust
statistically significant
negative rela-
tionship between specialization and impact
amongst
the countries whose research mixes
are beginning to conform to global norms.
Among those countries whose research mixes
are becoming less conformist (rows 11–12), this general relationship also appears in high
quality journals,
but
not
in the wider
pool.
Together,
the results from rows 9–12 are
consistent with the view that conformity yields benefits that remain after countries begin to
develop a more specialized research mix.
Rows 13–14 confirm an inverse relationship
between the HHI and our impact
measures among deconcentrating nations.
Conversely,
Rows 15–16 reveal more limited evidence of the trend among the concentrating nations.
Together,
rows 13–16 are therefore consistent
with diversification yielding benefits that
remain after countries begin to concentrate on specific areas. Meanwhile, the fact that the
relationship is only significant amongst those countries whose research mixes became less
conformist
(Rows
11–12)
and less
concentrated (Rows
15–16)
when the sample is
restricted to papers appearing in the best journals, suggests that it is particularly damaging
for a country’s top scientific performers to become more specialized.
Rows 17–20 confirm the inverse relationship fairly strongly in rising and non-rising
countries alike.
The large majority of these results, and every comparison of these results between good
journals and the general
pool,
are consistent
with the position that
top-class science is
achieved through diversification,
not specialization.
We have corrected in three ways for
the possibility that some countries’ relative research impact is boosted by a familiarity bias
in citation, with no effect on the finding. We have checked whether this finding is driven by
rising scientific powers that
reduced the concentration and increased the conformity of
their
research mixes—however
the relationship still
survives in the best
journals even
when they are excluded.
The relationship is observed in countries with large and small
652
Scientometrics (2016) 109:629–659
123
publication volumes alike.
And,
perhaps most importantly,
it
is observed even when we
control for countries’ shares of nanoscience publications that year.
Conclusions
We have studied trends in countries’ nanotechnology research volumes, impact, influence
and composition,
making both analytical and descriptive contributions.
Analytically,
we exploit
variations in countries’ trajectories in terms of nanoscience
diversification and citation rates (a proxy for scientific impact) to study the relationship
between these two variables over time. We have shown that nations more often improved
their
nanotechnology research impact
when they conformed to the
nanotechnology
research portfolio of other nations and when they did not concentrate in a few subfields.
This result is robust to corrections for the volume of scientific activity, home-country bias
in citation, variations in citation rates across subfields, the exclusion of lower tier journals
and various types of countries,
and the choice of measures for impact and specialization.
This is all consistent with diversification being preferable to specialization, for purposes of
enhancing impact.
16
One caveat
on a causal
interpretation of this result
is that
we could not
control
for
measured resource commitments: countries that put more financial resources and personnel
into work on nanoscience are likely to be able to sustain more and more unusual research-
foci,
and to produce
higher-impact
science.
Unfortunately,
cross-country,
over-time
measures of these variables are too sparse and crude for us to examine this issue statis-
tically. Nevertheless,
we have shown that the diversification-impact relationship is robust
to corrections for countries’ shares of nanoscience publications over time,
which should
capture the effects of these changing resource commitments, and to different weighting and
sample selection schemes.
Our further contributions are as follows: We show that research in nanotechnology in
both Incumbent
and Newcomer
nations has clearly picked up in recent
years,
as their
governments have poured resources into the endeavor.
Amongst the Incumbents,
the EU
maintained a lead in research quality, despite seeing a decline in its share in publications.
This may owe to the synergies resulting from more centralized, coordinated, and focused
efforts by the European Commission and its member states.
Russia has yet
to realize a
return on its recent
huge investment
in nanotechnology.
Japan seems to hold on to its
strength in quality, although its relative decline in quantity is quite significant. The US has
lost relative influence not only because of quantity effects,
but also because of declining
relative citation rates.
Conversely,
the Newcomers,
(save Brazil),
have increased their research output faster
than the Incumbents,
and some of them have also gained on the Incumbents in research
impact.
China,
Singapore,
and Taiwan have gained in both quantity and impact,
while
India and South Korea have primarily advanced in terms of
quantity.
These advances
16
Brazil provides an illustrative example.
While Brazil is now developing a research mix that resembles
that of the rest of the world,
it had,
until at least 2005,
focused on nanobio and alternative energy appli-
cations, not only within nanotechnology but also across all of science and technology (Fink et al. 2012). As
its nanotechnology research mix has become more concentrated, its research impact has declined—the only
of our six Newcomer nations for which this is the case.
Scientometrics (2016) 109:629–659
653
123
reflect the emphasis of the Newcomers on nanotechnology,
following the lead of the US
NNI,
and reflected in the spending trends we document.
What emerges from our work, then, is a picture of a global nano-scientific playing field
that
is becoming more uniform,
and is doing so along several
dimensions.
Newcomer
scientists are converging on the Incumbents not
only in the amount
and impact
of their
research,
but also in the composition and diversity of their research portfolios.
Research production and impact
is just
one piece of
the puzzle.
Governments are
typically interested in outcomes further downstream. Future studies will therefore need to
incorporate other measures of technological success and better understand their relation-
ship to scientific diversification.
