Abstract 
Identifying relevant studies from the entire 
scientific literature is an important task in bi-
omedical research. Past efforts have incorpo-
rated semantically recognized biological enti-
ties and medical ontologies into biomedical 
literature search. However, semantic relations 
are largely overlooked by biomedical search 
engines. In this work, we aim to discover 
synonymous 
biomedical 
semantic 
relations 
between entities and explore their uses in 
query 
(semantics) 
understanding 
for 
im-
proved 
retrieval 
performance. 
Specifically, 
we discover synonymous semantic relations 
from PubMed queries and apply them to que-
ry expansion and specification. In these two 
real-world scenarios, better PubMed retrieval 
effectiveness, in terms of recall and precision, 
can be achieved, demonstrating the utility of 
our proposed approach. 
1
Introduction 
PubMed is widely used by millions of users on a 
daily basis for seeking scholarly publications in 
biology and life sciences. Recent studies show 
that a significant portion of PubMed queries are 
entity specific (i.e. entity searches) (Neveol et 
al., 2011; Huang and Lu, 2016). 
Domain-specific 
search 
engines, 
such 
as 
PubMed, typically handle queries with domain 
knowledge in mind. For example, PubMed in-
corporates Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to 
retrieve documents associated with query’s se-
mantic meaning than just keyword matches as in 
biomedicine it is common for concepts to appear 
in different forms in user queries and scholarly 
publications (Lu et al. 2009). However, PubMed 
can still suffer from mismatches between docu-
ment and query words when an information need 
involves entity semantic relations (Baumgartner 
et al., 2007). 
Consider the query 
chlorthalidone vs hydrochloro-
thiazide
and 
chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide
. 
Semantically similar as they are, PubMed returns 
twice 
more relevant documents for the latter, 
clearly overlooking the semantics of the general 
terms of 
vs
and 
versus
during its search. Unfortu-
nately, 
such 
performance 
difference 
resulting 
from different query formulations can lead to 
different levels of user satisfaction and different 
user experience with PubMed. 
In light of this, we propose a framework where 
we first understand user query’s semantics by 
discovering 
synonymous 
patterns 
among 
user 
queries (e.g. patterns 
CHEMICAL vs CHEMICAL
and 
CHEMICAL versus CHEMICAL
) for entity relations of 
interest. We then apply these learned synony-
mous patterns in query expansion to improve 
retrieval 
effectiveness 
for 
entity 
searches 
in 
PubMed. 
In this work, we mine synonymous patterns in 
user 
queries 
instead 
of 
scholarly 
publications 
because 
queries 
are 
generally 
short 
(Islamaj 
Dogan et al., 2009; Wilkinson et al., 1995) and 
tend to bond entities in proximity. Here we spe-
cifically target chemical-chemical and chemical-
disease 
relations 
such 
as 
chemical-induced-
disease relation (Wei et al., 2016). The proposed 
framework, however, is easily generalizable to 
understand other bio-entity relations such as pro-
tein-protein 
interaction 
(Phizicky 
and 
Fields, 
1995). 
Our work is unique in several aspects. First, 
PubMed 
queries 
are 
semantically 
analyzed 
through context patterns, and synonymous rela-
tions or synonymous context patterns are discov-
ered automatically. Second, synonymous patterns 
are applied to expand entity searches at pattern 
level to improve recall of relevant documents. 
Third, synonymous patterns can also be applied 
106
to searches with entities only, where we add ad-
ditional constraints to improve precision. Overall 
evaluation is able to point key directions for fu-
ture development and improvement of PubMed, 
and can also shed light on how to effectively 
search biomedical literature beyond PubMed.

Related Work 
Query Expansion (QE) has been an area of active 
research in Information Retrieval (IR). QE tech-
niques manage to alleviate vocabulary mismatch 
between query and document words by adding 
related words to the initial queries, with the goal 
of improving retrieval effectiveness. Below we 
discuss three types of QE techniques classified 
based on how they derive related words: ontolo-
gy-oriented, query-independent data-driven, and 
query-dependent data-driven technique. 
Ontology-oriented 
techniques 
leverage 
lan-
guage properties (e.g. synonyms, hypernyms and 
etc.) in dictionaries (Liddy and Myaeng, 1993), 
thesauri, or lexical databases (Voorhees, 1994) to 
find QE. General-purpose lexical database e.g. 
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or a domain-specific 
one e.g. MeSH (Nelson et al., 2001) may be 
used. 
Query-independent 
data-driven 
QE 
methods 
identify 
queries’ 
similar 
words 
by 
analyzing 
global-wide documents not specific to queries. 
Hence, they are also known as global corpus-
specific QE methods (Carpineto and Romano, 
2012). They learn word association by concept 
terms 
(Qiu 
and 
Frei, 
1993), 
term 
clustering 
(Crouch and Yang, 1992), distributional similari-
ty (Lin 1998; Turney 2001; Chen et al., 2006), 
semantic 
topics 
(Park 
and 
Pamamohanarao, 
2007), to name a few. 
Query-dependent 
data-driven 
techniques, 
on 
the other hand, analyze query-specific documents 
for QE. While relevance feedback uses relevant 
documents 
from 
the 
initial 
queries, 
pseudo-
relevance feedback uses top-ranked documents 
without 
human 
intervention 
(Xu 
and 
Croft, 
1996). Measures for finding related terms in ini-
tially 
returned 
documents 
include 
Rocchio’s 
weighting 
(Rocchio, 
1971), 
Chi-square 
(Doszkocs, 1978), and Kullback-Leibler distance 
(Carpineto 
et 
al., 
2001). 
Recently, 
Cui 
et 
al. 
(2003) and Riezler et al. (2007) consider user-
clicked documents relevant for QE. 
In biomedicine, QE studies primarily focus on 
ontologies and pseudo-relevance feedback. For 
example, Jalali and Borujerdi (2008) and Lu et 
al. (2009) expand queries via MeSH ontology, 
and Srinivasan (1996), Aronson (1996), and Zhu 
et al. (2006) expand queries via Unified Medical 
Language System (Lindberg et al., 1993). On the 
other hand, biomedical queries can be reformu-
lated (Lu et al., 2009) or systematically expanded 
based on initially retrieved documents focusing 
on abbreviations (Bacchin and Melucci, 2005), 
the controlled vocabulary of MeSH (Thesprasith 
and Jaruskulchai, 2014), or open vocabulary (Ri-
vas et al., 2014). 
In contrast to previous work, we semantically 
analyze 
frequently-sought 
general 
patterns 
(or 
relations) in biomedical queries, discover pattern 
synonyms, 
and 
use 
these 
automatically-learnt 
synonymous patterns to expand real-world entity 
searches in PubMed. Such general-phrase pat-
tern-level semantics understanding, complemen-
tary to domain-specific MeSH, later proves use-
ful in QE and beneficial to PubMed literature 
search in our case studies.

mous patterns or entity relations in user queries 
(Section 3.1) and exploit them in the following 
two use scenarios to improve PubMed retrieval 
effectiveness. 
Scenario 1.
Consider an entity pair search with 
explicit relation mention (e.g. comparison rela-
tion between two drugs as in 
albuterol vs levalbut-
erol
). We expand the query with its synonymous 
counterparts belonging to the same pattern-level 
relation 
(e.g. 
adding 
albuterol 
versus 
levalbuterol
, 
comparison between
albuterol and levalbuterol
, and etc.). 
With such query expansion, we expect to retrieve

formulations 
with 
identical semantics meaning.
Scenario 2
.
Consider a pure entity pair search 
without any explicit mention of entity relation 
(e.g. 
midazolam sevoflurane
). We constrain the query 
on its known search semantics learned based on 
past PubMed searches (e.g. comparison relation 
between these two drugs). The newly constructed 
search (e.g. 
midazolam vs sevoflurane
OR 
midazolam 
versus sevoflurane 
OR
…
where OR combines Pub-
Med results) is expected to direct PubMed to-
wards documents users truly interested in but 
otherwise might be ranked low based on the orig-
inal 
search. 
Take Table 
1 
for 
example. 
Top-
ranked documents are more relevant with the 
new semantics-constrained query if users are to 
compare the two entities without explicitly men-
tioning so in the search query. 
Note that in 
Scenario 1
and 
Scenario 2
we per-
form PubMed searches under relevance sorting 
(as opposed to the default chronical sorting) and 
we search PubMed and use matches in article 
titles as a proxy for human relevance evaluation 
(Kim et al., 2016). In other words, to ensure 
quick turnaround and large-scale evaluation, we 
assume those matching titles all satisfy users’ 
information 
needs 
(i.e. 
perfect 
precision) 
and 
thus no human relevance judgments is required. 
3.1
Discovering Synonymous Patterns 
We have previously developed an unsupervised 
approach for identifying synonymous patterns of 
entity relations in PubMed queries (Huang and 
Lu, 
2016). 
Due 
to 
space 
limitation, 
we 
only 
briefly outline major steps below. We refer inter-
ested readers to (Huang and Lu, 2016) for de-
tails. 
First, a six-month worth of PubMed queries 
(35M queries) are stemmed and tagged using 
entity 
recognition 
tools 
(Wei 
et 
al.,

Leaman et al., 2013; Leaman et al., 2015) for 
genes/proteins, diseases, and chemicals/drugs. 
Next, we formulate queries to context patterns 
and focus on specifically discovering synony-
mous patterns for chemical-chemical (
CC
) and 
chemical-disease 
(
CD
) 
relations. 
For 
instance, 
the query 
skin necrosis associate with warfarin
is for-
mulated into 
#D associate with #C
where 
#C
and 
#D
stands for chemical and disease entity respective-
ly. 
Inspired 
by 
distributional 
similarity 
(Lin 
1998), we then exploit these patterns’ participat-
ing entity pairs to understand their semantics. In 
such a way, synonymous patterns can be found 
in an unsupervised fashion in contrast to seeds-
required pattern recognition work (e.g. Xu and 
Wang, 2014). Take Figure 1 for example. Our 
framework will consider the pattern 
#C induce #D
semantically closer to 
#D due to #C
than to 
#C in #D 
treatment
since 
#C induce #D
and 
#D due to #C
share 
more 
participating 
entities 
in 
user 
queries: 
2 
overlapping entities out of 7 entities vs 0 out of 
7. 
To avoid data sparseness issue on (distribu-
tional similarity in) entity mention, we further 
leverage latent semantic analysis, LSA, (Rehurek 
and Sojka, 2010) to find entities’ LSA topics 
which in turn reduces the space of semantics 
analysis from the dimension of entity pairs to a 
much 
smaller 
dimension 
of 
LSA 
topics. 
The 
benefit of using LSA topics is clear: after LSA 
transformation, 
#C induce #D
in Figure 1, where 
circle’s colors depict LSA topics, shows stronger 
semantics connection with 
#D due to #C
than pre-
viously without LSA: 2 overlapping LSA topics 
out of 3 topics. 
Our LSA-based approach is able to achieve 
satisfying performance in finding semantically 
similar patterns across entity relations of interest, 
such as drug-induced-disease relation, drug-drug 
interaction, to name a few. We refer interested 
readers to (Huang and Lu, 2016) for detailed 
evaluation results. 
3.2
Expanding Entity-Relation Searches 
Once our method identifies candidates of pattern 
synonyms, we collect the set of true synonymous 
patterns and apply them to semantic query ex-
pansion as below. 
We first order a semantic relation’s synony-
mous patterns according to their frequencies in 
PubMed queries, which represent user prefer-
ences or user intuitions (in searching the target 
bio-relation between two entities). See patterns 
in descending order of frequency in the second 
and fifth column of Table 2. For example, Pub-
Med users prefer using 
#C versus #C
to 
#C vs #C
or 
comparison of #C and #C
in comparing two drugs. 
Currently, four common entity relations between 
drugs and between drugs and diseases are of our 
particular interest: drug comparison, drug com-
bination, drug-induced-disease and drug-treats-
disease. 
Second, for each relation, we assemble its 500 
most searched entity pairs from our search logs. 
For example, 
<albuterol, levalbuterol>
is a popular 
chemical pair for the drug comparison relation. 
For each entity pair (e.g. 
<albuterol, levalbuterol>
) 
of a semantic relation, we then submit a query 
with the pair using one of the relational patterns 
(e.g. 
albuterol 
vs 
levalbuterol
) 
and 
compare 
the 
search result with that of semantically expanded 
query 
that 
leverages 
all 
synonymous 
patterns 
(e.g. 
albuterol versus levalbuterol 
OR 
albuterol vs leval-
buterol 
OR … 
Syntax OR combines PubMed re-
trieval results). Recall that the searches are lim-
ited to PubMed titles. Finally, we compute the 
ratio of the number of total search results via all 
patterns of the semantic relation over that of each 
individual 
pattern, 
averaged 
over 
500 
entity 
pairs. Such difference in recall is referred to as 
benefit in recall, 
BiR
. 
As Table 2 shows, a 
BiR 
score above 1 means 
expanding queries using collective synonymous 
patterns of the same semantics improves PubMed 
recall or helps PubMed retrieve more relevant 
documents. Take the drug comparison relation 
for example. Regardless of the chemical pair of 
interest, expanded queries can always retrieve 
more relevant documents than using the individ-
ual pattern of 
#C versus #C
(more than twice as 
many on average: 2.38). In some cases of Table 
2, the improvement in recall is substantial (e.g. 
135.65 associated with 
#C compare #C
, 904.2 asso-
ciated with 
combine #C and #C
, and so on). 
The benefit of using our synonymous patterns 
for query expansion in current PubMed settings 
can be observed across various types of 
CC
or 
CD
entity-relation searches, searches with ex-
plicit 
relation 
mention. 
And 
interestingly, 
the 
most frequently used patterns by users (or the 
most 
intuitive/straightforward 
search 
patterns 
from users’ points of view) may not always be 
the best choice at default: among the drug com-
parison patterns, 
comparison of #C and #C
is more 
effective than the most popular 
#C versus #C
in 
retrieving 
relevant 
documents. 
A 
semantic 
framework like ours can balance PubMed re-
trieval results across different entity-relation ex-
pressions in searches with similar meanings. 
109
3.3
Expanding Pure Entity Pair Searches 
Among 
PubMed 
searches, 
pure 
entity 
pair 
searches or searches containing only two bio-
entities without any explicit relation mentions 
(e.g. 
midazolam sevoflurane
), account for approxi-
mately half of the searches involving dual bio-
entities. As a result, we investigate in this sub-
section how we can improve PubMed user expe-
rience by expanding these queries, with the help 
of 
our 
synonymous 
patterns 
and 
past 
user 
searches. The process is detailed below. 
First, we identify pure entity pair searches on-
ly sought by PubMed users in 
a
specific
rela-
tion/context, 
based 
on 
which 
we 
expand 
the 
searches and impose semantic search constraints. 
Take the pure entity pair search 
midazolam sevoflu-
rane
for instance. Since it had only been searched 
with drug comparison relation by PubMed users, 
we later explicitly constrain that search query in 
the context of drug comparison relation. This 
step infers the implicit relation between the enti-
ty pair from the wisdom of the crowd (i.e. past 
search logs). Our hypothesis is that such implicit 
relation, if explicitly added to the search, may 
improve retrieval results and in turn user experi-
ence. 
In the current experiment, a total of 1,600 
unique pure entity-pair queries are collected with 
CC
relation constraints (i.e. drug comparison, 
drug combination, and drug interaction) and 
CD
relation constrains (i.e. drug-treats-disease, drug-
induced-disease, 
supplement-for-disease, 
drug-
resistance-in-disease). 
Similar to the settings in Section 3.2, we sub-
mit to PubMed (a) original queries, i.e. pure enti-
ty pairs and (b) expanded queries with explicit 
relation constraints learnt from past user queries. 
For example, original search 
midazolam sevoflurane
and its semantics-constrained counterpart 
midazo-
lam versus sevoflurane 
OR
midazolam vs sevoflurane 
OR 
…
(expanded using our synonymous patterns of 
the drug comparison relation, in which 
midazolam 
sevoflurane
had only been sought) will be submit-
ted to PubMed. 
Finally, based on the search results from (a) 
and (b), we compute the retrieval effectiveness of 
regular PubMed by using (b)’s results as the 
ground truth. In other words, we assume the ex-
panded queries truly represent users’ search in-
tention and their search results truly satisfy us-
ers’ information needs. Retrieval performance is 
measured by standard information retrieval (IR) 
measures: precision (P), mean reciprocal rank 
(MRR) 
and 
nDCG 
(Jarvelin 
and 
Kekalainen, 
2002) at rank 20. 
As we can see in Table 3, the difference be-
tween current performance scores in MRR or 
nDCG and perfect scores (i.e. perfect MRR or 
nDCG 
equals 
1) 
suggests 
genuinely 
there 
is 
room for performance increase in retrieval for 
such searches, i.e. pure entity pair searches, in 
current PubMed settings. While pure 
CD
search-
es yield better results than pure 
CC
searches, po-
tential gain in performance is still substantial for 
CD
queries, which can be achieved by simply 
adding semantics constraints and expanding que-
ries accordingly. In some cases (e.g. pure entity 
pair searches with implicit drug interaction rela-
tion), 
semantics 
constraints 
almost 
warrant 
a 
more satisfying search performance.

Summary 
We have applied query semantics understanding 
to 
PubMed 
literature 
search. 
The 
proposed 
framework 
involves 
discovering 
synonymous 
relational patterns in queries and, based on those, 
expanding PubMed user queries, specifically en-
tity search queries. Preliminary evaluation shows 
such semantic query expansion helps to improve 
PubMed 
retrieval 
effectiveness. 
And 
better 
PubMed performance implies better user experi-
ence and less curation effort (Lu and Hirschman, 
2012). Incorporating such general-phrase seman-
tics 
framework, 
complementary 
to 
domain-
specific MeSH, into PubMed serving millions of 
users is warranted.
