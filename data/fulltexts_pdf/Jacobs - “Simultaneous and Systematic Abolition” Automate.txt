“Simultaneous and Systematic Abolition”?:
Automated
Content Analysis and the 1789 Cahiers de Doléances

Abstract
Upon reading a selection of the grievance books (“cahiers de doléances”) proffered
to King Louis XVI in 1789 by the various regions and estates of
France,
Alexis de
Tocqueville reflected with horror that “what they were asking for was the simultaneous
and systematic abolition of all the laws and customs in force throughout the country”
(Tocqueville 1856,
131–132).
Given that he couldn’t read all
60,000 books,
however,
to what extent is Tocqueville’s conclusion simply the result of a selection bias?
Shapiro and Markoff (1998), the culmination of decades of work manually tagging
a subset of these grievance books,
was the first step towards an answer to this ques-
tion.
After centuries of interpretive studies, Shapiro and Markoff were able to subject
hypotheses concerning the contents, geographic distribution, and socioeconomic covari-
ates of
the cahiers to rigorous statistical
testing.
Not only did their study overturn
accepted knowledge from the outset (e.g., Tocqueville’s assertion that “all of the cahiers
demand[ed]
that corvees be definitively abolished” when in fact only 13% did so),
it
also provided an extraordinarily rich dataset of tags with sufficient generality to allow
future researchers to test a range of intuitions regarding the French Revolution.
In this paper, I take quantitative studies of the French Revolution and the cahiers
de doléances one step further, by developing a fully-automated (“unsupervised”) con-
tent analysis algorithm based on computational topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
By eliminating the need for manual labeling, the paper serves as a case study demon-
strating the feasibility of obtaining insights in mere minutes which previously required
decades of work by a team of research assistants.
I show that it is possible to obtain
substantive findings regarding the relative concerns of the Nobility, Clergy, and Third
Estate using this algorithm, by illustrating the striking degree to which the results of
the model
comport with both Tocqueville’s and Shapiro and Markoff’s comparative
analyses of the cahiers.
I then use peasant revolt data from Markoff (1996) to explore
the relationship between emphasis on the automatically-discovered “seigneurial rights”
grievance topic and variation in “anti-seignurial
events” among the peasantry.
I con-
clude with a proposal
for a “supervised” learning approach which allows researchers
full control over the learned grievance categories via a small set of manually-produced
“seed” tags.

It’s all in the cahiers.

Introduction
With the summoning of
the Estates-General
in 1789 by King Louis XVI,
requesting “a
concourse of
our faithful
subjects,
to assist us in surmounting all
the difficulties we find
relative to the state of
our finances”,
the drafting of
the cahiers de doléances (“grievance
books”) began,
inaugurating a self-reflective prelude to the revolution that would change
the course of history perhaps more than any event before or since.
In preparation for the
May 1789 meeting,
the Clergy,
Nobility,
and Third Estate of
each bailliage of
France was
asked to assemble and to compile a list of
their grievances regarding the social,
political,
and economic practices of the ancien régime.
Because of this remarkable process, the French
Revolution of 1789 stands out as “the only major revolution at the beginning of which so
much of
the nation gathered in public assemblies and recorded its grievances,
aspirations,
and demands for change” (Markoff 1996, 21).
Jean Jules Jusserand, French historian and ambassador to the US, once besought a young
student of the French Revolution:
“Read the cahiers.
It’s all in the cahiers” (Andrews 1935,
212).
Upon reading a selection of the cahiers, Alexis de Tocqueville was stunned:
When I came to the end of this vast collection of texts and put all these specific
requests together,
I was horrified to realize that what they were asking for was
the simultaneous and systematic abolition of all
the laws and customs in force
throughout the country.
I saw at once that this would lead to one of the most
extensive and dangerous revolutions that had ever occurred anywhere in the
world.
(de Tocqueville 1856, 131–132)
2
Indeed,
it is difficult to avoid reading the cahiers dispassionately,
knowing that they
represent the hopes and fears of a population standing on the precipice of a revolution which
would, in Mallet du Pan’s unforgettable phrase, “devour its children”.
Tocqueville described
it as “a phenomenon so new and so different from anything that had ever happened before, yet
so monstrous and incomprehensible, that the human mind could not grasp it” (de Tocqueville
1856, 13).
With an event so laden with meaning for so many, and so central to the identity
of
France and “the West” to this day
1
interpreters of
the Revolution like Tocqueville are
bound to bring their own biases to the table when studying its annals.
It is with this inevitable affective bias in mind that I develop and conduct the automated
content analysis herein.
Although human biases are embedded in each step of
any given
computer algorithm,
I contend that the logic behind the trajectory of internal
states in an
algorithm is significantly more transparent and amenable to error analysis than the internal
states of the human mind.
Hence, as is emphasized throughout Markoff and Shapiro (1998),
automation of
a subtask in a content analysis allows the parameters of
that subtask to
be adjusted rapidly and continuously (in contrast to manual content analyses,
where small
changes can entail months of recoding), thus allowing the researcher to encode, observe, and
explore the effects of a particular bias and “fine-tune” these parameters with an aim towards
counterbalancing their own biases.
To this end,
I
have made all
code,
data,
and other
replication materials available on GitHub
2
to enable future researchers to explore different
parameter settings and encodings of bias from those constituting this work.
In the next section I review prior work on both the cahiers and computational-linguistically-
informed automated content analysis, before moving into a description of the data and pre-
processing procedures in Section 3.1.
Section 3 describes and presents findings from my
1
As Timothy Tackett puts it in his introduction to Lefebvre’s Coming of
the French Revolution,
“an
understanding of
the Revolution and its origins was linked to the very concept of
national
identity” in
France, compelling French statesmen to return to the Revolution time and time again for lessons bearing on
contemporary issues (Tackett 2004, viii).

first study of the contents of cahiers, an unsupervised topic model revealing differences be-
tween the estates with respect to automatically-discovered topics latent within the cahiers.
In Section 4 I describe a second “supervised” study of
the cahiers in two stages.
First,
after explaining the data processing and manual tagging required as inputs, I describe how
to measure how “well-calibrated” the results of
the model
are to the results of
a manual
content analysis (described here with in Shapiro and Markoff 1998 as the example).
I then
explain how to generate a plot illustrating how these results change as the number of training
samples decreases,
thus providing what is essentially a power analysis,
indicating how few
training samples a researcher would need to obtain to get within a desired margin of error
α
of the “true” results obtained via manual content analysis.
Section 5 concludes, outlining a
series of datasets from manual content analyses which would allow for additional calibration
as well as text corpora which are particularly suitable for analysis via the methods developed
herein.

Prior Work
2.1
Qualitative Studies of the Cahiers
Almost from their advent, the cahiers were subjected to a radical variety of interpretations.
Perhaps the most well-known of these is the interpretation given by Alexis de Tocqueville in
his 1856 The Old Regime and the Revolution.
Tucked away in a footnote to Book II entitled
“Analysis of
the Grievance Books of
the Nobility in 1789”,
Tocqueville paints a picture
of
the cahiers of
the Nobility as illustrating a radical
spirit desirous of
sweeping changes
across all
aspects of
social,
political,
and economic life.
“In short,” he intones,
“reading
the grievance books of
the nobles leads to the conclusion that they might have made the
Revolution themselves had they only been commoners, for that was the only ingredient they
lacked” (de Tocqueville 1856,
244).
Recognizing that the validity of these conclusions rest
4
upon the validity of
the cahiers themselves as representative of
the true feelings of
their
drafters,
Tocqueville insists that they were “drafted in complete freedom,
in very public
circumstances,
by each of the orders.
They were discussed at length among the interested
parties and earnestly reflected upon by their drafters, for when government appealed to the
nation in those days,
it did not take it upon itself to supply both questions and answers”
(de Tocqueville 1856, 234).
Francois Furet, however, expresses a common skepticism of the cahiers when he charac-
terizes them as “difficult to interpret and probably misleading:
under the umbrella of the
people as a whole, it was really the lawyers who were expressing themselves; they had most
often presided over the assemblies and drawn up the grievances” (Furet 1988,
58).
And
indeed,
most scholars agree that “model” cahiers (containing pre-selected grievances) were
often adopted without modification by local assemblies.
Georges Lefebvre,
however,
points
out that a not-insignificant number of the cahiers (at both the general and the parish level)
eschew the models altogether,
or modify and combine them to suit their purposes:
“In the
bailiwick of
Nancy,
for example,
the use of
eleven different models has been proved:
33
parishes adopted one model or another, 12 combined two or more, 32 either saw no models
or declined to use them.
In the bailiwick of
Arques only a quarter of
the lists were influ-
enced by models” (Lefebvre 1947, 69).
Thus, for the sake of this work, I share Tocqueville’s
fascination with the cahiers as a unique documentary record from “the only [revolution] at
the beginning of which the different classes of society were enabled to present an authentic
account of
the ideas they had conceived,
and express the feelings which animated them,
before the revolution had distorted or modified those ideas and feelings” (Tocqueville 1856,
262).

2.2
Quantitative Studies of the Cahiers
In the 20th century, two landmark studies of the cahiers shifted the focus of this scholarship
away from interpretive studies of
haphazardly-selected subsets of
the cahiers and towards
statistically-principled large-
N
analysis.
With the archival and methodological developments
made by these studies,
historians of
the French Revolution could for the first time test
hypotheses and make well-founded inferences about the contents of the cahiers, in Popperian
fashion.
Beatrice Hyslop, in a series of three works between 1933 and 1936 (Hyslop 1933, Hyslop
1934, Hyslop 1936), set the standard upon which all subsequent quantitative studies of the
cahiers have been built.
As part of
her doctoral
work at Columbia University,
she was
commissioned by the French government’s Commission d’Histoire Économique et Sociale de
la Révolution Française to collect and catalogue the contents and details (publication dates,
aberrations in the drafting,
mistakes and omissions in the existing volumes) of the cahiers
in one place, a task which led to her 1933 PhD dissertation, titled “Répertoire Critique des
Cahiers de Doléances pour les Etats-Généreaux de 1789”.
With this rich set of
cahiers and associated information,
Hyslop performed a content
analysis of nationalistic sentiment in the cahiers which for the first time was able to draw
conclusions regarding the entirety of
French society – all
three estates and (nearly) every
bailliage in every region of the country – utilizing both the general cahiers and a wide swath
of the parish-level
cahiers which reflected more directly the opinions of the rural
peasants.
This work was published in 1934 as French Nationalism in 1789 According to the General
Cahiers, and remains a cornerstone of French Revolution scholarship.
Most important to the present study,
however,
is Hyslop’s 1936 Guide to the General
Cahiers of
1789.
This work,
essentially synthesizing the lessons learned from her doctoral
work and from the issues she encountered while performing the content analysis of French
nationalism,
acknowledged the fact that the scope of subsequent work would be limited if
6
researchers could only study the cahiers via her particular coding scheme (a fairly coarse set
of codes indicating whether a particular grievance voiced nationalistic sentiment).
Hence, in
this work she translated (and updated) the findings from her 1933 cataloguing of the cahiers
into English,
provided a set of
data tables listing sources,
dates,
corrections,
and cross-
references for each bailliage
3
,
and included an appendix with hundreds of pages of cahiers
which had previously been spread across dozens of out-of-print or hard-to-find sources.
With
this volume, researchers could develop their own coding schemes relative to a shared “base”
dataset of
cahiers,
adapted to whatever hypotheses and aspects of
1789 France they were
interested in studying.
Gilbert Shapiro and John Markoff’s 1998 Revolutionary Demands,
the culmination of
decades of
work manually tagging and analyzing the cahiers,
represents the state-of-the-
art in quantitative (though non-automated) content analysis.
Taking seriously Hyslop’s
point that a coding scheme developed with a particular hypothesis in mind precludes other
researchers from studying different hypotheses without re-doing the entire tagging process,
Shapiro and Markoff explicitly aimed to make their coding scheme as general
as possible.
Central
to this aim was their insistence on separating the researchers from the coders as
much as possible.
The coders in their study were purposefully kept entirely in the dark as
to the hypotheses of the study, thus ensuring that the particular hypotheses and analytical
categories of interest to the researchers would not impact the coding, allowing the codes to
be used as-is by other researchers studying vastly different hypotheses.
One way Shapiro and Markoff ensured maximum reusability was by utilizing a hierarchical
coding scheme,
with very general
characteristics of
the grievances being recorded at the
top of
the hierarchy (See Columns 1 and 2 of
Table 5 for a list of
these top-level
codes),
and specific characteristics (e.g., the mention of particular taxes or judicial institutions) at
the lower levels.
In addition,
their scheme separates the subject
of the grievances from the
3

7
particular actions demanded regarding these subjects, by having two separate sets of “Subject
Codes” and “Action Codes”, with the latter further subdivided into “General Action Codes”
applicable across all subjects (e.g., abolition, reform, more/less bureaucratic oversight) and
“Special Action Codes” which apply only to particular subjects (e.g., “That the Third Estate
be permitted access to posts and careers in the church”, which applies only to subjects within
the “Religion” category.
For a list of the top 10 Special Action Codes, see Column 5 of Table
4).
As yet another step in the direction of
reproducible and transparent scientific study
of
the French Revolution,
Shapiro and Markoff created a computer program,
the French
Revolution Analysis System, allowing researchers to explore and perform tests on the cahiers
via boolean queries (e.g.,
“(Grievance concerns the corvées) OR (Grievance concerns the
tail le)”).
Although the program is no longer compatible with modern operating systems
(tested on Windows 10,
Mac OSX,
and Ubuntu Linux 16.02),
I was able to run it on a
Virtual Machine running Windows 95 and export the list of tags en masse for each category,
data which I have made available on the project’s GitHub repository.
It is with the data
made available via Shapiro and Markoff’s tables in combination with the tags exported from
this program that I was able to utilize Natural
Language Processing techniques,
discussed
in the next section.
2.3
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
With the advent of
computers and the ability to store and process massive corpora auto-
matically, the computer science subfield of “Natural Language Processing” began to develop
algorithms for efficiently parsing,
clustering,
and performing syntactic and semantic analy-
ses of natural text.
Topic Modeling (Blei et al.
2003) is an unsupervised Natural Language
Processing technique which aims to discover distinct “topics” within the corpus and classify
each portion of the text (in the case of the present work, individual grievances) by how well
8
Figure 1:
Results of a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model run on the New York
Times corpus with the number-of-topics parameter
K
= 10.
Figure from Blei (2012).
it seems to correspond to these topics.
For example,
a topic model
run on the New York
Times corpus (Figure 1) effectively “recovers” the sections of the newspaper (e.g., Finance,
Sports,
Food) based solely on the textual contents of individual articles,
without any prior
knowledge of these sections or “steering” by the researcher.
Though the constituent technologies (topic models, linguistic parsing algorithms, super-
vised machine learning algorithms) have been available since the late 1980s, the utilization of
natural language processing methods for social-scientific content analyses did not begin until
2009,
with Stewart and Zhukov’s automated content analysis of speeches by Russian polit-
ical elites between 1998 and 2008 (Stewart and Zhukov 2009) and Gentzkow and Shapiro’s
analysis of
news articles published in 2005 across 433 newspapers (Gentzkow and Shapiro
2010).
Jensen et al.
(2012) incorporate a time-series element, analyzing changes in linguistic
polarization in the Congressional Record between 1873 and 2009.
Perhaps most relevant for our present study is a forthcoming study (Blaydes et al.
2018)
which uses Topic Modeling to analyze the different focuses that Christian and Muslim writers
9
gave to different topics when writing “mirrors for princes”, essentially guidebooks for rulers
with advice on how to rule effectively.
In this study,
46 texts (21 from the “Islamic tradi-
tion” and 25 from Christian Europe) in English translation are analyzed using a Bayesian
Hierarchical Topic Modeling algorithm (Grimmer 2010), and results are compared between
the Islamic and Christian texts.
After examining the most-indicative words within each topic (the hierarchical structure
allows them to estimate 4 broad topics, each of which contains 15 more specific sub-topics),
they label
the topics as “The Art of Rulership” (Topic 1),
“Personal
Virtues,
Habits,
and
Relationships” (Topic 2), “Religion and Faith” (Topic 3), and “Political Geography and the
Natural World” (Topic 4).
With these labels, they are able to analyze the relative proportions
of
the texts which focus on these different areas,
and compare these proportions between
the Christian and Islamic texts.
Using this approach,
they find for example that while the
two traditions place a similar amount of emphasis on Topics 2 and 3 overall,
the Christian
tradition places significantly more emphasis on “Political Geography and the Natural World”,
while the Islamic tradition places more emphasis on “Political
Geography and the Natural
World”.
In addition to this “cross-sectional” analysis,
they perform a time-series analysis,
ana-
lyzing changes in these topic-emphasis proportions over time and relating them to historical
events.
For example,
they find that the Medieval
Islamic canon exhibits a rapid increase
in focus on the “Religion and Faith” topic,
occurring at the same time as a rapid increase
in Turkic incursions into and conquests of
Muslim cities and villages noted by historians.
Delving deeper into this period, they find that the historical literature describes this era as
one in which
Turkic rulers,
like the Seljuks,
sought to legitimize their political
authority by
presenting themselves as defenders of the faith, even waging “jihad against non-
Muslim populations in Anatolia and Central Asia” (Blaydes et al.
2016, quoting
10
Lapidus 1996, 13).
Thus we see an example of the potentially fruitful role that automated content analysis can
play in historiographic practice:
the historical claim (“Turkic rulers
. . .
sought to legitimize”)
can be substantiated or belied to some degree by analyzing machine-learned patterns within
the text of
a corpus.
Though my present study concerns a cross-sectional
corpus (i.e.,
I
don’t have series of “developing” cahiers over time),
one could easily imagine time-varying
extensions to the project (perhaps utilizing the entirety of the Archives Parlementaires with
the associated dates for each text), some of which I describe in Section 5.
3
Exploratory (Unsupervised) Analysis
3.1
Obtaining and Cleaning the Data
English translations of the cahiers are few and far between
4
.
A rich corpus of the full French
text of
nearly all
cahiers known to exist,
however,
has been meticulously pieced together
via the combined efforts of hundreds of researchers.
For the purposes of this work I utilize
the most complete and up-to-date list of cahiers and their sources available at the time of
writing, that given in Appendix III of Shapiro and Markoff (1998)
5
As a first step, I translate between the entries in the cahier list and the actual locations
in the sources.
For the Archives Parlementaires, Shapiro and Markoff employ a standardized
index providing the start and end locations plus an indicator character ‘A’ or ‘B’ denoting
whether the cahier begins on the left (‘A’) or right (‘B’) side of the page.
To operationalize
this index, I (a) obtained the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML-formatted versions of the
Archives’ first six volumes, (b) employed Regular Expressions
6
in Python to obtain a volume
4
In my research we were able to locate 26 English translations scattered across 5 different works,
a
miniscule proportion of the approximately 60,000 total cahiers.
5
I have digitized and reproduced this table in Appendix C herein.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression
11
number and page range for each cahier,
and then (c) extracted each individual
cahier via
Regular Expressions run on the XML from (a)
7
.
To ensure that no portions of the cahiers
were lost,
the indicator characters were ignored and any text appearing before or after the
cahier of interest was filtered out later on in the pipeline.
Of the 357 general cahiers from the Archives Parlementaires listed in the table, I exclude
9 joint cahiers of the three estates and 5 cahiers of cities (Lyon,
Metz,
Rouen,
Strasbourg,
and Valenciennes),
leaving me with 158 Noble cahiers and 185 Third Estate cahiers.
In
the next stage, the cahiers are further divided into individual grievances.
I again employed
Regular Expressions to detect the beginning and end of each grievance, checking for example
if and where the string
"Art. "
followed by a numeral appears in the document
8
.
3.2
Model and Estimation
For my first analysis I minimize the imposition of
particular hypotheses on the corpus by
utilizing an unsupervised topic modeling approach.
Following a similar procedure to that
employed in Blaydes et al.
(2018), I fit a Bayesian hierarchical topic model (Grimmer 2010)
with the aim of
comparing the top words in each topic across estates (Nobility vs.
Third
Estate), to gain insight on what aspects of each topic differ between the three estates (e.g.,
whether an estate focuses more on bureaucratically- or constitutionally-oriented grievances
regarding the legal system).
Even a “null” result such as there being no significant differences
between the Nobility and Third Estate cahiers would be interesting here,
in that it would
provide additional support for Tocqueville’s interpretation of the nobles as being essentially
equal in radicalism to the Third Estate.
7
Using Regular Expressions for XML parsing is typically frowned upon,
as XML is a Chomsky Type 2
(Context-Free) language while Regular Expressions are Chomsky Type 3 (Regular).
Unfortunately, however,
the TEI
XML files provided by the French Revolution Digital
Archive are not valid XML,
so Regular
Expressions are required in this case, an issue researchers working with the files should take note of.
8
This subtask could be automated (with improved performance) via a simple supervised machine learning
approach, which I leave for future exploration.
12
The model
is based on the following data-generating process (Grimmer 2010):
Con-
sider a “nationwide” Dirichlet distribution
α
, a prior distribution over distributions of topic
importances which puts more weight on more likely distributions and,
importantly,
allows
information sharing between the otherwise-independent bailliage
×
estate pairs.
Then each
bailliage-estate
b
draws a particular distribution of topic importances
π
b
= (
π
b
1
, π
b
2
, . . . , π
bK
)
over
K
topics from this
α
9
and produces a set of
N
b
grievance topics
T
b
=
{t
b
1
, t
b
2
, . . . , t
bN
b
}
,
where each
t
bi
is independently drawn from this topic importance distribution
π
b
.
Finally,
the actual
observed text of each grievance
g
b
1
, g
b
2
, . . . , g
bN
b
is drawn from the set of topics
T
b
via a von Mises-Fisher distribution,
chosen due to its agnosticism to the length of
the
observed documents, a property lacking in the case of the Normal distribution (Banerjee et
al.
2005).
The advantages of this model over a non-hierarchical topic model are numerous,
but in
particular the explicit modeling of
bailliage-estate ideology via the
π
b
distributions allows
me to get an indication of
the idiosyncrasies of
each bailliage-estate.
If
one of
the topics
i
corresponds to “radicalism” in some sense,
for example,
then a bailliage-estate (say,
the
Third Estate of Grenoble) with a high density on
i
can be interpreted as one with a high
degree of “radicalism”.
In an extension to the model
available via the
expAgenda
package
in R, such a relationship can be further explored by including covariates like the frequency
of peasant revolts (Markoff 1990 – see analysis in Section 3.4 below), degree of urbanization
(Shapiro et al.
1973), or rate of emigration (Greer 1951) within each bailliage.
3.3
Results
First,
I present the 10 most-indicative words for each topic in Table 1.
The topic labels I
inferred from these terms are as follows:

Importantly, the Dirichlet prior ensures that
π

lives in the

Sometimes specifically corrupt dioceses or parish priests are mentioned.

Table 1:
10 Most Indicative Words for Each Topic
Next,
I plot the relative frequencies of
each topic for both the Nobility and the Third
Estate in Figure 2.
From this plot we immediately see two patterns.
First,
the small
differences between the two estates (relative to the large differences between topics) lend
credence to Tocqueville’s interpretation of
the Noble cahiers as being quite similar both
linguistically and in terms of radicalism of demands to the Third Estate.
14
Figure 2:
Relative Topic Frequencies by Estate
However, although differences between the estates with respect to Judicial and Ecclesias-
tical Reforms are not statistically significant, we do observe statistically significant differences
in emphasis between the estates with respect to Assembly Procedures and Rights.
While
the Nobility has a more “narrow” focus on assembly procedures in the immediate future
(an assembly which many Nobles will
have the chance to attend while very few members
of the Third Estate will have the same opportunity), the Third Estate is significantly more
vocal
about the seigneurial,
commerical,
and civil
freedoms which affect their day-to-day
lives at home.
Thus,
through an unsupervised “exploratory” analysis of the cahiers,
I am
able to verify Tocqueville’s assertions in broad strokes while also “zooming in” and gaining
a more nuanced understanding of the particular institutions of the ancien régime for which
15
his analysis was most and least accurate.
Strikingly,
the two topics on which the estates differ comport with the comparative
analysis in Chapter 15 of
Shapiro and Markoff (1998),
titled “Consensus and Conflict at
the Onset
of
Revolution”.
Of
the 41 subjects they analyze for
differences between the
estates in Table 15-4 (reproduced here in Table 2),
only four exhibit statistically signifi-
cant differences:
“Estates-General”, “Economy (miscellaneous)”, “Criteria of mobility”, and
“Seigneurial
regime”.
Given the strong association of
the words in Topic 1 with the pro-
cedures of
the Estates-General,
and of
the words in Topic 3 with Seigneurial
rights (with
“seigneur” being the most indicative word for this topic besides “droit”), we therefore have
a quite remarkable result:
that the two topics which significantly differed in my analysis
between the Nobility and Third Estate precisely align with two of the four manually-tagged
topics that Shapiro and Markoff’s analysis finds to have significant differences between the
estates.
It is also noteworthy that the two topics found to have non-significant in my unsuper-
vised analysis align with non-significant topics in Shapiro and Markoff’s analysis.
First,
my non-significant “Judicial Reform” topic corresponds to Shapiro and Markoff’s “Justice”
top-level code, within which none of the sub-topics are found to be significant:
“Justice (gen-
eral)”,
“Criminal
prosecution”,
“Courts”,
“Civil
law”,
“Due process”,
“Enforcement agents
of
courts”,
and “Legal
professions”.
Similarly,
my non-significant “Church Reform” topic
corresponds to Shapiro and Markoff’s top-level
“Religion” code,
within which again they
find no significant differences in any of the sub-topics:
“Religion (miscellaneous)”, “Religion
(general)”, “Church finances”, “Church-state relations”, “Tithe”, and “Morality”.

the two estates via automated text analysis already

with the theories of Tocqueville and Shapiro and Markoff described above,
the next stage
of a substantive content analysis entails explaining why these variations occur – what socio-
demographic variables are able to explain the observed differences between the Nobility and
the Third Estate cahiers?
To investigate this question,
I first decided to explore the role that radicalism of
the
peasantry – measured via the number of peasant revolts in a bailliage – had on the contents
of
the cahiers of
the Nobility and the Third Estate.
Did the Nobility or Third Estate in
bailliages with more peasant revolts pay more attention to (for example) reforms,
or to
the Rights of Man and the Citizen,
as measured through emphasis on Topics 2 and 4 and
Topic 3 in our results, respectively, out of fear that without reforms their countrysides would
explode? Or did the drafters in these more unstable bailliages under -emphasize these topics,
perhaps hoping to push instead for more “law and order” at the Estates-General
without
making concessions to the peasantry?
To answer this question, I merged my topic-emphasis data with data on the frequency of
peasant revolts between 1788 and 1793 from Markoff (1996)
10
.
Aggregate monthly counts of
these revolt events are given in Figure 3.
The results of my covariate analysis are presented in Figure 4.
As can be seen from the
plots, there is essentially no relationship between the number of peasant revolts in a bailliage
and the distribution of emphasis that the bailliage places on our four topics.
Indeed,
even
when the data is split into pre- and post-Cahier-drafting sets (thus mirroring Shapiro and
Markoff’s methodology more directly and allowing us to move a step closer towards studying
causality) I still observe no relationship, as illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.
As a final
test that most closely matches the method of
Chapter 21 in Shapiro and
10
Two of
the bailliages,
Vitry-Le-Francois and Villers-La-Montagne,
had no revolt data in the dataset
I was able to obtain.
This is most likely due to the fact that this dataset was itself
based on Optical
Character Recognition of an on-paper data table, which probably got cut off before the end, as these are the
alphabetically-last bailliages in the data.

predictor variable into a binary any-revolts variable,
regress the topic proportions on this
binary variable separately for the Third Estate and Nobility cahiers,
then compare the
regression coefficients using the method of Clogg et al.
(1995).
Results from this analysis
are presented in Table 3, and again we see a lack of any significant effect of revolts on topic
emphasis,
nor any significant difference between Nobility and Third Estate cahiers with
respect to the effect of
revolts on topic emphases.
For the latter comparison,
I used the
following equation from Clogg et al.
(1995):
z

β
N obility
− β
T E
q
SE
(
β

)

(

2
then computed the two-tailed
p
-values (since I’m testing
H

:
β
N obility
=
β
T E
) in standard
fashion as 2(1
−
Φ(
|z|
)), where Φ(
·
) is the Normal CDF. I repeated this analysis separately
for pre-drafting and post-drafting revolts with substantively similar results (available upon
request).
With these results, we can tentatively conclude that unlike the Parish cahiers, the con-
tents of which Shapiro and Markoff (1998) finds to be significantly associated with the number
and type of revolts in the parishes, the Nobility and Third Estate cahiers show no significant
association with the existence or frequency of these peasant insurrections.
In general,
be-
cause these results are conditional upon the salience of the automatically-discovered topics,
significant results may indeed obtain for a different set of
topics.
However,
based on my
earlier argument for the salience of these topics and their strong correspondence with topics
manually created in Shapiro and Markoff’s analysis, I conclude that we have again uncovered
an interesting result, this time regarding the (lack of) impact of a socio-political variable on
the contents of
the cahiers.
I also emphasize that this analysis can be repeated for other
covariates of interest to scholars of the French Revolution,
such as those mentioned above
(urbanization, population density, and rate of emigration) which are immediately obtainable
21
and which I am making available on the project’s GitHub page.

Extension:
Supervised Analysis and Calibration
Although the unsupervised model
gives us insights into the relative importance of
ancien
régime reforms among the three estates,
without any a priori
hypotheses,
this exploratory
endeavor should be coupled with content-analytic statistical
testing once hypotheses have
been generated.
Hence, in this section, I develop a supervised content analysis model which
enables accurate statistical
inference from a small
number of training examples (document
tags) regarding the characteristics of the entire corpus.
With this model,
one can quantify
exactly how the quality of inference degrades as the number of training examples gets smaller
and smaller, producing a “sample size determination curve” researchers can then use to derive
the minimal number of manual tags necessary to achieve a desired level of accuracy
12
.
4.1
Obtaining and Cleaning the Data
A supervised study of the cahiers in this mode requires both separate data (the individual
tags from Shapiro and Markoff (1998)) and a separate data-cleaning process,
as one needs
to process the cahier texts in such a way that they can unambiguously pair each tag with
a specific cahier.
As presented in the FRAS program manual, the tag data (exported from
the program as described in Section 2) contains the following information for each cahier :
•
A unique numerical grievance ID
•
The bailliage number (mapped to bailliage names via the table in Appendix B)
•
The estate (N for Nobility, T for Third Estate, P for Parishes)
•
The page number:
‘A’ or ‘B’ for the left and right sides of the page, in the case of the
Archives Parlementaires
12
The method developed in this section is being pursued for a separate forthcoming work.
23
•
Location on the page of the beginning of the discussion, measured in tenths of an inch
from the top
•
Abbreviation of the source and volume number (mapped to the full source information
via the list in Appendix D)
•
Abbreviated version of the bailliage name
•
(In the case of Parish files only) PAR XX, where XX is a serial index identifying the
particular parish that expressed the grievance.
The full names of the parishes and the
document sources are listed in Appendix C.
Computationally, since the TEI XML format does not record spatial details such as inches
from the top of the page, the start and end locations of each tagged grievance needed to be
approximated based on some combination of (a) the locations in tenths-of-an-inch given in
the tag export data,
(b) the total
number of grievances recorded as starting on each page,
and (c) the automated grievance partitions computed via Regular Expressions during the
unsupervised study.
Though a seemingly daunting task prima facie,
recent advances in Neural
Networks
(a powerful
but under-theorized machine learning framework which,
in practice,
radically
outperforms “standard” machine learning algorithms in learning complex high-dimensional
and non-linear functions
13
) allow one to model the task as an “end-to-end” learning problem,
feeding in the quantities (a), (b), and (c) and providing negative feedback when a grievance
produced by the algorithm does not match the intended grievance.
In this manner, once the
Neural Network has been sufficiently trained, retrieving the grievances for each tag becomes
a trivial problem.
13
For a clear and thorough introduction,
see Nielsen (2015),
or Goodfellow et al.
(2016) for a more in-
depth description of the topic.
For a survey of Natural Language Processing-specific applications of Neural
Networks, see Goldberg (2017).
24
The only remaining task for such an analysis would then be the following:
starting
with all
of
the (cahier,
tag) pairs,
check that the Neural
Network indeed converged by
verifying whether the resulting tag distributions match the distribution given in Table 4.
The remainder of
the procedure then entails simply removing some proportion
p
of
the
cahiers in a stepwise fashion,
having the supervised machine learning algorithm infer the
missing tags in each step.
While Support Vector Machines are the most common algorithms
for this type of classification problem, the Random Forest algorithm outperformed Support
Vector Machines in Stewart and Zhukov (2009),
thus I opt for Random Forests to perform
this inference step.
Finally,
to evaluate the performance of
the supervised algorithm as a
function of the proportion of tags removed
p
,
a simple metric such as Mean Squared Error
can be used:
MSE
(
p
) =
N
X
i∈S
(
t
i
(
R
p
)
− a
i
(
R
p
))
2
,
where
R
p
is the set of
pN
grievances removed from the
N
total
grievances,
S
is the set of
possible tag values,
t
i
(
R
p
) is the true proportion of tag
i
among the removed grievances
R
p
(i.e., the values in Table 4 scaled to only incorporate the
pN
removed grievances), and
a
i
(
R
p
)
is the proportion of tags with value
i
in the algorithm’s set of guessed tags for the grievances
in
R
p
.
With this quantity
MSE
(
p
) plotted for all
values of
p ∈
[0
,
1],
the researcher thus
obtains a curve indicating precisely the extent to which the quality of the automatic tagging
degrades as fewer and fewer training examples are supplied.
By choosing a maximum desired
error threshold, then, they can “read off” how many manual tags are necessary directly from
the plot.

Conclusion
I have developed unsupervised and supervised models for automated content analysis,
en-
abling both exploratory analyses to be conducted with no manual
tagging and hypothesis-
testing-based analyses to be conducted with a provably minimal number of manual tags.
The methods immediately suggest that fruitful
insights can be derived from corpora
too large for manual
content analyses or for which a dearth of
resources has precluded
manual
content analyses.
Bearing a somewhat striking resemblance to the cahiers,
the
letters,
speeches,
and pamphlets of the “100 Flowers Period” of Maoist China (Nieh 1981)
remain understudied.
To this end,
I have digitized and performed preliminary analyses of
these documents, with results and data available upon request.
Slightly further afield,
lyrics from the African-American musical
tradition – from 17th-
century spirituals to present-day hip hop – constitute an immeasurably rich source of senti-
ments regarding socio-political norms and institutions from a traditionally marginalized and
excluded population.
Thus I have also scraped a large corpus of more than 2 million song
lyrics from both the web and digitized songbooks (available upon request),
and I plan to
conduct an automated content analysis on this data in the near future.
The structure of this
data presents a new set of challenges but an important new dimension of analysis:
change
over time.
As each song is tagged with a date,
I can not only analyze relative sentiment
between groups (say,
regions of
the U.S.),
but also changes in sentiment across time (say,
before and after the abolition of slavery, the Civil Rights movement, or the election of Barack
Obama)
