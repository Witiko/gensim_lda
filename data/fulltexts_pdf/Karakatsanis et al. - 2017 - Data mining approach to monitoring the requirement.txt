In challenging economic times,
the ability to monitor trends and shifts in the job market would be hugely
valuable to job-seekers,
employers,
policy makers and investors.
To analyze the job market,
researchers are
increasingly turning to data science and related techniques which are able to extract underlying patterns from
large collections of data. One database which is of particular relevance in the presence context is O*NET, which
is one of the most comprehensive publicly accessible databases of occupational requirements for skills, abilities
and knowledge. However, by itself the information in O
*
NET is not enough to characterize the distribution of
occupations required in a given market or region. In this paper, we suggest a data mining based approach for
identifying the most in-demand occupations in the modern job market.
To achieve this,
a Latent Semantic
Indexing (LSI) model was developed that is capable of matching job advertisement extracted from the Web with
occupation description data in the O
*
NET database.
The ﬁndings of
this study demonstrate the general
usefulness and applicability of
the proposed method for highlighting job trends in diﬀerent industries and
geographical
areas,
identifying occupational
clusters,
studying the changes in jobs context over time and for
various other research embodiments.
1.
Introduction
1.1.
Background
Rapid
changes
in working
environments
and
newly
adopted
technologies have a profound impact on economic development [1].
While technological progress has generally augmented productivity, it
has also resulted in structural
unemployment,
inequality and social
imbalance [2].
In such uncertain economic setting standardized data
about the skills and attributes of
occupations is a valuable asset for
ﬁrms,
managers and employers to access basic information about the
requirements and needs of the job market [3].
O
*
NET is a publicly available database that has been used by many
researchers for examining the changes in occupational
skill
composi-
tion and identifying signiﬁcant skill categories. This analysis has been
proved very useful
for
understanding how the skills
and abilities
required for
each job have
been aﬀected by recent
technological
advancements changes.
Many of
these studies have been centered
around the changes in the intensive margin which focuses changes in
the composition of jobs themselves [2,4,5].
Analysis of the extensive
margin (i.e. changes in the demand and distribution of jobs) is also of
great interest to the scientiﬁc community but the format of the O
*
NET
database would be less appropriate in this case. This is because it was
designed to characterize the skills required for diﬀerent occupations
but does not actually characterize the demand or prevalence of those
jobs. For example, “Project Manager” and “Software Developer” would
both appear as a single line in the O
*
NET database and be equally
weighted, whereas companies will typically employ many more devel-
opers than project managers.
A further limitation is that O
*
NET was
developed for the US job market and might contain terms and job titles
that are US speciﬁc. This in turn limits the applicability of O
*
NET when
analyzing international job markets.
1.2.
Motivation and objectives
National
agencies publish structured data related to labor market
demand,
but these data lack suﬃcient detail or timeliness to suit our
objective. For example, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the

Occupation Employment Survey once per year and groups occupations
at a coarser level than O
*
NET. Some nations of interest do not publish
comparable statistics at all. This paper addresses detail, timeliness and
US-speciﬁcity by suggesting a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model
for matching job postings existing on the Web with occupation data in
the O
*
NET database. Speciﬁcally, we aim to detect the O
*
NET occupa-
tions with the greatest demand, identify popular job clusters and study
the changes over time in the job market. A link to the O
*
NET data like
this will allow direct comparisons to be made between various markets
consisting of jobs with diﬀerent names and roles in diﬀerent countries.
Such analysis can be of very great value to human resource managers,
organizations,
recruiting employers and job seekers trying to under-
stand the
skills
requirements
in the
modern job market
era.
In
addition,
the increasing number of
studies which speciﬁcally target
the skills content of jobs [2,5] requires a speciﬁc O
*
NET database to be
available for each country, region etc. Since this is a diﬃcult task that
has to be repeated for each country developing a method that maps
diﬀerent markets to O
*
NET could oﬀer a viable alternative.
2.
Data collection and pre-processing
2.1.
O
*
NET
O
*
NET contains
detailed information on more
than 1000 US
occupations.
Among this information the ﬁelds that
are most
com-
monly used by previous studies are those which describe the skills,
abilities and typical
work activities corresponding to each occupation
[2,5].
These ﬁelds are expressed as numerical values reﬂecting highly
trained labor experts’
assessments of the signiﬁcance of each ﬁeld to
each occupation.
However,
the
present
work
follows
a
diﬀerent
approach by utilizing textual information of ﬁelds describing the tasks,
duties and requirements associated with each occupation. Hence, ﬁelds
contain information like Occupation Title, Occupation Description and
Tasks associated with each occupation were used from the O
*
NET to
estimate the similarity between each speciﬁc job advertisement found
online with the set
of
occupations
existing in the database.
It
is
important
to note that
O
*
NET only contains occupation types and
not the distribution or actual
frequency of these occupations.
This is
what we aim to quantify by matching each occupation in the database
with job advertisements appearing at popular career websites.
2.2.
Job postings
Job adverstisements were collected from a number of online jobs
sites
1
. Since our primary goal is to study the demand of jobs in diﬀerent
industries
existing at
the same or
diﬀerent
geographic
region we
collected 3814 job postings from the oil and gas industry in the GCC
countries (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain,
Kuwait),
and 1423 unique job postings from the banking and ﬁnance
sector in the same region. We also collected 3787 jobs’ advertisements
in the oil
and gas
industry in the following 5 US states:
Texas,
California,
Louisiana,
Oklahoma
and Pennsylvania.
According
to
American Petroleum Institute [6] these are the top 5 states in terms
of the total number of jobs directly or indirectly attributable to the oil
and gas industry.
Also,
the number of the jobs found here were very
similar to the number of jobs from the GCC. As with the GCC case, we
also extracted job postings for the banking and ﬁnance sector for these
5 US states.
However,
in this case the search yielded a much larger
number of
jobs than the 1423 found in the GCC area so a random
subset of jobs was sampled from the total pool of jobs. To investigate
further
the generalisability of
our
method,
we collected 1720 job
postings from the oil
and gas industry in UK (England,
Scotland,
Wales and Ireland),
and 2105 distinct jobs’
advertisements from the
banking and ﬁnance market in the same area.
2.3.
Pre-processing
Following common text-mining techniques,
we removed common
expressions
and words
from our
data
(both O
*
NET occupation
descriptions and job advertisements) to reduce its size and noise.
We
tokenized and deleted terms appearing only once as well as we reduced
the
vocabulary produced by deleting stop words
(e.g “and”,
“is”,
“thus”).
The next step was to manually review the remaining corpus
by ﬁltering out irrelevant terms or keeping in terms which incorrectly
were classiﬁed as invalid english words by the software used. After this
manual
data clean-up,
the last
step was to remove morphological
aﬃxes from words,
leaving only the word stem,
a process commonly
known as stemming (i.e a stemming algorithm reduces the words
“studying”, “studies”, and “student” to the root word, “study”).
3.
Proposed methodology
The next
sections describe how we applied LSI
to estimate the
demand of
O
*
NET occupations using job advertisement
documents.
Fig. 1 illustrates the procedure followed.
3.1.
Latent semantic indexing (LSI)
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is based on the idea that there are
hidden semantic relationships in the corpus data and that the connec-
tion between words and documents can be better elucidated in this
underlying space [7].
Initially, the O
*
NET occupation descriptions have to be transformed
into vectors to form a vector space. Each element in a vector represents
a word.
In this way,
the textual
data can be represented by a word-
document matrix X (
n
m
×
), where n is the size of the terms used and m
the size of O
*
NET occupation descriptions as it can be seen in Fig. 1.
Each element x
td
of matrix X represents the prevalence of term t in
document d,
weighted using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF) formula. Given a document corpus D, a term t and
a single document so that
d
D
∈
, we calculate weights as follows [8]:
t
f
D f
=
× log(|
|
)
d
t d
t D
,
,
(1)
where
f
t d
,
is the number of times the term t appears in document d,
D
|
|
is the size of the collection, and
f
t D
,
equals the number of documents in
which t appears in D.
The next step of a general LSI model is to perform a Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD)
on the matrix to identify the concepts/topics
contained in the text
(see Fig.
1).
The SVD of
our matrix X,
is the
product of three matrices:
X
LSR
=
T
(2)
where L and R are the matrices of the left and right singular vectors and
S is the diagonal matrix of singular values. The diagonal elements of S
are
ordered by
magnitude,
and therefore
these
matrices
can be
simpliﬁed by setting the smallest k values in S to zero.
The columns
of L and R that are associated to the elements of S that were set to zero
are removed.
The new product of these three matrices is a matrix X
k
that is an approximation of the term-by-document matrix.
This new
matrix represents the original
relationships as a set
of
orthogonal
factors (topics) where the term and document vectors can be seen as a
“semantic space” [7]. The quality of the SVD depends on the number of
factors that have to be used. To identify the optimal number of topics
we manually tested several
numbers of
factors from 10 to 100 and
qualitatively reviewed the results [9,10]. For each of these numbers we
performed SVD to estimate term and document loadings for each topic.
The number of topics k produced the best results was equal to 69. This
looks like a quite reasonable number if we consider the relatively small

size of our trained data (1110 O
*
NET occupation descriptions).
3.2.
Similarities and generation of weights
As
explained earlier,
LSI
was
used to transform the
O
*
NET
occupation data into a latent space of lower dimensionality.
This will
allow us to determine the similarity between a speciﬁc job posting
extracted from the Web and each of the O
*
NET occupations. Each job
posting is projected to a query vector Q
k
in the same k-dimensional
(k=69)
semantic
space that
the O
*
NET occupation collection had
previously
been transformed into.
This
is
achieved by
using the
following formula:
Q
S
L Q
=
k
T
−1
(3)
where S
−1
is the inverse of the diagonal matrix of singular values S, L
T
the transposed of
the left singular vectors matrix L and Q the term
vector.
Once each job posting is represented in this way,
the distance
between a given query and occupation vector can be estimated using an
appropriate distance measure.
A number
of
diﬀerent
metrics were
screened including the Pearson similarity,
Euclidean distance,
Bray-
Curtis
distance and Cosine similarity.
After
manually assessing a
sample of the scores produced by all these metrics the Cosine similarity
proved to be the most
suitable.
Given two vectors u
a
and u
b
their
Cosine similarity can be computed as follows [11]:
CosSim u
u
u
u
u
u
(
,
) =
·
|
|
× |
|
a
b
a
b
a
b
(4)
u
a
and u
b
are n-dimensional
vectors over the term set
U
u
u
=
, …,
n
1
.
Each dimension represents a word with its weight in the document,
which is non-negative. As a result, the Cosine similarity is non-negative
and bounded between [0,1].
However, the similarity scores produced this way cannot be used to
eﬃciently highlight and detect occupational clusters. That's because for
each occupation the corresponding Cosine similarity scores follow a
very standard decline from values that are close to 1 and end up to 0.
Thus,
since our goal
is to form a distribution of similarities for each
occupation that clearly distinguishes the job advertisements that are
similar
to this occupation from those that
are not
similar
we re-
calculated each Cosine similarity using the Sigmoid function described
in the following equation [12]:
Sigmoid x
L
e
(
) =
1 +
k x
x
− (
−
)
0
(5)
where e is Euler's number, x
0
the x-value of the sigmoid's midpoint, L
the curve's maximum value and k the steepness of
the curve.
This
approach resulted to scores between each job advertisement and the
O
*
NET data that exhibit a progression from higher values close to 1
that accelerate and approach to 0 over time.
The outcome of the previously described procedure is a similarity
vector S (
m
1 ×
) where m is the number of O
*
NET occupations (1110
distinct occupations were used). As Fig. 1 shows, each time we generate
p such vectors S where p is the number of the job postings extracted for
the industry and geographic area our method is applied on (i.e for the
banking and ﬁnance in GCC area n=1423).
To obtain a demand weight
for each single occupation we ﬁrst
normalize each similarity vector S using Eq.
(6) and then sum all
p
vectors into a single vector W. Each element of this vector is a demand
weight for each occupation of the O
*
NET database.

Validation
Crowdsourcing was used to validate our proposed LSI model.
For
this purpose, CrowdFlower
2
as a service platform was deployed which
allows users to access an online workforce of
millions of
people to
clean, label and enrich data.
Initially, a random sample of the extracted job postings was selected
in form of
similarity vectors
S.
As
described earlier,
each vector
contains similarity scores between the job posting being evaluated
and the 1110 O
*
NET occupations.
For
each of
those vectors
two
occupations were randomly chosen: one with corresponding similarity
score greater or equal to 0.9 and another one with score lower than 0.9.
Then, using CrowdFlower platform we created a task where people had
to
decide
for
each job posting
which of
the
two
given O
*
NET
occupations (for obvious reasons their similarity scores were hidden)
Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the applied methodology. The number of similarity vectors produced is equal to the number of the job postings extracted. After normalizing each of these
vectors we aggregate them into a single vector W containing demand weights for each O
*
NET occupation.

was the most similar to it.
According to [13] higher precision can be
achieved when humans have to decide among two options than when a
plethora of selections is provided.
To ensure the quality of the answers, 39 test questions were created
and every participant
that
did not
satisfy a threshold automatically
generated by the system was dismissed from the task. The experiment
was running for approximately two hours and 750 trusted responses in
total were obtained. A ﬁnal report that aggregated all the responses was
downloaded showing that 95.5% of the participants selected the O
*
NET
occupation for which our LSI model assigned similarity score
≥0.9
as
the most similar to the given job posting. These ﬁndings demonstrate
that
the
proposed LSI
model
succeeds
at
identifying
the
strong
correlations existing between the jobs advertisement documents and
the corresponding O
*
NET occupation data.
3.4.
Implementation details
All the analysis in this paper was conducted in Python. A number of
libraries
and toolkits
were used where specialized functions
were
required:
1. The BeautifulSoup library [14] was used for collecting and parsing
the job data from the Web.
2. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) [15] for preprocessing the corpus.
3. For
LSI,
we used the implementation provided in Gensim [16],
which also oﬀers a variety of
built-in functions for
text
mining
purposes.
4.
Results and discussion
Due to space constraints, Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 show only the top 10
prevailing O
*
NET occupations identiﬁed by the proposed method for
the oil and gas industry in GCC countries, USA and UK as well as for
the banking and ﬁnance sector in the same three regions.
As was described in Section 3.2, the degree of “match” returned by
the LSI model was used to infer the appropriate weighting for a given
occupation.
So for example,
in Table 1 for the case of GCC countries,
the occupation “Civil
Engineers” has a higher weighting compared to
that of “Mechanical Engineering Technologists” from which it may be
inferred that
more Civil
Engineering than Mechanical
Engineering
positions are available in the oil and gas industry, and hence that the
corresponding skills would be in greater demand. Note that this line of
analysis is not concerned with the economic value of any of these jobs,
merely the extent to which the skills related to these jobs are in demand
in the market.
Another component
in this line of
analysis is the generation of
intuitive visualizations using the generated weightings.
We tried a
number
of
methods
but
found that
reasonable
results
could be
obtained by applying Principal Components Analysis to the matrix of
occupations
and skills,
and then overlaying the
above-mentioned
weightings
to generate heatmaps.
Figs.
2,
3,
4,
5,
6 and 7 show
heatmaps for the diﬀerent
industries (oil
and gas vs.
banking and
ﬁnance) and geographical
areas (GCC countries USA,
UK) that
our
method was applied on. Each heatmap is visualized using the ﬁrst two
principal components from the occupations-skills matrix.
This matrix
was constructed using information in the O
*
NET database by combin-
ing the importance levels for three main job characteristics for each
occupation: Activities, Abilities and Skills [2,5].

dark grey color,
low demand areas in light
grey while intermediate
levels of
demand are assigned varying shades of
grey.
The resulting
heatmaps contain all of the occupations in O
*
NET and are too big to ﬁt
into the current format. Hence, in each heat-map we only depict three
occupation titles where each one belongs to a diﬀerent group of weights
and is representative of the results obtained for each case. Occupations
belonging to high demand areas
are coded with a “star”
symbol,
occupations in the medium demand group with a “triangle” one while
occupations in low demand are denoted with a “circle”.
Based on the results some observations are:
1. In comparison,
the ten most in demand occupations in the oil and
gas and in the banking sectors are clearly diﬀerent. In Tables 1, 2, 3,
many engineering professions are heavily weighted whereas this is
noticeably less so in the banking sector, as can be seen from Tables
4, 5 and 6.
2. The occupation heatmaps strongly support the previous observation:
while there is clearly a large diﬀerence between heat maps of the two
diﬀerent industries, heatmaps of the same industry but of diﬀerent
countries are broadly similar,
though there are also some diﬀer-
ences.
3. From Tables 2 and 3 there appears to be a greater managerial and/or
administrative
role
for
US
and UK branches
of
oil
and gas
companies, while recruitment for the same companies operating in
the gulf region (see Table 1) seem to focus more on technical

hardware aspects, as may be expected.
4. As stated above, the diﬀerences between Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are much
less pronounced but they are also not identical. This makes it harder
to pick out broad diﬀerences between these ﬁgures but it does look
like Figs. 3 and 4 show a slightly greater diversity of occupations (for
e.g. the upper left region has greater weight in both Figs. 3, 4). This
reﬂects a greater diversity of roles recruited for within the US and
UK market,
which would be expected as operations here cover a
broader portion of
the value chain ranging from exploration and
production to managerial,
ﬁnance and services.
Additionally,
the
bottom right region of
Fig.
4 is less weighted compare to that of
Figs. 2 and 3 supporting the empirical assumption that the demand
for technical
and engineering roles in UK within the oil
and gas
sector is low.
5. The banking and ﬁnance market for GCC countries is very similar to
that of USA and UK since the columns of Tables 4, 5 and 6 as well as
the corresponding heatmaps shown in Figs. 5, 6, 7 look almost the
same.
6. However, one interesting observation is the presence of the occupa-
tion “Spa managers” in Tables 4, 5 and 6. Initially, this may seem a
little strange, but if we were to look up the corresponding entries in
the O

NET, it will be seen that the database includes a list of related
occupations (i.e “Spa Managers” are in a group, which lists the group
of
“General
and Operations Managers” as related) that
share the
same skills. In addition, the skills corresponding to “Spa Managers”
are
quite
generic
(the
top
ﬁve
are
Speaking,
Monitoring,
Coordination,
Management
of
Personnel
Resources,
Service
Orientation),
and indeed are likely to be shared by many jobs in
the both oil and gas,
and banking sectors.
This illustrates how this
form of
analysis targets skills that
are in demand,
and not
just
speciﬁc occupations.

Conclusion and future work
In the current unpredictable economic environment occupational
data about the skills and attributes provided by databases like O
*
NET is
an essential
source of
information for
managers,
consultants
and
researchers
for
tracking
changes
in the
job
market
over
time.
Although O
*
NET database contains a detailed skill set for a represen-
tative sample of
occupations existing in the market,
this data is not
enough to characterize
the
distribution of
the
occupational
skill
demand. This paper proposed a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model
that utilizes O
*
NET occupational descriptions and raw job postings for
identifying the most demanded occupations in the job market regard-
less the industrial
sector and geographical
area is focused on.
Our
ﬁndings reveal
that
this technique produces much ﬁner
and more
timely readings of
the labor market compare to the common oﬃcial
employment or job opening statistics. In addition, one really valuable
property of the proposed method is that it can be directly applied to
diﬀerent job markets, commercial sectors and geographical regions - all
that is needed is a corpus of
jobs advertisements collected from the
target market. In this preliminary study this was performed using web
scraping scripts,
but if more reliable or detailed results are required,
customized data collection exercises can be performed by analysts.
The validation method presented here demonstrates the general
applicability of the proposed LSI model. As future work, we aim to use
our proposed data mining approach to conduct more in depth studies
on the speciﬁcs of skills changes in jobs markets,
and hence produce
speciﬁc policy or strategy recommendations. In addition, further work
might
focus on improving the pre-processing methods in order
to
reduce the noise in the data as well
as exploring more sophisticated
approaches for normalizing and aggregating the generated occupation
weights.
