Abstract—Topic Modeling, widely used and associated with 
text-mining applications, is a methodology that may be applied 
to other domains where the data generation process may be 
treated as a mixture model, and the underlying data objects 
modeled similarly to unigrams in the text-mining context. In 
this paper, we consider the application of topic-modeling to the 
RFID data generation process, and show how the resulting 
topics 
from 
topic-modeling 
are 
applicable 
to 
the 
RFID 
localization problem – particularly in challenging environments 
that have significant signal reflections or multi-path.

NTRODUCTION
Passive radio frequency identification (RFID) systems that 
follow the electronic product code (EPC) Global Class1Gen2 
and 
similar 
standards 
[1-2] 
are 
object 
identification 
technologies that provide a stream of data describing the 
objects outfitted with an RFID tag that are in the field-of-view 
of a reader. Often the goal of an application collecting data 
streams from RFID systems is not only to confirm that an item 
is in the field-of-view of an RFID reader, but to also localize 
the objects. This may be a difficult task depending upon the 
environments that an RFID system is deployed into. Many 
researchers 
have 
developed 
algorithms 
or 
augmentations 
based on conventional RFID systems to add a localization 
component [3-7]. These localization enhancements are often 
dependent on the in-situ environment of the RFID system, 
requiring assumptions about the environment in order to 
localize successfully, or they add an additional hardware 
element that may be cost prohibitive for large populations of 
tagged items [7]. 
One of the most popular – and intuitive – methods to add 
localization to an RFID system is to take advantage of the RF 
signal 
properties 
that 
are 
reported 
by 
the 
RFID 
reader, 
particularly the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), 
since this metric provides an indication of the received signal 
power delivered to an RFID tag. This metric tends to work 
well in open and uncluttered regions of space, where RFID 
tags are also well-separated and not densely packed together, 
since it takes advantage of the known 1/r
2
spreading of power 
density in an open environment from an RFID reader to a tag. 
Without the constraints of an open environment or well-
separated RFID tags, the RSSI-based localization often does 
not perform as well – as discussed in [7]. 
Other methods that use signal properties of the RF carrier 
in the RFID interrogation signal use the phase-component 
coupled with a model of the in-situ environment that may 
accommodate a few signal bounces, but loses accuracy in 
environments with additional reflections, referred to as multi-
path, since the receiver is unable to resolve the true direction 
that energy from a tag is emanating from relative to the RFID 
reader [5, 7-9]. 
In this paper, we describe a method for modeling the data 
generation aspects of an RFID system, which is based on the 
underlying stochastic process that embeds both the aspects of 
the RFID protocol coupled with the environment that the 
RFID system operates in. This model lends itself well to 
analysis 
techniques 
that 
are 
widely 
used 
in 
text 
mining 
applications to discover the latent clustering of terms or 
phrases into distinct topics, i.e., topic modeling as it known in 
the text-mining literature [10-13]. The application of topic 
modeling to RFID systems, operating on the RFID data stream 
generation may be used to provide localization information 
that improves upon what is possible from an RF signal 
parameter derived localization technique alone. Additionally, 
the probabilistic framework, as it will be shown, allows us to 
add some detail regarding how well the location information 
about a particular tag is known using this methodology. The 
method may also be useful in RFID system site surveys for 
optimization of antenna placements since it provides feedback 
on what latent tag distributions it is able to discover for a given 
antenna placement. Finally, as larger RFID systems are 
deployed, 
and 
the 
resulting 
processing 
requires 
that 
the 
incoming RFID tag reads are processed as data streams, we 
can take advantage of existing frameworks and tools for text-
based topic mining that operate on text data streams, to 
conduct topic mining on RFID systems.

LOCALIZATION IN MULTI
-
PATH ENVIRONMENTS
This section will briefly discuss some of the relevant 
physical constraints introduced as a result of RFID systems 
deployed into multi-path environments. As it was discussed 
in [7] RFID system performance decreases in realistic indoor 
environments, which is a result of multi-path, a result of 
objects being densely packed together, or a combination of 
both effects. As shown in [8], multi-path signals cause the 
energy impinging on a radio receiver in a communication 
system to appear as if it is coming from a number of clusters, 
a characteristic that is leveraged in multi-input multi-output 
(MIMO) communication systems where sufficient degrees of 
freedom are available to the radio using multiple antennas to 
resolve 
energy 
arriving 
from 
distinct 
clusters. 
Using 
conventional RFID interrogators, too few degrees of freedom 
are typically available to resolve all impinging paths or 
directions-of-arrival for multi-path signals, which may be 
time-varying 
as 
well, 
since 
objects 
move 
within 
the 
environment. These affects are further compounded in some 
operational environments that have metallic walls or large 
conducting objects that readily reflect RFID signals. Consider 
the example shown in Figure 1 of a small room, a circular 
cylinder 
with 
perfectly 
conducting 
walls 
as 
the room 
is 
modeled in Figure 1, where the magnitude of the electric field 
distribution – normal electric-field components – radiated by 
an RFID antenna is generated as shown using a recent version 
of the Computational Electromagnetic (CEM) simulation tool 
described in [14]. Three locations are sampled in the room as 
shown, and it is observed that point 1 – although closer to the 
antenna – has a smaller amount of power available to it at this 
point relative to points 2 and 3. Also, note that points 2 and 3 
have similar relative field strengths, indicating that if an RSSI-
based technique is used to localize in this environment, points 
2 and 3 will appear to be in the same location, and point 1 will 
appear to be further away.

tangential components are zero – in a small room with perfectly conducting

OCUMENT GENERATION
A data generation model of an RFID reader was discussed 
in [15] that models the data stream as a series of Bernoulli 
trials in order to smooth and clean RFID data streams. Each 
epoch from the reader represents a statistical sampling of the 
tags in the environment, and the inferred statistical properties 
for the reading of individual tags are used to smooth and 
interpolate data from the RFID readers. Conceptually this 
model makes intuitive sense as aggregating all of the effects 
associated with the multi-path environment, possible dense-
packing of RFID tags in specific regions of the region 
surrounding an RFID reader and its antennas, as well as the 
slotted-ALOHA protocol that the EPC Class1Gen2 standard 
uses for tag collision avoidance. 
A consequence of the RFID data generation model adopted 
in [15] follows from the de Finetti representation theorem 
[11, 13], which specifies that the RFID data stream model 
may be further represented as a mixture model. In text-
mining, the mixture model result leads to the representation 
of text documents as being generated by a set of topics, 
whereby 
each 
topic 
represents 
a 
latent 
probability 
distribution of words used by that topic. We propose that the 
topic modeling analogy is applicable to RFID data streams as 
well, and that suitable interpretations of the topic modeling 
concepts provide insight into the physical processes that lead 
to the RFID data stream results observed by RFID readers. 
Consider the RFID system denoted in Figure 2. A set of 
tags from three different clusters are shown, and two antennas 
are shown connected to the reader. The tag clusters may be 
thought of as the apparent spatial distribution of tags – 
possibly the multi-path components – as observed by a 
particular antenna or in aggregate by the RFID reader, and 
would be the equivalent of individual latent topics in topic 
modeling. A stream of tag reads is depicted in Figure 3, 
which arises from the system of Figure 2. Each sequence of 
tags or RFID epoch is equivalent to a document in topic 
modeling terminology, and the underlying RFID tags that are 
contained in each tag cluster are the equivalent of words or 
tokens in the text-mining context. Depending upon how 
documents are constructed to conduct topic modeling, we 
anticipate being able to decompose the spatial distribution at 
the reader or antenna level – or possibly a combination of 
antennas that resolve similar regions of space and have 
similar tag clusters or topics appear.

RFID tags.

PROBLEM OF INTEREST
With this background, we next discuss the problem of 
interest, which is to localize RFID-tagged objects within a 
room with walls that are reflective to radio frequency (RF) 
signals as depicted in Figure 4. This room has three NASA-
developed embedded RFID readers or EmbeRs – based on the 
commercially 
available 
ThingMagic 
M6e 
RFID 
reader 
modules – with a total of nine active RFID antennas (Antenna 
7 was disconnected for all experiments) distributed among the 
three readers as shown. Each reader operates independently 
of the others, and all readers may be active at the same time, 
using the EPC Global Class1Gen2 protocol as implemented 
by the readers to handle multiple reader-tag contention. The 
antenna and reader locations are highlighted in Figure 4, and 
are 
numbered 
for 
later 
reference 
and 
discussion. 
Also, 
installed in the room, and lining the walls in columns, shown 
in Figure 4, are 501 RFID tags used for calibration purposes. 
This quantity of tags is on the order of tags in the expected 
application environment. There are also three duffle bags that 
have an additional 138 tags to provide tags within the room 
volume that may be moved to different locations, and to 
provide 
a 
densely-packed 
population 
of 
tags 
– 
another 
identified challenge area from the earlier discussion. 
Figure 4. Test setup in room with significant multi-path due to conducting 
walls. 
Since our interest is in localizing RFID tags within this 
room, a reference case is shown in Figure 5, where the ground 
truth location is tied to a particular RFID antenna – or cluster. 
The metric for assigning tags to a cluster is to use a modified 
form 
of 
the 
Freespace 
Friis 
transmission 
equation 
[16] 
coupled with a simple and commonly used model of the 
radiated far-field for our antennas, which are a custom patch 
antenna design, in order to establish which antenna is closest 
to a particular tag. This is depicted in Equation 1, where the 
radiated power, P
rad
, gain of the RFID tag antenna, G
tag
, and 
gain 
of 
the 
RFID 
reader 
antenna, 
G
reader
, 
are 
chosen 
to 
normalize 
Equation 
1 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
multiplicative 
constant terms. This leaves the 1/r
2
and the pattern shape of 
the reader antenna as the important terms in the relation of 
Equation 1, where for the pattern shape we use a common 
approximation for the shape of the gain pattern from the 
antenna and set N=1 in Equation 1 for all of the reader 
antennas used in establishing the ground truth clustering of 
RFID tags in the environment. 
∝ 
, 
(1) 
It is important to note that the shape factor or antenna pattern 
of the tag antenna is important as well, but since the tag 
antenna orientation may vary considerably as objects are 
moved within the room, it is ignored for now and all tag 
antennas are assumed to be isotropic. 
Figure 5. Reference clustering for tag distribution in room at the antenna 
level – legend numbers correspond to antenna numbers in Figure 4.
Comparison between Figures 4 and 5 demonstrates an 
intuitive clustering of the tags, where the tags are assigned to 
the antenna that is effectively the closest based on the metric 
of Equation 1. Note that this result is the expected result in 
freespace, i.e, without reflections or other impairments caused 
by coupling of energy between tags that are densely-packed 
together. Based on our discussion of multipath effects and the 
other impairments of densely packed RFID tags, it is not a 
realistic expectation of how the energy is actually distributed 
in the room. Hence, even though we use this clustering as the 
ground truth, we do not expect perfect agreement between the 
ground truth and a “good” clustering result. In addition to 
clustering 
at 
the 
antenna 
level, 
we 
generate 
a 
reference 
clustering at the reader level in Figure 6, whereby the tags 
assigned to a particular antenna are aggregated to the reader 
connected to the respective antenna. In the case of Figure 6, 
we only consider the RFID readers 1 and 2 in the clustering, 
which produces a clear division between tags in the forward 
part of the room and tags in the aft part of the room. We also 
ignore the mobile duffle bags in this reference case, focusing 
instead on the tags that line the walls of the room, as a simpler 
case.

Prior to the application of topic modeling to the RFID tags 
within the room, we show in Figures 7 and 8, the clustering 
obtained using the RSSI-based method for the two different 
cluster configurations of Figures 5 and 6 respectively. We 
compare results using a common metric for comparing two 
hard-clustering 
cases, 
the 
normalized 
mutual 
information 
(NMI), which is defined in [17]. As a brief review, NMI takes 
on values between zero and one, whereby a value of one 
signifies that the two clusterings are identical and a value of 
zero signifies that the two clusterings share no information or 
overlap – similar to two random variables having a correlation 
coefficient 
of 
zero. 
NMI 
values 
between 
the 
reference 
clustering of Figure 5 and 6 and the RSSI-based clustering are 
recorded in Table 1. We observe that in both cases, the RSSI-
based clustering does not do a good job of clustering the tags 
relative to our ground truth since NMI approaches zero.

reads as clustering metric.

ESULTS
Next, we consider the application of topic modeling to our 
RFID dataset. To facilitate topic modeling on our data, we 
use the open-source topic modeling software, Gensim [18], 
and utilize the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, 
which is applicable to our RFID data model just as it is 
applied to text-mining problems, implemented in this library. 
To setup the topic modeling problem for use with Gensim, 
we construct corpora that consist of documents – first at the 
reader level – and in each document, we use the stream of 96-
bit EPC tag identification numbers as the tokens for use with 
LDA. Documents are equivalent to the epochs defined in 
[15] for our use of LDA, and the first method that is used to 
generate distinct documents is to sweep the transmit power 
settings on the reader and to create a new document each time 
the power is stepped to a new value. This method will be 
referred to here as the power step document generation 
method (PSDG). A second method for generating documents 
simply uses the switching between RFID reader antennas as 
the epoch demarcations that generate a new document, and 
will be referred to here as the antenna switching document 
generation method (ASDG). We refer to the collection of all 
documents generated using either method, at the level of an 
antenna or reader depending on context, as the corpus for that 
antenna or reader. It is this corpus that is decomposed into 
topics. Note that depending upon how fast the tags within the 
environment 
move, 
the 
ASDG 
method 
for 
generating 
documents may be preferred. For the experiments carried out 
in our room shown in Figure 4, there was not activity once 
the tag distributions were assigned so both the ASDG and 
PSDG methods would have stable channel statistics over a 
single epoch. 
Another consideration that was made for the problem of 
interest is that we need to generate a hard clustering of the 
results obtained from the topic model, as our reference case 
utilizes such a clustering. This will necessarily throw away 
some of the additional information that the topic model could 
provide, in particular we do not investigate whether the topic 
model results are indicative of the multipath clusters of tags, 
and whether we can separate these components in this paper. 
Instead we construct a corpus at either the reader or antenna 
level using either the PSDG or ASDG method to compose 
documents in the corpus. We then pick, M, topics, as 
obtained by the LDA algorithm for our corpus. An example 
of a single topic’s tag probability distribution using the PSDG 
method for Antenna 0, is shown in Figure 9. Note that 
because 
topics 
are 
a 
probability 
distribution, 
a 
nonzero 
probability will be assigned to all tags in the room. Hence, 
for each of the M topics in a given corpus, we set a cumulative 
probability cutoff, cdf
cutoff
, as depicted in Figure 10, where 
the cumulative probability distribution for the topic of Figure 
9 is plotted. Then we assign a tag as belonging to a particular 
corpus, at the reader or antenna level, based on the highest 
probability corpus associated with that tag. 
Applying 
this 
hard 
clustering 
methodology, 
and 
considering corpora generated at the reader level, results in 
the clustering of results shown in Figure 11, which uses 
cdf
cutoff 
= 0.8 and M=4. Note that this clustering result is 
much closer to that of the ground truth clustering in Figure 6 
relative to the RSSI method from Figure 8. In fact, we can 
adjust the threshold used in the cumulative probability cutoff 
for each topic to improve the accuracy of the clustering result 
from an NMI point of view. Using a lower cutoff reduces the 
amount of tags where a decision is actually made about which 
cluster it belongs to because we know that tags that are less 
likely – as determined by the topic model – should not be 
clustered by the model. Hence, we are able to dial-in the 
accuracy of assigning tags to clusters from the underlying 
data streams with this method. Table 2 describes results 
obtained using the LDA-based topic model and the hard 
clustering methodology described. We observe that we 
achieve a significant improvement in the localization of the 
tags using this method, and that we can dial in greater 
accuracy in the clustering if we set cdf
cutoff
to a lower value – 
which does reduce the number of tags that the model assigns 
to a cluster, but the tags that are assigned have a higher level 
of confidence in their cluster assignment.

The hard clustering methodology was applied at the antenna 
level as well, with results reported in Table 3. A number of 
different combinations of CDF and M values were tried with 
the general result that in order to obtain NMIs of similar 
values to the clustering results at the reader level, even lower 
CDF cutoffs are needed. Using lower CDF values, however, 
necessarily means that fewer tags are given a hard decision 
as to which cluster they belong to, and consequently we have 
many tags that are not clustered. This behavior is depicted in 
Table 
3, 
where 
the 
number 
of 
tags 
clustered 
is 
clearly 
observed to decrease as the value of NMI increases. It is 
important to note in this result, however, that setting the CDF 
to lower levels, ensures that our confidence in the clustering 
of a particular tag is higher, and yields increasingly better 
results for NMI. Since we have to set the CDF value to a 
lower value at the antenna level to ensure accuracy, we will 
revisit our assumption regarding the ground truth clustering, 
and its appropriateness in application to our test setup shown 
in Figure 4.

Since our original ground truth assumed a freespace type 
of clustering of tags, i.e., reflecting walls and interactions 
between tags are negligible, we recognize that comparing this 
reference case and our test setup is not ideal, which was borne 
out in our results at the antenna level in Table 3. To produce 
a clustering result that provides better localization than our 
reader level case, we considered the antenna level clustering 
for the case where CDF=0.5 and M=4 for topics generated at 
the antenna level, and observed that groups of antennas were 
often associated with particular regions of space. Four 
groups of antennas were formed, as described in Table 4, and 
the resulting ground truth tag assignments to these groups is 
shown in Figure 12. The grouping of the antennas was 
determined experimentally, and a more rigorous approach 
may yield better results. Note that the group structure is 
hierarchical with respect to the antennas belonging to each 
group, 
and 
that 
group 
four, 
for 
instance, 
is 
similar 
in 
operation to a background distribution in that it includes all 
of the antennas in generating a corpus for this group. As it 
turns out this background distribution maps to a particular 
region within our test setup – most notably the middle of the 
space in Figure 4.

Figure 12. Revised ground truth based on antenna level cluster frequency. 
Following application of topic modeling to the corpora 
generated from each group using the PSDG method, the NMI 
is calculated for a number of CDF and M combinations as 
shown in Table 5. Note that this table uses significantly 
higher values of CDF in filtering the tags observed for each 
topic relative to Table 3, and consequently the number of tags 
assigned to clusters is higher relative to the single antenna-
level results. We noted that the duffle bags, even with a 
background distribution that includes all antennas, still had a 
mixture of cluster assignments showing up inside. Consider 
the clustering shown in Figure 13 for CDF=0.5 and M=4. We 
observed that by removing duffle bags 1 and 2 from the 
clustering, the NMI changed from 0.345 with all tags, to 
0.436, and for CDF=0.2 and M=4 the NMI went from 0.433 
to 0.655 – a substantial improvement.

Figure 13. PSDG-based topic modeling using antenna groups from Table 4.
The inclusion of the duffle bags changed the NMI results 
of 
the 
clustering 
significantly 
since 
they 
represent 
a 
significant population relative to the entire population of tags 
located within the test setup, and the cluster assignment for 
each duffle bag was not homogeneous. Some of this is likely 
attributable to the somewhat random orientation of the tags 
within the duffle bags and the dense packing and obscuration 
of tags – issues discussed in sections I and II of this paper. It 
is interesting to generate histograms for the clusters observed 
in 
the 
duffle 
bags 
to 
determine 
the 
mixture 
of 
cluster 
assignments to tags within the duffle bags. Consider the 
distribution of cluster assignments inside duffle bag 1, as 
depicted in Figure 14. It is worth noting that cluster 4 has 
nearly four times as many tags associated with it as the next 
most frequent cluster. Considering duffle bag 3, we observe 
a similar trend, except for this duffle bag, cluster 1 is the most 
frequent. Given this interesting result, prior information 
regarding the association of tags within duffle bags may be a 
useful constraint to enforce. A simple post-processing step 
that assigns a duffle bag to the most likely cluster discovered 
via topic modeling is useful in improving results. For 
example, applying the most frequently occurring cluster to all 
tags in duffle bag 1, the entire bag is assigned to cluster 4 and 
duffle bag 3 is assigned to cluster 1. A similar assignment 
for duffle bag 2 assigns it to cluster 4. Applying this post-
processing step to all the duffle bags in our test setup, we then 
recalculate the NMI for our test cases from Table 5. Results 
for the revised NMI calculations are shown in Table 6, where 
we 
observe 
significant 
improvement 
in 
the 
overall 
performance of the clustering. 
Note 
that 
this 
improved 
performance 
can 
be 
carried 
further, by enforcing the same constraint on the columns of 
calibration tags in the test setup. Considering the case where 
CDF=0.4 and M=4 in Figure 16, there is only one column 
where 
the 
majority 
of 
tags 
identified 
through 
the 
topic 
modeling approach is not the same as reference case in Figure 
12. For the last clustering that enforces constraints from the 
calibration tags as well as the duffle bags, the NMI is 0.785, 
indicating a strong correlation between the ground truth 
clustering and the topic-modeling derived clustering. This 
good match between the two results includes all tags from the 
test setup of Figure 4.

ONCLUSIONS
We have applied concepts from topic modeling to an RFID 
data generation model that assumes the underlying RFID data 
streams are mixture models. The topic modeling results were 
shown to be a useful abstraction to determining clusters of 
tags 
that 
are 
spatially 
related 
for 
localization 
purposes. 
Additionally, it was shown that for tags that the topic-
modeling derived results has high confidence in, the cluster 
assignment was very good. An initial ground truth that 
followed a freespace arrangement of tags was shown to not 
work well as a reference case for the underlying tags as 
observed by the antennas. This is a known artifact from 
multi-path and tag-to-tag mutual coupling considerations, but 
the correct clustering of tags, at least as it is discoverable by 
the antennas, is not an easy task to discern. Other approaches 
that are able to determine tags that are being read with high 
confidence from particular antennas or groups of antennas 
may work similarly. In particular, it may be possible to 
assign high confidence to tags using just RSSI. In the 
authors’ experience, this metric alone is unlikely to work 
since 
changing 
channel 
characteristics 
or 
the 
multi-path 
environment tend to produce strong RSSI readings for tags at 
very different locations in the environment, e.g., consider the 
discussion of the example in Figure 1. Combining RSSI with 
another 
metric, 
like 
tag 
read 
counts, 
may 
be 
another 
possibility. This approach, however, starts to resemble term 
frequencies in text mining, and so it would not be surprising 
if 
this 
produced 
similar 
results 
to 
the 
topic 
modeling 
methodology. 
Applying topic models to the RFID data streams enabled 
us to determine that the original ground truth assumption was 
not a good representation for what the RFID readers actually 
observed, and that a more appropriate clustering of the data 
and grouping of tag antennas could better localize tags within 
our test setup. This latter step was completed heuristically 
and by inspection, however, we anticipate that in general use, 
either 
a 
supervised 
learning 
technique 
or 
unsupervised 
technique that attempts to maximize a parameter such as NMI 
using the output of the topic modeling results will be useful 
in discovering the best clustering of tags and establishing 
antenna groups for localization purposes. 
Additional post-processing steps may be needed to enforce 
known 
constraints 
where 
prior 
information 
about 
a 
population of tags is useful to improve the performance of the 
overall system. In our case, this manifested itself as using 
prior information about the contents of duffle bags and the 
arrangement of columns of calibration tags to improve the 
topic modeling results. It is expected that at some initial state 
the contents of the duffle bags will be known well, however, 
as time progresses an individual duffle bag’s contents may 
change leading to uncertainty in clustering tags that have 
lower probabilities in their association to discovered latent 
topics. 
In 
such 
cases, 
a 
variety 
of 
strategies 
may 
be 
employed, including those described in [19] for time-varying 
topic modeling. Exploration of these time-varying cluster 
relationship and strategies to build containment relationships 
for the contents of the duffle bags, similar to those employed 
in [6] are future work.
