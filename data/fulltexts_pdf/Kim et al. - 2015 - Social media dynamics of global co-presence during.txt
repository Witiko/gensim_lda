ABSTRACT
Sports games and other media events can induce very
strong feelings of co-presence that can change communi-
cation patterns within large communities.
Live tweeting
reactions to media events provide high-resolution data
with time-stamps
to understand these behavioral
dy-
namics.
We employ a computational focus group method
to identify 790,744 international
Twitter users,
and we
track their behavior before and during the 2014 FIFA
World Cup.
We pick a set of
Twitter users who spec-
ified the teams that they are supporting,
such that we
can identify communities of fans of the teams, as well as
the entire community of World Cup fans.
The structure,
dynamics,
and content of communication of these com-
munities are analyzed to compare behavior outside and
during the event and to examine behavioral
responses
across languages.
Specifically,
the temporal
patterns of
the tweeting volume,
topics,
retweeting,
and mention-
ing behaviors are analyzed.
We find similarities in the
responses to media events,
characteristic changes in ac-
tivity patterns,
and substantial
differences in linguistic
features.
Our findings have implications for designing
more resilient socio-technical
systems during crises and
developing better models of complex social behavior.

INTRODUCTION
Social
life depends on the presence of
others,
but the
nature of this co-presence can vary across contexts and
events.
Sporting championships,
entertainment specta-
cles, and other media events can induce very strong feel-
ings of co-presence that can in turn change the structure
and dynamics of
communication.
These changes were
traditionally impossible to measure, but social network-
ing services like Twitter have become “social
sensors”
capturing real-time reactions from large populations of
users [42,
44].
Twitter’s chronological
streams and in-
formation sharing practices have made it ideal
for sup-
porting interaction around current events [26,
29].
In
particular,
the practice of
“live tweeting” about what
users are watching during television broadcasts is con-
tributing to “social TV” experiences with high levels of
virtual co-presence [14, 15, 23].
Live tweeting reactions to media events provides high-
resolution data with time-stamps to understand behav-
ioral
dynamics,
relationships to analyze evolving social
structure,
and content to study changing psychological
states.
Making sense of
these large-scale and complex
data requires an interdisciplinary computational
social
science approach that integrates information retrieval,
natural
language processing,
statistical
modeling,
and
theories
from communication,
psychology,
and sociol-
ogy [30].
Developing methods and theories to under-
stand collective responses to large-scale events can be
used to design more resilient socio-technical systems for
supporting collaboration during crises and to develop
better models of complex social behavior [45].
In this paper, we use social sensor data from Twitter to
analyze how virtual co-presence during media events in-
duce changes in large-scale communication patterns.
We
employ a computational focus group method [33] to iden-
tify a population of 790,744 international Twitter users
and we track their behavior before, during, and after the
2014 FIFA World Cup.
Individual football matches are
social
occasions for high levels of
shared attention and
live-tweeting of these events generates very high levels of
activity.
We examine the structure, dynamics, and con-
tent of
communication by (i ) comparing behavior out-
side of the matches to behavior during the event and (ii )
analyzing behavioral
responses across languages in this
international population.
BACKGROUND
The social
behaviors and regulations that govern inter-
action in public life has been a major theoretical
con-
cern for sociologists and communication scholars.
Co-
presence is central to many theories and is marked by a
feeling of closeness in simultaneously experiencing what
others are doing and also knowing that others can per-
ceive what you are doing [18].
Not all
occasions are
equal
in importance and attention.
“Media events” are
social spectacles that are marked by a collective and mu-
tual
awareness that the event is being simultaneously
experienced by a large audience,
creating a feeling of
co-presence that is extremely enthralling compared to
events that are less important or of narrower interest [9].
Despite the lack of
reciprocity between spectator and
performer,
mass media consumption can be occasions
for sustained and focused social
interaction.
Television
viewers often attempt to actively converse or participate
with on-screen actors
rather
than passively observing
the production in a process known as para-social
inter-
action [25].
People enjoy socializing around their con-
sumption of television and other media, even when these
media are not the sole focus of attention [11, 14, 34].
Si-
multaneously watching online videos and participating in
online chat can also enhance the experience of watching
poor-quality videos and promote stronger relationships
among friends and strangers alike [46].
During a media event, Twitter is used as a backchannel
where users converge and establish co-presence by using
official
and emergent hashtags as channels for commu-
nal
commentary in reaction to a live-broadcast.
Par-
ticipation in this
backchannel
requires
users
to use a
“second screen” such as a laptop or mobile device to
monitor and participate in the social
stream of
tweets
while simultaneously watching the “first screen” of
the
television broadcasting the event.
This “dual screening”
allows users to share their own para-social
reactions in
the backchannel, create and reinforce social relationships
with other viewers who are also dual
screening,
make
sense of discrepant incidents through information shar-
ing or humorous improvisation, and potentially see their
tweets incorporated into journalists’
summaries or the
broadcast itself [15, 23].
Users’ behavior may switch from conversational orienta-
tion towards a known network to self-promoting procla-
mations towards an imagined audience [5,
35].
Users
who were previously reluctant to share popular infor-
mation for fear of
over-saturating their followers may
become more likely to retweet it to acknowledge their
participation in the event [16].
For example, tweets dur-
ing the 2012 U.S.
presidential
debates were marked by
sharp decreases in interpersonal communication (replies
and mentions) and concentrated attention (replies and
retweets) toward elite users [31].
The sentiment of reac-
tions in the Twitter stream also reflects changes in users’
support for candidates during political debates [10, 33].
While
prior
scholarship has
examined the
extent
to
which events can be detected and summarized from so-
cial
media streams [3,
37,
44],
there is little research
on the changes in social
media behavior and structure
within the same population over time [31, 33].
RQ1:
Do users’ activity patterns vary between me-
dia events and normal times?
Given the complex demands on attention, users’ behav-
ior during media events should differ significantly from
non-events.
Activity will
increase during conditions of
shared attention during matches and fall
back to base-
lines after the match concludes.
Shared attention to media events also generates cognitive
co-presence characterized by a common ground of
mu-
tual expectations and knowledge about what is happen-
ing on the broadcast.
In typical
conversations,
partici-
pants need to engage in various forms of coordination by
presenting and accepting messages to ensure what they
have said was understood [8].
However,
media events
should reduce the need to engage in this coordination by
increasing the certainty that the audience for a message
shares the same immediate context and experience [38]:
not only is everyone watching the broadcast,
everyone
knows that everyone is watching the broadcast.
This
cognitive co-presence leads to diminished collaborative
effort which should lead to significant changes in linguis-
tic features of speech during media events.
RQ2:
How does topical diversity change during an
event?
Shared attention should increase
common ground as
viewers hold common understandings of an event.
This
will reduce the need for linguistic coordination and also
reduce the diversity of topics during the event.
Another important but overlooked dimension of shared
attention to media events is the role of linguistic and cul-
tural
diversity.
The international
audience for a media
event like the World Cup should reveal
global-scale en-
gagement with multi-lingual users, who serve as bridges
between otherwise isolated language communities [12,
20, 24, 13].
Activity patterns across languages show very
high levels of
similarity and geo-located tweets reveal
community structure and polarization reflecting histor-
ical
and cultural
boundaries [36].
Linguistic similarity
can also reflect underlying cultural
affiliations and soli-
darity as individuals accommodate their partners by em-
ploying similar linguistic and topical styles [17, 39, 43].
RQ3:
How do users’
topics vary with proximity
between countries?
Users in geographically proximate countries should ex-
hibit greater topical similarity than users in more distant
countries [22].
In the context of a sporting tournament,
the fans of eliminated teams should also adopt the top-
ical
features employed by fans whose teams are still
in
competition.
RESEARCH DESIGN
Tweets
are nearly-ideal
social
sensors
that
involve a
large-scale population,
provide immediate feedback to
events,
and allow users 140 characters of
unstructured
text to express themselves.
A common method for an-
alyzing tweet streams is to na¨ıvely aggregate tweets for
basic summary statistics or sentiment analysis,
which
makes assumptions that the population of Twitter users
or the processes they use are constant.
This is not the
case in the context of media events, marked by high lev-
els of
shared attention,
where the population of
users
and norms for writing tweets change dramatically [31].
Instead,
we adopt a computational
focus group model
to identify a relevant sub-population and then track its
behavior
before,
during,
and after
media events
[33].
This approach has several benefits as we define a large-
scale population sharing a relevant characteristic ahead
of time and track only these users’
tweets.
We identify
and differentiate users (“supporters”) based on Twitter
users declaring their allegiance for a specific team by
tweeting a link
1
to a Twitter web page.
Data
The 2014 FIFA World Cup ran from June 12th to July
13th and involved 32 teams playing in a round-robin
tournament for the first (“group”) stage followed by a
single elimination tournament of 16 teams in the second
stage.
We identified 1,028,756 supporters who tweeted a
link indicating their support for a team.
Using requests
for user timelines from the Twitter REST API,
2
we
retrieved up to the 3,200 most recent tweets for each of
these users and removed users who posted a link with-
out reference to a team, posted links to multiple teams,
or posted fewer than five tweets during the tournament.
After this cleanup, our dataset consisted of 790,744 sup-
porters and 129,793,095 tweets.
Table
1 summarizes the distribution of activity among
supporters across the 26 national teams that have official
Twitter accounts.
We computed the average number of
tweets these supporters made during the World Cup as
well
as their average number of followers and friends in
August 2014.
We observe wide variation in the activ-
ity and connectivity of supporters across these national
teams.
While we use all
of
the supporters for analy-
sis to see the global trend of supporter behavior during

matches and between matches, we choose the four most
popular teams, Brazil, USA, Argentina, and Germany, to
analyze the behaviors of their supporters in more detail.
Out of
those four teams,
three (Brazil,
Argentina,
and
Germany) reached the final four, whereas the USA team
was knocked out of
the tournament after the round of
sixteen.
This provides interesting data, both in the form
of repeated observations of events involving the team as
well as for measuring shifts in affiliations from supporters
of knocked-out teams.

automatically identifies language.

In Figure 1,
the in-
ner pie chart shows the distribution of top four popular
teams and the rest of teams and the outer pie chart is
the distribution of supporters’ languages for each team.
The languages used most, based on the user profile, are
English (en),
Spanish (es),
Portuguese (pt),
German
(d e).
There are interesting anomalies such as English
and Spanish having the largest language share among
the supporters of the German team.
Hashtags, Mentions, and Retweets
Hashtags,
mentions and retweets are popular features
in Twitter
that
provide various
mechanisms
of
infor-
mation sharing among users.
Hashtags group messages
with similar
topics
or
events,
thereby allowing users
to band together quickly and easily around a central
theme.
Mentions allow users to address messages (which
are still
public) to specific users,
thereby allowing di-
rected communication rather than broadcasts of
mes-
sages.
Finally,
retweets
(RTs)
propagate information
through user’s networks,
spreading important messages
quickly and widely throughout the twittersphere.
Ana-
lyzing the patterns of supporters’ usage of these features
during a global event can reveal important signals about
shared attention [31].
With retweets and mentions,
we count,
normalize,
and
compare the frequencies before,
during,
and after each
match for each team.
We count the number of RTs by
each team’s supporters on an hourly basis, then normal-
ize the counts by the total
amount of
tweets by those
supporters during each corresponding hour.
When we
visualize these numbers,
we can see definite temporal
dynamics.
Mentions are analyzed in the same way.
For hashtags, we look beyond the frequency of all hash-
tags being used before,
during,
and after the matches.
We look at the unique counts of World Cup related hash-
tags compared to non-World Cup hashtags, and the to-
tal
counts of
those hashtags.
We expect to see a high
frequency of hashtag usage, especially for World Cup re-
lated hashtags, during the match, but we do not expect
the unique number of hashtags to change much.
To iden-
tify the hashtags for World Cup related topics, we note
that during this World Cup,
Twitter promoted World
Cup related hashtags.
Specifically,
they translated the
word “worldcup2014” in multiple languages,
and they
promoted three letter team codes (e.g., #BRA, #GER),
and hashtags of each match by the team codes of the two
teams playing (e.g., #BRAvsGER). By analyzing tweets
with identical hashtags, we can analyze the adoption of
World Cup hashtags among supporters.
Topic Modeling
One key question of
shared attention is whether sup-
porters’ tweets are focused around a shared set of topics
while watching the matches.
To answer that question,
we analyze the topics of
tweets using latent Dirichlet
3
https://blog.twitter.com/2013/
introducing-new-metadata-for-tweets
allocation (LDA), a probabilistic topic model which dis-
covers topics,
defined as a probability distribution over
the vocabulary,
from a corpus of unannotated text in a
totally unsupervised fashion [4].
LDA would discover,
for
example,
a topic with the top probability words
{worldcup, soccer, player, goal}.
We wish to discover the
topics used by the supporters during matches of
their
teams,
during matches of other teams,
and during non-
match time.
Thus,
we create three documents for each
user, one for tweets from the user during a user’s team’s
matches (MYM for “my matches”),
second for tweets
from the user during other teams’
matches (OTM for
“other team matches”),
and third for tweets from the
user during all other times (NOM for “no match”).
We
aggregated the users’ documents by the teams they sup-
port,
such that we have a corpus of
MYM,
OTM,
and
NOM tweet-documents for each team.
We then ran LDA
on those corpora using gensim [41].
For LDA hyperpa-
rameter settings,
we fixed T = 100 for the number of
topics, α = 1/T , and β = 1/T as suggested in [19].
RESULTS
Changes in activity patterns
RQ1 asked if users’
activity patterns vary between me-
dia events and normal times.
We hypothesized that dur-
ing the matches,
supporters would show a high level
of
shared attention,
thereby communicating and interact-
ing much more actively compared to other times.
Specif-
ically,
we measure and analyze the volume of tweets as
well as retweets, mentions, and hashtags normalized for
the total volume and find evidence of significant changes
in communication patterns during events compared to
behavior outside of events.
Figure 2 shows the tweeting activity of supporters before
and during the World Cup.
Supporters show a general
increase in tweeting behavior throughout the matches
compared to the days before,
reflecting the increasing
levels of shared attention as fewer teams remain in play.
Within each team, supporters show a definite pattern of
intense tweeting during the matches as each team shows
a distinctive pattern of peaking at different times.
For
example, Germany and Argentina, which played in the fi-
nal round for the title, both peak during that final match.
Brazil peaks during the semi-final match between Brazil
and Germany.
USA peaks at the round of 16 (at which
point they are out of the tournament) but they maintain
a steady amount of activity until the end.
Figure 3 plots the normalized activity levels for the pop-
ulations of supporters of Germany, USA, Argentina, and
Brazil.
Across all four examples, we find similar evidence
of
retweets making up the largest share of
tweets,
fol-
lowed by tweets containing mentions, and finally tweets
containing hashtags.
Comparing different behaviors dur-
ing and outside game times,
we find that mentions fall
while retweets rise during games.
This replicates prior
findings that interpersonal communication declines while
rebroadcasting increases during these events [31].

Mentions show a reverse pattern of
decreasing during moments of
shared attention.
This is
consistent with previous work explaining that mentions
occur relatively infrequently during shared attention.
also observe significant variation in the rate of hashtag
usage, a topic we explore more in the next section.
Figure 4 shows the dynamics of retweeting for Brazil sup-
porters (green) and Argentina (blue), normalized by the
total number of tweets from these supporters.
Retweets
peak during important events as users prioritize spread-
ing and responding to the existing messages rather than
generating new messages.
Because “dual
screening” is
cognitively demanding, this suggests users are temporar-
ily adopting alternative behaviors to communicate with
their networks as well as signal their membership in the
event.
After
the event
ends,
the retweeting rate re-
turns to normal
levels reinforcing the hypothesis that
these anomalous behaviors are driven by the exigencies
of shared attention to media events.
Although Argentina
and Brazil
never played each other in the tournament,
they exhibit strong coupling of activity patterns.
These
archrivals both have spikes when the other team is play-
ing,
which suggests
that
supporters
of
Argentina are
closely following and responding to the Brazil games and
vice versa.
This reflects a generalized kind of media event
induced co-presence in which affinity as well as (presum-
ably) animosity induces significant changes in communi-
cation behaviors across large populations of users.
Figure 5 shows the dynamics of
hourly total
mentions
during World Cup,
normalized by the total
number of
tweets.
The mention ratio significantly drops
during
important matches.
This suggests that directive com-
munications are not happening during shared attention.
After the event ends, the mention rate returns to its nor-
mal
levels,
which suggests such dynamics are driven by
the exigencies of
shared attention to media events.
To
validate the significance of
retweet,
mention and hash-
tag frequency between match days and non-match days,
we computed two-sided t-tests for top 4 most popular
teams,
Brazil,
Germany,
Argentina and USA,
between
each team’s match days and non-match days.
The p-
values for these tests were all lower than 0.001.
Changes in topical diversity
RQ2 asked how topical
diversity changes
during an
event.
The large number
of
people attending to an
event might introduce more hashtags into the ecosys-
tem as supporters improvise humorous titles or try to
find backchannels with less noise.
However, we hypoth-
esized that shared attention should decrease the needs
for linguistic coordination and thus reduce the diversity
of
topics while the event is happening.
As we discuss
below,
we find evidence for both increasing number of
hashtags as well as decreasing entropy in conversations.

Figure 6 plots
the changing number
of
all
hashtags,
which fluctuates during games and steadily grows until
the end of World Cup.
World Cup matches,
as shared
experiences, drive drastic increase of hashtag generation
(blue line),
which are driven primarily by changes in
hashtags frequency related to World Cup (green line).
The number of official World Cup hashtags also follows
similar trends during the same period of time.
Each peak
happens at important matches, such as semi-final and fi-
nal
matches.
However,
the number of
unique hashtags
stays steady throughout World Cup in the figure.
These
results show that users demonstrate a limited adoption of
hashtag variety, but the frequency of hashtags increases
as shared attention to a media event intensifies.
To quantify shared attentions during World Cup matches
using hashtags,
we computed entropy values (p-values
less than 0.001) for the hashtags used each day from
June 10 to July 15.
Lower entropy values manifest as
sparser distributions and indicate tweets were concen-
trated in fewer hashtags while higher entropy values rep-
resent denser distributions reflecting tweets using many
more hashtags.
In contrast to the emergence of
more
hashtags during the matches from Figure 6 above,
Fig-
ure 7 shows that the entropy of
hashtag use falls dra-
matically during matches.
This indicates that the event
unifies attention of
Twitter users and triggers users to
tweet using the same hashtags.
We also observe a nega-
tive trend towards the final match,
indicating a general
loss of diversity in hashtag use over the course of the en-
tire World Cup.
We interpret this as users concentrating
their attention more intensely on fewer teams.
We computed analogous entropy measures (p-values less
than 0.001) for the distribution of
topics for each sup-
porter’s
tweets
during matches
when their
team was
playing (MYM), when another team was playing (OTM),
and when there was no match being played (NOM). We
provide examples of
these tweets in Table 3.

summarizes these differences in average entropy values
across all users among all teams as well as breaking out
results for each of the top four teams we discussed above.
Using the MYM as a baseline, we see that topical diver-
sity for users during others’
matches (OTM) increases
by 4.4% on average while topical
diversity increases by
14.29% outside of
match time.
Such findings indicate
that media event-induced co-presence can trigger signif-
icant changes in communication content.
We identified two topics that show high probability for
MYM and lower probabilities for OTM and NOM. Sim-
ilarly,
we identified two topics that show high proba-
bility for NOM and lower probabilities for MYM and
OTM,
both for the top two languages for each team.

Troughs during important matches are highly

English-speaking Brazil
supporters tweeted about top-
ics
Match and Players,
topics
closely related to the
World Cup.
Similar
to English-speaking Brazil
sup-
porters,
Portuguese-speaking Brazil
supporters tweeted
about World Cup topics, Score and Players, during the
matches.
When there is no match,
supporters tweeted
about Media and General
topics.
The difference between
English-speaking and Portuguese-speaking Brazil
sup-
porters is that Portuguese-speaking supporters tweeted
about Brazilian soccer players, whereas English-speaking
supporters posted non-Brazilian soccer players during
Brazil
matches.
Both German-speaking and English-
speaking Germany supporters had Final
topics related
to their Final match against Argentina.
One interesting
topic found in NOM for German-speaking Germany sup-
porters is Israel-Gaza conflict(Gaza) topic,
which hap-
pened on July 8,
2014.
Finally,
USA supporters also
show World Cup related topics for MYM,
however,
top
words lists do not contain their team but other team or
player names.
Early elimination of US team may have
resulted in fewer tweets about topics related to the team.
Geographical and topical proximity
RQ3 asked if users’ topics vary with proximity between
countries.
We expected that supporters from geograph-
ically proximate countries should exhibit greater topical
similarity than supporters from more distant countries
owing to linguistic accommodation and style matching.
We ran LDA using all tweets from every team’s support-
ers during the championship match of Argentina versus
Germany.
The output of
LDA are “topics” which are
probability distributions over the vocabulary,
often vi-
sualized as the list of top probability words, as shown in
Table 4.
Another output,
which is referred to as θ [4]
and is computed for each document in the corpus, is the
vector of probabilities for each topic.
That is, for each of
k topics found by LDA, the value of the kth dimension of
θ
d
represents the proportion of topic k within document
d.
For our data, we aggregate all of the tweets from each
supporter during the Argentina vs Germany match into
a single document,
so θ
d
is the vector of
topic propor-
tions for the tweets written by that supporter during that
particular match.
We ran LDA on the set of such docu-
ments for all
supporters of all
teams,
then we averaged
the thetas for all supporters of each team.
Then we com-
puted the similarity between each of these teams’ average
topic proportions and the Argentinean supporters’ aver-
age topic proportions using Pearson’s correlation, which
ranges from -1 (no correlation) to +1 (high correlation).
Table 8 plots these topical
similarities.
Figure 8 plots
these topical similarities as a function of the normalized
geographic distance between the centroids of each coun-
try i:
−
p
|(x
ARG
− x
i
) + (y
ARG
− y

)|.
We observe a
very strong fit between geographic distance and topical
similarity during this final and highest shared attention
event; neighboring countries like Uruguay and Chile ex-
hibit the highest similarity while distant countries like
South Korea and Japan have very low similarity.
We replicate these results using Germany as a compar-
ison in Figure 9.
We find a weaker but similar pat-
tern in which neighboring countries like Belgium and the
Netherlands have some of the strongest similarities while
distant countries like Colombia and Uruguay have lower
levels of similarity.
However, there are some outlier coun-
tries that violate this pattern such as Australia, which is
distant but similar,
and France,
which is close but dis-
similar.
These suggest other factors may play a stronger
role in some cultural contexts than distance alone.
DISCUSSION
The 2014 FIFA World Cup was a media event that gen-
erated intense levels of shared attention.
This attention
manifested itself in fans’ communication patterns as they
used Twitter to generate high levels of social co-presence.
We identified a population of 790,744 Twitter users who
explicitly expressed an allegiance for a team and clus-
tered their behavior together to compare across teams
and games.
Unlike prior work that has examined large-
scale behavior changes during shared attention to media
events in the context of national political events [31], this
study collected data about people with diverse linguistic
and cultural backgrounds responding to the same event
of international importance.
Using a “computational fo-
cus group” data collection strategy [33], we were able to
collect public data about large-scale behavioral
change

while preserving our ability to conduct within-subjects
analyses.
Specifically, we were able to compare the same
users’
behavior before,
during,
and after media events
rather than trying to generalize from posts matching a
single hashtag.
This permitted us to extend prior find-
ings about media event-induced co-presence as well as to
understand how their behavior and content changes in
response to heightened levels of co-presence.
For RQ1, we observed significant increases in the volume
of tweets made during the matches as supporters “dual
screen” to tweet about what they were watching during
the matches.
During matches,
the rate of re-tweets in-
creased while the rate of mentions decreased.
Similarly,
the number of
hashtags generated during the matches
increased significantly but with low rates of adoption by
users.
Large populations simultaneously attending to
multiple media sources may impose high levels of
cog-
nitive overhead,
which leads to the adoption of
differ-
ent collective behaviors.
In effect,
users perform differ-
ent roles or assume new identities during media events
compared to their “everyday” identities outside of
me-
dia events.
Users de-emphasize interpersonal
commu-
nication like mentions because they potentially want to
reach a broader audience during the event or it is difficult
to enter this information quickly enough to be relevant.
RQ2 asked how topical
diversity changes during these
events.
We found the overall entropy of hashtags used in
the aggregate conversation during matches actually fell
significantly below the baseline outside of the matches.
While hashtags are an imperfect measure of linguistic di-
versity,
they are examples of temporary linguistic com-
munities reflecting a form of
coordination among users
to speak to larger audiences [7,
32].
The reduction in
diversity we observed during games points to a profound
desire to interact synchronously with a global
audience
despite the presence of
language barriers or absence of
their own team.
RQ3 asked how fans’ topics varied with the proximity be-
tween the countries.
We found that the makeup of topics
that supporters discussed varied depending on whether
their team was playing, and the similarity of supporters’
topics in the championship match was correlated with
the distance between the countries.
The role of
social
identification with the team as well
as the geographic
proximity to the focal team’s country broadens our un-
derstanding of
how a multi-lingual
and multi-cultural
online community understands and responds to shared
topics of interest [12, 13, 20].
Implications
Despite popular perceptions that new technologies have
made television less social
as it moves from the “pub-
lic” family room to more “private” mobile devices,
our
findings contribute to the tradition of “interaction tele-
vision” within HCI scholarship as well
as related con-
cepts like “social TV” [21, 14].
The use of Twitter dur-
ing media events like the World Cup has implications
for (1) developing new theories around temporary and
synchronous social
behavior within socio-technical
sys-
tems, (2) designing technology to support implicit social
interactions under mediated co-presence, and (3) under-
standing cross-cultural and multilingual interaction.
Prevailing scholarship about online communities empha-
sizes the importance of encouraging contributions,
pro-
moting commitment,
regulating behavior,
and socializ-
ing newcomers [28], but this research often proceeds from
assumptions that
motivations to participate in online
communities are constant over time.
However, the media
event-induced co-presence we observed around the World
Cup adds to related scholarship around crisis informat-
ics that explores how communities can temporarily coa-
lesce in response to exogenous factors [40].
Lessons from
these emergent and temporary communities can inform
the design of
online communities generally to promote
greater resiliency under stress as well
as responsiveness
to boundary conditions like the “bursty” dynamics we
observed.
Moreover,
the ubiquity of these “bursty” dy-
namics throughout human social behavior [1] invites ad-
ditional
theoretical
and empirical
scholarship to under-
stand how these episodes support the adoption and diffu-
sion of technologies and practices throughout the com-
munity,
socialize new members into substantive roles,
and structure users’ online and offline social lives.
Seen through a theoretical
lens,
our
findings
suggest
users share temporary normative expectations to not im-
pinge on their friends’ attention to the game by sending
notifications that might distract them.
Implicit inter-
actions are pervasive in social
life as we accommodate
our behavior and interactions to varying contexts and
demands for attention and levels of initiative [27].
How-
ever,
many systems
are notoriously bad at
managing
implicit interactions as machines demand our attention
through notifications that occur without the explicit re-
quest of
a user.
Although further research is needed,
users’ varied uses of retweets and mentions during these
events may reflect meta-cognitive attempts to avoid be-
haviors that generate notifications for their friends (texts
and mentions) that,
in turn,
create obligations break-
ing their friends’
attention to events both are enjoying.
During highly synchronous and co-present media events,
users
may potentially employ implicit
interactions
by
adopting behaviors and shifting communication to less
disruptive channels like retweets and favorites that do
not create obligations to reply.
Systems could be de-
signed that incorporate individuals’ or large-scale popu-
lations’ social media streams as sensors for the availabil-
ity and “distractability” of users for system notifications.
Finally, our results around global co-presence can inform
research and design for multi-lingual interaction.
While
the World Cup is a unique event, which potentially lim-
its the generalizability of our findings to more common
media events,
these media events are also ideal
empiri-
cal
settings for measuring cross-cultural
behavior.
The
inherent noisiness of Twitter data for measuring context
and sentiment within — much less across — languages
is widely acknowledged [2,
6],
but media events allow
researchers to measure the within-subject responses of
a large global
population to the same stimulus.
The
potential
for corpora like this to aid in benchmarking
new methods for multilingual content analysis, as well as
comparing communication behaviors across cultures and
geographies,
is immense.
These corpora likewise reveal
different cultural constructions of the same events as well
as the role of multilingual
users in bridging geographic
and cultural divides within online communities [20, 22].
