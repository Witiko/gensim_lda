Abstract
With the advent and popularization of Online Social Networks and Social Network-
ing Services, computer science researchers have found fertile field for the development
of studies using large volumes of data, multiple agents models, and spatio-temporal
dynamics. However, even with a significant amount of published research on the sub-
ject, there are still aspects of social networks whose explanation is incipient. In order
to deepen the knowledge of the area, this work investigates phenomena of collective
sharing on the network, characterizing information diffusion events. From the obser-
vation of real
data obtained from the online service Twitter,
we collect,
model
and
characterize such events, from a perspective of complex systems. Finally, using ma-
chine learning and computational data analysis, patterns are found on the network’s
spatio-temporal processes, making it possible to classify a message’s topic from users
behaviour and to characterize individual behaviour from social connections.
Keywords: Online Social Networks; Complex Systems; Machine Learning

Resumo
Com o surgimento e a populariza¸c˜
ao de Redes Sociais Online e de Servi¸cos de Redes
Sociais, pesquisadores da ´
area de computa¸c˜
ao tˆem encontrado um campo f´ertil para
o desenvolvimento de trabalhos com grande volume de dados,
modelos envolvendo
m´
ultiplos agentes e dinˆamicas espa¸co-temporais. Entretanto, mesmo com um signifi-
cativo elenco de pesquisas j´
a publicadas no assunto, ainda existem aspectos das redes
sociais cuja explica¸c˜ao ´e incipiente. Visando o aprofundamento do conhecimento da
´
area,
este trabalho investiga fenˆ
omenos de compartilhamento coletivo na rede,
que
caracterizam eventos de difus˜
ao de informa¸c˜
ao. A partir da observa¸
c˜ao de dados re-
ais oriundos do servi¸co online Twitter, tais eventos s˜ao modelados, caracterizados e
analisados sob a perspectiva de sistemas complexos. Com o uso de t´ecnicas de apren-
dizado de m´
aquina e an´
alise computacional
de dados,
s˜
ao encontrados padr˜
oes nos
processos espa¸
co-temporais da rede, tornando poss´ıvel a constru¸c˜ao de classificadores
de mensagens baseados em comportamento e a caracteriza¸
c˜ao de comportamentos
individuais, a partir de conex˜
oes sociais.

Acknowledgements
Talvez uma das conclus˜oes mais importantes que tiro deste per´ıodo de investi-
ga¸c˜ao do mestrado ´e o refor¸
co da cren¸ca do quanto somos influenciados e dependentes
de nossos pares. Por mais que consiga ver esfor¸
co pessoal nessa trajet´
oria, n˜ao ouso
deixar de reconhecer que, se chego a algum lugar novo, ´e gra¸cas a muitas pessoas.
Por ordem cronol´
ogica,
gostaria de primeiro agradecer a meus pais,
Paulo e
Anita e a meu irm˜ao Pedro, pela base de toda educa¸c˜
ao, motiva¸c˜
ao e sonhos que eu
possa ter.
Por mais criativo que eu possa querer ser em minha vida,
n˜
ao h´a como
negar a influˆencia e inspira¸
c˜ao vindas de vocˆes, que sempre far˜
ao parte de mim. Pelo
mesmo motivo, tamb´em agrade¸
co `
a fam´ılia estendida, principalmente aqui aos meus
av´
os Luiz e Brasil, que sempre acreditaram muito em mim e n˜
ao pouparam incentivos
para a minha forma¸c˜
ao.
T˜
ao importante quanto a fam´ılia, quero me lembrar dos amigos que tˆem me
ensinado e me influenciado muito.
Aos amigos da ABU,
que marcaram a minha
gradua¸c˜
ao e o mestrado,
sou muito grato por tudo.
Em especial,
aos moradores da
Casa Douglas, com os quais pude dividir ainda mais: Bacon, Bember, Carla, Jonas,
Pedro Ivo,
Mauˆe,
Eliezer,
Nathan,
Micael,
Edu,
Gabriel,
Davi,
Glauber,
Daniel
e
Juari.
Aos grandes amigos da IPBG,
Caio,
Pri
Gomes,
Elmo,
Salatiel,
Pri
Akemi,
Rˆomulo, Sabrina, Tovo, Daniel.
Aos colegas da Unicamp, agrade¸co a Eltermann, Teo Wey, Gaiowsky, Birocchi
e Tolstenko.
J´
a tem sido divertido ver quais caminhos esse grupo de sobrenomes
esquisitos tem tomado e aguardo ansioso para descobrir o que ser´
a de cada um de
vocˆes no futuro!
Aos amigos da APOGEEU,
agrade¸co tamb´em pelo bom tempo que tivemos
juntos, durante esse tempo: Luiz, Raul, Edgar, Rafael.
Finalmente, um agradecimento muito especial a todos os colegas do LBiC, os
xvii
maiores respons´
aveis pelo meu crescimento e aprendizado nesse per´ıodo.
Considero
todas as conversas (s´erias e brincadeiras), os Grudes, as parcerias em disciplinas, os
conselhos e toda a convivˆencia, como um dos pontos mais altos desses ´
ultimos anos.
Agrade¸co especialmente a parceria e amizade do Saullo,
a hospitalidade e sensibil-
idade do Marcos,
o cora¸c˜
ao generoso e sincero da Rosana,
os iogurtes do bandej˜ao
do Will, as piadas sem gra¸
ca do Hamilton, a personalidade apaixonada e intensa do
Carlos, a inteligˆencia do Andr´e, a cultura do Conrado e a determina¸c˜
ao da Thalita.
Essa combina¸c˜
ao de gˆenios faz de l´
a um lugar muito ´
unico. Tamb´em quero lembrar
dos outros colegas pr´
oximos ao lab, em especial Andr´e Virg´ılio, Alan Caio e Micael,
que tamb´em se tornou ultimamente um companheiro nas madrugadas de trabalho!
Ainda na Unicamp,
agrade¸co duas pessoas que contribu´ıram sobremanera
para o desenvolvimento desse trabalho. Alan, que apesar de infelizmente n˜
ao ser con-
siderado formalmente meu co-orientador, por ainda estar desfrutando do seu per´ıodo
de doutoramento, atuou dessa forma desde o in´ıcio, de forma muito intensa, desde em
conversas iniciais sobre temas de pesquisa, at´e em revis˜
oes e orienta¸c˜oes sobre todo o
material escrito e produzido por mim. Te agrade¸
co enormemente pelo seu empenho e
apoio, que foram essenciais para o cumprimento dessas etapas. Fernando Von Zuben,
que me ensinou muito tanto como professor,
mas como exemplo de profissional
e
indiv´ıduo. Sua dedica¸c˜
ao ao trabalho e ao apoio de seus orientandos ´e inspiradora e
foi essencial para a minha caminhada nesses ´
ultimos dois anos.
Quero tamb´em agradecer minha amada esposa e companheira Rebeca. Muito
do que foi
vivido durante esse processo do mestrado foi
compartilhado com ela,
como noites mal
dormidas,
planejamentos arriscados e ambi¸c˜oes futuras,
mas nada
foi
o bastante para afast´
a-la ou diminuir seu apoio.
A sua companhia at´e aqui
me
d´
a seguran¸
ca para confiar nos pr´oximos passos,
por mais incertos que sejam,
que
tomaremos.
Por fim,
n˜ao posso deixar de agradecer a Deus,
o qual
entendo ser n˜ao s´
o
o motivador de todas as coisas,
mas tamb´em o que d´
a sentido e prop´
osito a toda
atividade. Que eu possa ter o privil´egio de continuar aprendendo e sendo influenciado
por tantas pessoas queridas, pelo resto da minha vida.

Introduction
1.1
Introduction and Motivation
Online social
networks can be interpreted as a by-product of the impressive
advancement of
information technology,
and currently experience worldwide,
fast
growing adhesion as services like Twitter and Facebook surpass the number of hun-
dreds of millions of users (HOLT, 2013). The average navigation time in such services
is also increasing and many Internet sites already contain some form of integration
with online social networks. It is difficult to quantify the influence and impact of such
services in life beyond the scope of
the Internet,
but clear effects are already per-
ceived in realms such as personal relations, cultural standards, way of life, education
and politics.
Although social
interactions have been the object of
scientific investigation
for many years already (DE SOLA POOL;
KOCHEN,
1978),
the vast amount of
data generated and stored by online networks make the present moment particularly
prone to richer and deeper studies on social
relations.
There is a great interest in
understanding the properties and effects of
the spatio-temporal
dynamics of
com-
munication and social
interaction,
from the point of view of scientific research and
innovation, both in virtual and real environments.
One special and intriguing aspect of such virtual environments is the process
in which information is generated,
broadcast and processed by network users.
It is
noticeable that meaningful
events are created and organized in such communities,
without a centralized control, as a result of an intelligent and collective orchestration
(SARCEVIC et al., 2012).
This work proposes an in-depth study of the spatio-temporal
phenomena of
information diffusion and collective mobilization. An effort will be made to identify,
model
and characterize such events,
in order to build models able to describe their
2

Introduction
operation.
Thus,
an understanding of
the mechanisms behind those processes and
the factors and entities responsible for determining the nature of observable events
will be pursued.
The understanding of such emerging phenomena is of common interest to a
vast range of research areas. In telecommunications, for example, multi-user network
communications is a theme with many open questions, and an ever-growing demand
for novel techniques and knowledge paradigms (GAMAL et al., 2011). The spreading
of new beliefs and influence networks are of interest to social psychology, publicity, or
even politics (HALU et al., 2013; WATTS; DODDS, 2007). Decentralized and parallel
processing, in computer sciences, can also benefit from a better understanding of such
social phenomena, that could serve as a theoretical and inspirational background for
the development of application tools (GODOY;
VON ZUBEN,
2013;
MITCHELL,
2009).
Also,
the intended contribution of
this work may have a great innovative
impact in different applications. The automatic verification of rumors that are being
spread,
for example,
could be of
interest to people and authorities that are in a
position to provide timely answers to new facts.
It can also be used to verify the
veracity of content published in news sources, or even provide feedback and help in
predicting the reaction of individuals to the introduction of a new product, that can
be of strategic use to public policies or business operations.
1.2
Main Goal
of the Research
From the observation of real processes in online social networks, this work aims
to develop mathematical
and computer models with a potential
to identify,
predict
and analyse behaviour patterns, using network structure information. The focus is on
the investigation of how information disseminated and processed throughout social
networks.

Structure of the Text
This work is organized in two main parts:
first,
the introduction of the the-
oretical
background to the study of online social
networks (Chapters 2 and 3) and
then the presentation of practical experiments and empirical investigation (Chapters
4 to 7.
Chapter 2 will describe the existing studies, under a computational perspec-
tive, that have online social networks as objective of study. As the amount of work
is considerable, a taxonomy is suggested, to classify the diverse branches of research.
The present work is then situated and detailed within the proposed taxonomy.
Chapter 3 presents what will
be our theoretical
framework,
to describe and
understand social networks: the complex systems theory. This theory is fundamental
for our work,
because it put forward a comprehensive perspective to explain global
phenomena present in the network, and also a series of mathematical elements, based
on graph theory, that can be used to study the network’s structure and its behaviour.
Chapter 4 describes the experiments proposed and the details of the method-
ology that is used on them.
Also,
the choice of a specific social
networking service,
for data extraction, is properly justified.
Chapters 5, 6 and 7 deal with experimental data. First, Chapter 5 describes
the database collected, with all its properties and peculiarities.
Subsequently, on Chapter 6, a set of experiments are performed, in order to
investigate relationships between the network behaviour and properties of the content
being spread on it.
A classifier capable of
predicting a message’s subject from the
users behaviour is built.
Chapter 7 proposes another set of experiments, investigating if there is a rela-
tionship between social structures and behaviour. To verify the hypothesis, message
sharing patterns for different groups of users are analysed.
Finally, Chapter 8 outlines the final remarks and also is devoted to a personal
viewpoint of the intended contribution of the research.

Online Social
Network Analysis
This chapter is intended to be a concise version of the survey in Kurka et al.
(2015).
One of the most revolutionary aspects of the Internet is,
on top of the pos-
sibility of connecting computers from the entire world, the power to connect people
and cultures. More and more the Internet is used for the development of Online So-
cial Networks (OSNs) – an adaptation of social organizations to the “virtual world”.
Currently,
OSNs such as Twitter
1
,
Google+
2
and Facebook
3
have hundreds of
mil-
lions of users (AJMERA, 2014). Futhermore, the average browsing time inside those
services is increasing (BENEVENUTO et al., 2009) and many websites are featuring
some sort of integration with social networking services. Although the effects of such
services on personal interactions, cultural and living standards, education and poli-
tics are visible, understanding the whole extent of the influence and impact of those
services is a challenging task.
The study of social
networks is not something new.
Since the emergence of
the first human societies,
social
networks have been there forging individual
and
collective behaviour.
In the academia,
research on social
networks can be traced to
the first decades of
the twentieth century (RICE,
1927),
while probably the most
influential
early work on social
network analysis was the seminal
paper “Contacts
and Influence” (DE SOLA POOL; KOCHEN, 1978), written in the 1950’s
4
.
In recent years, however, with the popularization of OSNs, this research sub-
ject gained new momentum as novel
possibilities of
study have arisen and plenty
of data on social relations and interactions have become available. Even though the

Despite being formally published only in 1978,
early versions of
this paper circulated among
scholars since it was written.
These early versions had strong impact on many researchers,
including Stanley Milgram in his paper about the small-world phenomenon.

Chapter 2.
Online Social

most popular OSNs have barely ten years of
existence – Facebook was founded in
2004,
Twitter in 2006 and Myspace
5
in 2003 –,
the volume of
scientific work hav-
ing them as subject is considerable.
Finding order and sense among all
the work
produced is becoming a huge task,
specially for new researchers,
as the amount of
produced material accumulates.
2.1
Online Social
Networks as Object of Study
2.1.1
What Attracts Scientists to Study Online Social
Networks?
The degree of attention that the media and general public give to OSNs can
be a good motivation for the research in this field.
However,
from a computational
perspective,
OSNs present some particularities that must be taken into account,
in
order to understand the researchers interests. The main reasons are listed below:
Data availability:
Every day, a huge amount of information travels through OSNs
and much of it is freely available for researchers
6
.
This abundant data is un-
precedented in the study of social
systems and serves as a base for computa-
tional analysis and scientific work. Due to its abundance, social data can fit in
the context of Big Data research.
Multiple authorship:
Differently from other
corpora,
the textual
content
pro-
duced in OSNs has different authorial
sources.
This enhances the data col-
lected, which present various styles, forms, contexts and expression strategies.
Thereby, OSNs can be a rich repository of text for natural language processing
applications.
Agent interaction:
Every individual that composes such networks is an agent able
to take decisions and interact with other agents.
This complex interactions
dynamics produces effects that puzzle and interest several researchers.

Networks as Object of Study

Temporal dynamics:
The fact that social
data is generated continuously along
time allows analysis that take into account processes and transformations,
as
topic evolution or collective mobilizations.
Instantaneity:
Besides the continuous generation, the social data is also provided
at every moment, instantaneously. Thus, OSNs typically reacts in real time to
both internal and external stimuli.
Ubiquity:
Following the technological development, which increases people’s access
to means of
communication and information (as smartphones and tablets),
OSNs content can be generated,
virtually,
from anywhere at anytime.
Also,
data’s geolocation,
a feature present in many OSNs,
adds new possibilities to
the analysis.
2.1.2
Which Networks are Explored?
Two main characteristics can be taken into consideration,
before choosing a
network to study: popularity (number of active users) and how easy is the access to
its data.
Currently, the largest online social network is Facebook, with over one billion
active users (FACEBOOK, 2014). Although the use of data extracted from Facebook
is present in literature (DOW; FRIGGERI, 2013; KUMAR, 2012; SUN et al., 2009),
the high proportion of protected content – generally due to users privacy settings –
severely restricts the analysis using this OSN as a source.
Twitter, a popular microblogging tool (CHEONG; RAY, 2011), can be consid-
ered by far the most studied OSN (ROGERS, 2013). The existence of a well-defined
public interface for software developers
7
to extract data from the network, the sim-
plicity of
its protocol
8
and the public nature of
most of
its content can be a good
explanation for that.
However,
some time after the beginning of
the service,
rate

In Twitter,
users can post only up to 140 characters text messages,
unlike Facebook,
where
users can send photos, videos and large text messages.

Chapter 2.
Online Social
Network Analysis
policies have been created to control the amount of data allowed to be collected by
researchers and analysts. This had a direct impact on research, as initial works had
access to all
the content published in the network,
while today’s works are usually
limited by those policies (ROGERS, 2013).
It is also worth mentioning the existence of Chinese counterpart services for
Facebook and Twitter, like Sina-Weibo
9
, the largest one, with more than 500 million
registered users (ONG,
2013).
Although the usage of those services may differ due
to cultural
aspects (ASUR et al.,
2011;
GAO et al.,
2012),
similar lines of inquires
can be developed in both the Western and Eastern equivalents.
Examples:
Guo et
al. (2011), Qu et al. (2011), Yang et al. (2012) and Bao et al. (2013).
Other web services that integrate social
networking features have been the
focus of
study.
Examples are media sites like YouTube
10
(MISLOVE et
al.,
2007)
and Flickr
11
(CHA et al.,
2009;
KUMAR et al.,
2010),
and news services as Digg
12
(HOGG; LERMAN, 2009; WU; HUBERMAN, 2007). Research was also made with
implicit social networks as email users (TYLER et al., 2005), university pages (ADAMIC;
ADAR,
2003;
ADAMIC;
ADAR,
2005) or blogs (GRUHL et al.,
2004),
even before
the creation of social networking services.
2.2
Categories of Study
In order to simplify the presentation of the wide range of works devoted to the
analysis of Online Social Networks, from a computational perspective, a categoriza-
tion of the areas of research is needed. Here we will propose a taxonomy that covers
different aspects of
this research,
structuring all
the surveyed works in three main
groups:
(1) structural
analysis,
(2) social
data analysis,
and (3) social
interaction
analysis. Fig. 1 illustrates this proposed structure, with its respective subdivisions.

2.2.1
Structural
Analysis
Under structural analysis are works that have OSNs structure and operation
as objects of study.
Many can be the reasons why researchers are interested in the
study of a network:
to understand how it is composed,
to compare its structure to
other known networks (specially with offline social networks) or to create models of
social organization.
From the end of
the last century,
studies showed that many real
networks
have some non-trivial
properties,
such as small
average distances between nodes
(WATTS; STROGATZ, 1998) and number of connections per node following a power-
law (BARAB´
aSI, 1999), culminating in the rise of a new area of study named complex
networks or network science (MITCHELL,
2009).
Such networks can be found on
many areas (COSTA et al.,
2007a),
from computer systems to protein interactions
and, of course, in social networks. The creation of OSNs and the availability of data,
thus, are leveraging this emergent study of complex attributes of OSNs.

2.2.2
Social
Data Analysis
The focus of social
data analysis is essentially the content that is being pro-
duced by users. The data produced is the most important aspect considered, making
other features like the social connections secondary.
Although works
belonging to this
category can be conducted with other
datasets (even datasets without social
characteristics),
the data produced in social
networks are rich,
diverse and abundant,
which makes them a relevant source for
data science.
Most of
the computational
researches that employ social
data use it
in machine learning problems such as natural language processing (NLP), classifica-
tion and prediction.
In addition to the challenge of
building robust algorithms for
such purposes, researchers have also the challenge of building scalable computational
solutions that can deal with the large amount of data available in those services.
2.2.3
Social
Interaction Analysis
Works on social interaction analysis tend to focus primarily on how users are
connected (by observing its social connections) and how the data produced by users
relate to the network’s structure.
By watching users diffusing content, there is the expectation of knowing more
about complex human behaviour.
The access to data produced by OSNs and the
knowledge of
how to process and analyse them are enabling computer scientists
to join discussions previously exclusive to sociologists or psychologists.
This new
intersection of fields is known as computational
social
science (LAZER et al., 2009;
CIOFFI-REVILLA, 2010; CONTE et al., 2012).
There are still questionings related to whether the behaviour observed in an
OSN can be extrapolated to its users offline lives and whether OSN users are repre-
sentative enough for drawing conclusions,
from their behaviour,
for whole societies
(BOYD,
2010).
Even so,
there is a plenty of
phenomena that take place on OSNs
that are worth to be studied.

Phenomena

2.3
Analysis of Spatio-Temporal
Phenomena
Many aspects of social behaviour have been interesting for researchers. Studies
intended to predict public opinion (ASUR; HUBERMAN, 2010; GRUHL et al., 2005;
TUMASJAN et al., 2010), analyse collective sentiment (LANSDALL-WELFARE et
al., 2012; STIEGLITZ; DANG-XUAN, 2012) and investigate the formation of struc-
tures (BOLLEN et al.,
2011;
KWAK et al.,
2010) are some examples.
However,
as
already mentioned in Section 1.2, the focus of the present work is on the investigation
of how information is disseminated and processed throughout social networks.
Those events can be characterized as spatio-temporal
phenomena.
As OSNs
are distributed systems,
both spatial
aspects (such as the network topology) and
temporal (such as speed or synchrony) should be considered in order to observe and
study information diffusion processes.
14
Extensive research has been carried out in order to model
the propagation
of
information in OSNs (BORGE-HOLTHOEFER et
al.,
2013).
Models originally
used in other fields such as medicine,
biology and physics,
can be used to describe
this effect (DRAIEF; MASSOULI, 2010). However, given the inherent complexity of
the various factors that govern this phenomenon,
there is still
much research to be
developed and implemented, what gives space and relevance to the present work.
Attempts to predict the spread of messages in networks have also been made,
however with little success (CHEN et al., 2010; LEE et al., 2014). Prediction normally
considers three factors (AARTS et
al.,
2012),
not necessarily simultaneously:
the
message (content) propagated (e.g.
Romero et
al.
(2011));
properties of
the users
involved in the diffusion (e.g. Borge-Holthoefer et al. (2012), Suh et al. (2010)); and
network structures in which content is diffused (e.g.
Ardon et al. (2013),
Lerman e
Ghosh (2010)).
Research has also been done investigating the power of influence of individual
14
The term “spatio-temporal” might be used in a more restrict sense, referring to networks where
the physical location of its users along the time is accessible and relevant (see Shekhar e Oliver
(2010) and De Longueville et al. (2009), for example. This work, however, opts to use the term
in a wider sense, as explained in the paragraph.
12

users (BORGE-HOLTHOEFER et al.,
2012;
CHA et al.,
2010) and characterizing
different patterns in the dissemination of
false and true topics (CASTILLO et al.,
2011; TRIPATHY et al., 2010).
2.3.1
Self-organization in networks
Another interesting aspect of social networks is the presence of self-organization.
Even without a central
control,
connected individuals are able,
in certain circum-
stances,
to organize and act globally.
Collective information diffusion processes are
examples of this, since many elements of a network work together (sharing informa-
tion), producing global effects (the dissemination and popularization of information).
However,
other self-organizing processes are present and observable.
An ex-
ample is the network mobilization during crisis events such as social
revolutions
(GONZALEZ-BAILON et al., 2013; STARBIRD; PALEN, 2012) or natural disasters
(VIEWEG et al.,
2010).
An impressive level
of coordination is detectable in emer-
gency situations where authority roles are spontaneously assigned to specific users,
by other users,
and the network is able to select relevant and useful
content in the
midst of thousands of transacted messages (SARCEVIC et al., 2012).
Another spatio-temporal phenomenon associated with self-organization is re-
lated to how the network selects and filters opinions and information. Salath´e et al.
(2013) explores the scattering dynamics and the discussion of favorable or contrary
opinions to a new vaccine.
The ways in which rumors gain or lose space on the
network is also a subject of
study by several
researchers (CASTILLO et al.,
2011;
GUPTA et al., 2012; MENDOZA et al., 2010; TRIPATHY et al., 2010).
Despite several
of the cited studies have already approached similar themes
to those that form the basis of the proposal of this research, the present study differs
from the others by proposing an extensive use of
the complex network theory to
characterize and classify the observed events of diffusion and information processing.
Although some studies use concepts of the area, there is still a stronger emphasis on
the textual content of the information being spread and not on the structure and the

propagation dynamics intrinsic to the content.

Complex Systems
Different approaches can be used, when studying a process, in order to build
explanatory models.
In this context,
reductionism has been one of
the most com-
mon paradigms, proposing the progressive division of an original problem in simpler
instances with known solutions, having the general solution as a conjugation of the
problem’s partial solutions (DESCARTES, 1637).
Many problems
assessed nowadays
by science,
however,
challenge such a
paradigm (KUHN,
1962).
Issues like weather forecasting,
the study of an economic
system,
or epidemics propagation have in common the fact that,
when partitioned
in manageable elements,
lose relevant information,
compromising the validity of
a
general solution. Non-reductionist approaches are required to explain them, as it be-
comes clear that, in some cases, “the whole can be more than the sum of the parts”
(AMARAL; OTTINO, 2004).
When studying a system from this perspective,
the relationship among the
components and how they mutually affect each other should also be explored, addi-
tionally to the emphasis on its individual features. The understanding is that, from
such mutual
relations,
the system might present a novel
(or emergent) dynamics,
which is not present in or even achievable by the individuals.
Systems that require such an special generalized approach are called complex
systems. Complex systems are present in many fields such as physics, mathematics,
biology,
and social
sciences.
Although a closed definition for the term may not be
generally accepted,
some characteristics are commonly present in all
such systems
(MITCHELL, 2009):
∙ Presence of multiple individuals with autonomy to take decisions, without the
control of a central leader. The absence of a central control does not imply that
the individual decisions are going to be independent, due to the existence of an
16
Chapter 3.
Complex Systems
intricate network of cause-effect relations.
The complexity can be understood
as a consequence of
those properties,
so as when the number of
individuals
increase,
the number of individual
decisions and the possibility of mutual
in-
terference among them also increase,
creating a virtually unpredictable,
and
many times interesting, behaviour of the system.
∙ Communication between connected individuals.
The ability to exchange in-
formation allows the occurrence of
processing in the system,
as information
and signals are able to travel
throughout the system and influence individual
decisions.
∙ Adaptation by means of
evolution or learning.
Complex systems are able to
adapt, in reaction to environmental pressure, having flexibility to survive even
under varying environmental conditions.
Therefore, the complex systems approach is very appropriate for the study of
online social networks, when observing phenomena that progress from individual to
global behaviour.
One of the sub-topics of the complex systems theory that is more adequate
to the social
network analysis is the complex network analysis,
that is the study of
network interaction structures that possess specific topological features.
3.1
Complex Networks
The study of
complex networks uses graph theory to model
and represent
structures from the real
world.
The basic components of
a network (or graph) are
vertices and edges that connect them.
On a network representation,
vertices corre-
spond to individual units, like neurons in a neural network or human beings in a social
network, and the connections correspond to their relations (synapses or friendships,
respectively, in the given examples).
3.2.

The connections tend to have a crucial role in the network’s local and global
behaviour, although the vertices may have their own properties that can be studied
and analyzed separately,
as connections allow the exchange of
material,
energy or
information between its elements.
The individual
elements of the network,
thereby,
can surpass local limitations. This is clear, for example, in human being networks: the
person’s connections can influence him or her to take decisions or acquire knowledge
that may go beyond his or her initial individual potentials (BARRETT et al., 2007;
HUTCHINS,
2000).
When the amount of individuals and connections increase,
the
complexity of the processes also increase, bringing emergent behaviours that cannot
be independently assigned to any of the individuals.

Graph Theory Definitions
A graph is defined by its constituent parts:
vertices and edges.
Therefore,
a graph 𝐺
=
{𝑉, 𝐸} can be characterized by a set of vertices 𝑉 and a set of edges
𝐸. While the vertices in 𝑉 are independent elements, the edges in 𝐸 are defined by
a pair of nodes in 𝑉 which are connected.
The components from both sets (𝑉 and 𝐸) might have attributes, depending
on the application.
For example,
a vertex might have labels and other attributes,
representing properties such as weight,
power or name.
An edge might have a real
value associated with it, representing the intensity (or cost) of a connection.
Edges can also be directed,
representing a precedence between two vertices,
thus characterizing a directed graph. When the edges represent merely a connection
between two vertices, without direction, the graph is called undirected. Directed edges
are graphically represented by arrows, and undirected edges by lines (see Figure 2.
If set 𝐸 contains more than one pair
(
𝑖, 𝑗
)
∈ 𝑉 , the repeated edges are called
multiple.
When it is possible to find a sequence of
edges in 𝐸 that connects two
vertices 𝑖 and 𝑗,
possibly passing through other vertices,
a path between 𝑖 and 𝑗 is
18
Chapter 3.
Complex Systems
defined. A path that starts and ends in a same vertex is called a cycle.
Some specific cases of graphs receive its own nomenclature:
∙ Simple graph: Graphs without cycles or multiple edges;
∙ Directed acyclic graph (DAG): Directed graph without cycles;
∙ Complete graph: A graph where the edges in 𝐸 connect all possible pair of
nodes in 𝑉 ;
∙ Connected graph: A graph where for every pair of nodes
(
𝑖, 𝑗
)
there is a path
in 𝐸.
A graph can be represented in several
ways.
Graphical
representations usu-
ally describe vertices as circles or dots and edges as lines (or arrows if
directed)
connecting them.
Mathematical
representations include the definition of set 𝑉 as a
list of elements and 𝐸 as a list of vertex pairs. Another useful notation, specially used
for arithmetic operations, is the matricial notation. Examples of the use of matrices
to represent graphs include the incidence matrix,
where rows represent the graph’s
vertices and the columns the edges and the cells define if a specific vertex (row) is
present in a specific edge (column). On the adjacency matrix both rows and columns
are indexed by the vertices and each cell represent the existence of an edge connecting
the pair of vertices defined by its (row, column) position.
3.2.2
Network Metrics and Properties
Several metrics can be used to characterize a given network, represented math-
ematically by a graph with edges and vertices, 𝐺
=
{𝑉, 𝐸}. The aim of such a char-
acterization is to analyse the network’s properties and also to be able to compare
different network structures.
There are many metrics used by researchers, as shown by Costa et al. (2007b).
The ones most relevant to the present work are detailed below:

Figure 3 –
Different representations of the same graph.
Size and order:
The total
number of
edges and vertices of
a graph 𝐺 are noted
respectively |𝐸| and |𝑉 |. |𝑉 | is also called the graph’s order and |𝐸| its size.
Network’s density:
The ratio between the total number of edges |𝐸| of a network
and the maximum number of
edges defines the network’s density D.
For an
undirected network, we have:
𝐷
=
2
|𝐸|
|𝑉 |
(
|𝑉 | −
1)
Average degree:
The total
number of connections of a vertex 𝑖 is called vertex’s
degree and is denoted by 𝑘
𝑖
. In a directed network, there are two types of degree
measurements: in-degree (𝑘
𝑖𝑛
𝑖
) and out-degree (𝑘
𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑖
), defined as the amount of
edges incoming or exiting a specific vertex. A general degree measurement can
be defined, in directed networks, as 𝑘
𝑖
=
𝑘
𝑖𝑛
𝑖
+
𝑘
𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑖
.
This index is relevant,
as the vertices with large number of
connections are
denominated hubs and are major intermediaries in the flow of activity or infor-
mation of a network (MITCHELL, 2009).
It is possible to determine a network’s average degree < 𝑘 >, from the calcula-
tion of individual degrees for each vertex of a network, as:

Degree distribution:
Another useful metric, using nodes’ degree is the degree dis-
tribution, which is a histogram, counting the number of vertices in the network
for each degree 𝑘. When the histogram is normalized by the number of vertices
|𝑉 |, a probability density function (PDF) can be derived, giving the probability
𝑃
(
𝑘
)
of a random node have degree 𝑘.
Distance metrics:
A path’s length is defined by the number of
edges in a path
connecting two vertices. The length of the shortest path (or paths) connecting
two vertices 𝑖 and 𝑗 is called geodesic distance (𝑑
𝑖,𝑗
).
If
there are not paths
connecting 𝑖 and 𝑗, the geodesic distance is defined as 𝑑
𝑖,𝑗
=
∞.
After computing the geodesic distance between all possible pairs of nodes in a
network, two relevant metrics are found:
∙ Average distance

|𝑉 |
(
|𝑉 | −

∑︁

∙ Network diameter: The longest geodesic distance found in the network.
Distance metrics are useful
for measuring,
in average,
the number of steps it
takes to move from one member of the network to another.
Clustering coefficient:
a network’s cluster is defined by highly connected groups
of
vertices.
To quantify how clustered is a vertex or a network,
a clustering
coefficient is defined.
An evidence of a cluster is the occurrence of “triangles”
2
When the network is not connected,
some geodesic distances are equal
to ∞ and the average
distance diverge. Alternatives to avoid this case is to consider only the distance of pairs belonging
to the same connected component, or the use of a related measurement, as the harmonic mean
proposed by Marchiori e Latora (2000), defined as:

– a cycle of three vertices, fully connected. Therefore, for a single vertex 𝑖, its
clustering coefficient is calculated as:
𝐶
𝑖

𝑁
Δ

)
𝑁

(

)
Where 𝑁
Δ
(

is the number of

and 𝑁

(

is the
number of pairs of nodes connected to 𝑖.
If 𝑙

is the number of edges between any pair of neighbours of node 𝑖,
and 𝑘

,
the degree of node 𝑖 (i.e. its number of neighbours), 𝐶

∙ The total number of triangles in the network (𝑁

Node centrality:
The position of a node in a network can interfere on its access to
information and its participation on events that take place on the network.
Node centrality metrics measure the importance of
a vertex in the network.
There are several metrics currently used. One of them is the already mentioned
node’s degree.
Other possible metrics is the betweenness centrality, that measures a node’s cen-
trality by how often it appears in paths connecting occasional pairs of vertices.
Quantitatively it can be defined as:
𝑏
𝑖
=
∑︁
𝑗,𝑘
𝜎
(
𝑗, 𝑖, 𝑘
)
𝜎
(
𝑗, 𝑘
)
3.3.
Special

23
where 𝜎
(
𝑗, 𝑖, 𝑘
)
is the number of shortest paths between vertices 𝑗 and 𝑘 that
passes through vertex 𝑖 and 𝜎
(
𝑗, 𝑘
)
is the number of shortest paths between 𝑗
and 𝑘, without restrictions.
Finally, another example of metric is the eigenvector centrality, that in order to
measure a node’s centrality, consider not only its degree, but also the degree of
its neighbors. Therefore, a node connected to high degree nodes is considered
more central than another node connected to the same amount of neighbors, but
with smaller degrees.
An adaptation of this metric was used and popularized
by the search engine Google, in the PageRank algorithm (PAGE et al., 1998).

History of Developments
The consolidation of
complex networks as a field of
study is a recent issue.
Until a few years ago, due to the lack of technological resources and theoretical tools,
network relations that were present in the real world were considered as the result of
chance.
An early network formation model that captures this concept is the one pro-
posed by Erd
¨
os and R´enyi (ERD
¨
oS; R´eNYI, 1959), where networks are modeled from
random graphs.
In their model,
total
number of vertices in the network is first de-
fined. Then, edges are randomly placed connecting the initial vertices. Therefore, any
network with a given number of individuals and connections have the same chance
of being generated.
The development of more powerful computers and the greater availability of
data for analysis increased the knowledge on real
networks.
However,
when those
empirical networks were analysed, it was shown that Erd
¨
os–R´enyi model was not a
proper solution to reproduce the behaviour of the observed networks.
Real networks presented nontrivial properties that were not part of the purely
random or regular models. By the end of the twenty century, studies that indicated
24
Chapter 3.
Complex Systems
some of those peculiarities gave great impulse to the research on complex networks.
Three relevant discoveries can be highlighted and will
be detailed in the follow-
ing sections:
small-world property (WATTS;
STROGATZ,
1998),
scale-free models
(BARAB´
aSI, 1999) and the identification of community structures (GIRVAN; NEW-
MAN, 2002).
3.3.2
Power Law Degree Distribution
A simple way to characterize a network is through the analysis of its degree
distribution, 𝑃
(
𝑘
)
. In a random network, like in Erd
¨
os-R´enyi model (ERD
¨
oS; R´eNYI,
1959), it is expected a normal distribution of degrees, where the majority of vertices
have degree near the average < 𝑘 > and as the degree deviates from the mean (above
or below it), less vertices are found.
The observation of several
real
networks,
however,
showed that typical
net-
work’s degree distributions generally followed a power-law,
of
form 𝑃
(
𝑘
)
∝ 𝑘
−𝛾
,
where 𝛾 is a positive constant (BARAB´
aSI, 1999). In this distribution, most of the
network’s vertices have small degrees, while few vertices have high degrees of connec-
tivity. Also, on fat tail distribution (that is the case for power-law) more and bigger
hubs are present than on Gaussian networks.
As the power-law distributions are invariant to scale changes, networks with
this property are also commonly called scale-free networks.
The scale-free networks
present some remarkable properties (MITCHELL, 2009):
∙ The presence of a relatively low number of vertices acting as hubs, concentrating
a large number of connections. The analysis of the information flow on networks
show that those hubs are more likely to have contact with relevant information
and also greater capacity to disseminate information;
∙ Heterogeneity on degree values:
the vertices of the network have degrees that
cover a wide range of values,
presenting diversity on individual
vertex’s roles
and “influence”;
3.3.
Special
Properties of Complex Networks
25
∙ Self-similarity:
parts of
the network have similar properties to the complete
network. This feature is also characteristic of fractal structures;
∙ Resilience:
even with the removal
of
random vertices,
there is a tendency to
the network’s original
connectivity properties be preserved (unless in the un-
likely case where the vertices removed are high degree nodes). This implies the
network ability to maintain its operation,
even with a significant removal
of
vertices.
Previous studies (BARAB´
aSI, 1999) show that social networks generally have
power-law degree distribution.
Intuitively,
the idea is plausible when analysing so-
ciety: while few have a great number of relationships (corresponding to a high con-
nection degree), most part of people have a relatively low number of relations. And,
in a new social
environment,
the chance of
an individual
knowing another already
“popular” person, with many connections, is higher than the chance of knowing peo-
ple with less connections,
isolated (maintaining then the scale-free structure of the
network).
3.3.3
Small
World Effect
One of the most noted properties observed on real networks is the small world
effect.
The name refers to Stanley Milgram’s work (MILGRAM, 1967), who analysed
how people were connected in society and the possibility of finding short paths be-
tween individuals. From the beginning of the twentieth century, there was a popular
conjecture stating that it was possible to connect any two persons by means of an
average of five intermediates, also known as “six degrees of separation” (KARINTHY,
1929).
In order to empirically validate this notion of
proximity in society,
Stanley
Milgram proposed an experiment where a group of people living in midwest United
States received instructions to deliver a letter to a target person living in Boston,
26
Chapter 3.
Complex Systems
Massachusetts (considered far both geographically and economically).
The instruc-
tions given to the first recipients of the letter were to either: (a) send the letter directly
to the target, if they knew the target personally, or (b) chose a known person that,
in their opinion, were more likely to know the target.
The paths took by the letters were registered and analyzed. From the letters
that reached their recipient (there were many cases where people refused to keep the
experiment, breaking the chain), it was possible to calculate a number between five
and six as the average path length, showing evidences of the “small-world” effect.
Years later, in 1998, Duncan J. Watts and Steven Strogatz (WATTS; STRO-
GATZ, 1998) could generalize Milgram’s result, by analysing other real networks and
finding two non-trivial properties: small network diameter and high clustering. From
the observation, a generative model was also proposed.
It was verified that real networks have a smaller diameter than purely random
networks (BOLLOB´
aS;
RIORDAN,
2004).
This implies that vertices on a complex
network can find relatively small
paths between each other.
This result allows that
disturbances on the network be propagated very fast.
This can help to explain the
speed and the spatial patterns with which rumors and epidemics spread in society.
The presence of highly connected groups is common in complex networks, such
as social
networks,
forming clusters.
The clustering coefficient in random networks
is inversely related to the number of
vertices on the network,
so that the increase
of vertices tends to separate groups and increase the network’s sparsity.
On small-
world networks,
however,
it was observed that the clustering coefficient 𝐶 remains
constant, independently of the number of vertices. Large and complex networks thus
tend to have a much higher clustering coefficient than random networks.
Another common feature of
social
networks,
besides clustering,
is the pres-
ence of
communities.
Communities are characterized by groups of
vertices highly
connected among them, but poorly connected externally to other groups. This effect
is also intuitively true for social networks, as it is common the identification of con-
cise groups (joined by affinity, age, social aspects, regional proximity, etc), with the
3.3.
Special
Properties of Complex Networks
27
described properties.
In terms of information flow, groups with highly connected vertices may imply
a redundancy of communication channels, possibly enhancing information that pass
through or are generated by these groups.
In the case of
online social
networks,
it
can imply that content introduced on those clusters is proliferated and reinforced.
It is expected also a community influence on how its members receive and judge
information.
3.3.4
Relation between structure and function
Another aspect in what complex networks differ from general or random net-
works is in the presence of adaptive structures.
It is possible to observe recurrent patterns of connections among vertices in
real networks, called motifs (SHEN-ORR et al., 2002). From the theoretical analysis
of random networks, it is possible to statistically predict the chance that pattern of
connected vertices (sub-graphs) appears in networks with characteristics – like degree
distribution – similar to those of real
networks.
However,
it is empirically observed
on real
networks that some sub-graphs appear in a much higher frequency than
expected,
defining thus a motif.
Figure 4 presents some common motifs examples,
found on known networks.
This high frequency may indicate that specific functions of the network are
being assigned to these groups of
vertices (MILO et
al.,
2002).
Evidence of
this
phenomena can be seen, for example, in information processing networks like neural
networks and gene transcription networks,
where feed-forward loops (see Figure 4)
act as filters, generating pulse and response accelerators (ZASLAVER et al., 2004).
A relationship between the topological
structure of
a network and the be-
haviour of its components can also be often noticed. In most cases it is not possible
to determine which is the cause and which is the consequence (i.e., if the topology is
a result of individual behaviour, or if the behaviour is a consequence of the topology),
but the study of one can generally help understanding the other.

(2007b)
Researchers identified, in general social networks, a tendency that users with
common interests are usually connected to each other (MCPHERSON et al., 2001).
Such phenomenon is called homophily and is also verified on Online Social Networks.
For example, Bollen et al. (2011) verified, by investigating the relationship between
emotions and social
connections,
that users considered happy tend to be linked to
each other.
3.4
Social
Networks as Complex Systems
Now we return to our main object of study – Online Social
Networks – and
their relation to complex systems.
The aim is to determine in which sense social
networks can be considered complex and how can social systems be modeled in this
framework.
3.4.
Social
Networks as Complex Systems

3.4.1
Modeling Social
Networks
An immediate approach,
when modeling social
systems as networks,
is to
consider each individual
as a vertex and its social
connections as edges.
This rep-
resentation suitably models most online social
networking services available,
where
each person has a user profile and is able to connect to other people, as their friends
or followers.
Attributes can be used to specify characteristics from both users and connec-
tions. For example, each vertex of a social network model may have associated with
it a profile with personal information about the user it represents and groups of inter-
est he or she shares with other users of the network. Edges can also have attributes,
modeling aspects such as “relationship intensity” or geographical distance.
From the network’s structure,
it is possible to infer some relevant aspects
about the individuals, such as presence of communities, preferred relationships and
paths of
communication,
and information’s flow.
Issues like influence,
relationship
building and collective movements can also be noticed, if analysed over time.
3.4.2
Multiples Networks in a Network
Different ways of modeling the system are also possible and can bring different
perspectives to the analysis. Some alternatives are highlighted:
∙ Instead of modeling the network’s edges using the “declared” list of relationships
on users profiles, it is possible to infer connections from user’s interactions. This
implicit network can reveal
interesting aspects about user’s relationships and
serves as an alternative for a more reliable social analysis.
∙ Characterizing vertices as group of users, instead of individual users. This would
favour the analysis of groups interaction and collective dynamics.
∙ It is common that a group of individuals belongs to more than one network,
in different contexts.
For example,
the same group of
people might have ac-
counts in a friendship social
network (e.g.
Facebook),
a professional
network
30
Chapter 3.
Complex Systems
(e.g. Linkedin) and a news social network (e.g. Digg). The overlap of all those
network structures can create a multiplex network
(GOMEZ-GARDENES
et
al.,
2012;
G
´
OMEZ et
al.,
2013;
MUCHA et
al.,
2010;
SUN;
HAN,
2012),
allowing new discoveries.
∙ Inclusion into the model
of
different objects as vertices,
alongside the users
(SUN;
HAN,
2012;
BARBOSA et al.,
2015).
For example,
in a movies social
network,
vertices could represent either users or movies.
Thus,
connections
between movies and users would represent movies previously watched and con-
nections between users would indicate friendships.
3.4.3
Complex Behaviour
Complex systems and complex network theory provide a general
framework
for working with many different systems,
in different areas,
as seen in the sections
above.
The same graph structure can be used,
for example,
to represent the inter-
action of proteins in an organism, atmospheric agents in weather forecasting, pages
and hyperlinks on the Internet or even a country’s electrical distribution system.
The same theory applied to human relationships, however, seems to be con-
troversial when reducing a whole person, with all its uniqueness, to a simple and ho-
mogeneous vertex in the network. It is interesting to notice that one of the premises
of complex systems is that the complexity does not come from the individual agents
alone,
but from the collective experience and the multiplicity of
actions and their
intertwined effect.
Thus,
although each individual
of
the system can be seen as a
whole “complex system”, this is not the complexity sought in this work.
This tension between the power of the individual behaviour versus the influ-
ence of an emergent force, created by the collectivity, is a topic of author’s interest,
and this study intends to bring questions and initial answers to this topic.
What is the capacity of
an individual
to resist the influences of
his or her
environment and keep an opinion or a behaviour? Is it possible to characterize indi-
3.4.
Social
Networks as Complex Systems
31
viduals by characterizing a system? To whom does the values and beliefs propagated
over the network correspond?
Those are questions that certainly will
not be totally answered in the scope
of the present work, but they will guide the investigation behind the experiments of
the next chapters.

Experiments and Methodology
In the following chapters and sections, experiments conducted in order to val-
idate and propose new perspectives to Online Social Network analysis are presented.
Real data, extracted from social networking services, were used and a methodology
of experimentation was developed to validate the hypothesis.
This chapter present details of the proposed methodology and the key deci-
sions taken to accomplish practical results.
4.1
Questions to Be Answered
There is a general question that permeates the experiments described in the
following chapters:
Main question. Is it possible to explain individuals behaviour, from external obser-
vations of the topology and collective behaviour?
In order to seek possible answers to this question, two lines of experimentation
were conducted, each addressing a different aspect:
∙ Experiments set I: Investigation of information diffusion’s properties, in order
to find patterns and predict features of the content being transmited over the
network (Chapter 6);
∙ Experiments set II: A study of the interplay that social connections may have
on users’ behaviour over the network (Chapter 7).
Each set of
experiments has also a fundamental
question and a practical
question that guide the process of
analysis.
The fundamental
question considers
philosophical implications behind the proposed experiments. The practical question
34
Chapter 4.
Experiments and Methodology
presents a formulation of the fundamental question with terms that can be concretely
answered by computational experiments and techniques.
Thus, from the direct computational experiments, it is expected that hints of
the fundamental and practical questions can be revealed and explored.
4.2
Choosing a Social
Networking Service
In order to analyse real data, a social networking service had to be chosen. A
service that provided significant amount of data, diverse and generic enough to allow
the formulation of general theories and suitable to different contexts and observations
was aimed. After evaluating possibilities, the choice was made for the microblogging
service Twitter
1
.
In this service,
individual
users can own accounts and are able to associate
their accounts to others users accounts (following, or being followed by other users).
Each user can also publish texts up to 140 characters named tweets,
accessible and
visible to all
their “followers”,
see Figure 5.
The service also provides an interface
where each user can see a timeline that contains a list of the content posted by all
the users they follow, in chronological order.
A tweet
can be an original message authored by a user, or it can be a repli-
cation of
another message previously created by another user.
The latter case is a
popular practice on the network and is called retweet. A retweet can be identified by
a message prefix composed of the letters “RT”.
Currently,
the process of retwitting
can be done manually (by copying the original message’s text and publishing a new
message, prefixed by “RT”) or via the official service’s interface, that provides a quick
button to reshare a specific message with the user’s followers.
Another popular convention, created initially by the users, but later officialy
adopted by the service, is the use of hashtag on tweets, with the purpose of labeling
a message (“folksonomy”).
A hashtag consists in a string of characters (generally a

Networking Service

word or a small phrase without spaces), prefixed by the hash (‘#’) character.
The presence of retweets and hashtags is very helpful,
as it allows the easy
identification of
information cascades throughout the network,
by analysing users
retweeting the same message, and the formation of topics, by analysing the hashtags
used to describe a group of messages.
Also,
Twitter
presents other beneficial
features that justify its choice as a
database:
∙ There is a clear representation of the individuals (users) and their relationships
(followers and followees), allowing the characterization of a network;
∙ There is a regular way of interactions between the users: short messages with
140 characters;
∙ The information that travels throughout the network is easily treatable, since
36
Chapter 4.
Experiments and Methodology
it is restricted to textual content
2
;
∙ There is a great amount of public data available, produced by users;
∙ The existence of APIs enables the access and manipulation of data;
∙ Literature in the extraction of data in virtual
networks using Twitter is con-
solidated.
The App Programing Interface (API) provided by Twitter
3
was used to
obtain data. Two different interfaces were used: (a) the Rest API, to make requests
on Twitter’s database, extracting data regarding users profiles and their relationships
in the network,
and (b) the Stream API,
to filter in real
time public messages of
interest. Both APIs have limits for the allowed requests. It was possible, however, to
extract enough data for the research conducted here obeying the limits.

4.3.1
Data Acquisition and Modeling
The APIs described above were used to extract data from the Twitter ser-
vice to build models of
information diffusion,
that could be further analysed and
interpreted.
One restriction imposed by the API’s rate limits is that the number of requests
to get messages posted on the past is significantly low, making significantly difficult
the analysis of already documented diffusions. The alternative found was to use the
Stream API, that allows the extraction of a vast quantity
4
of messages that are being
transmitted in real-time on the service.

Although recent changes on the official service interface (<https://twitter.com/>) interpret the
content of urls on messages, highlighting the presence of references to photos or videos.

The Stream API allows the extraction of up to 1% of all the messages published on the service,
during its use.
Considering that Twitter is a global
service,
this limit is,
in practice,
quite
permissive, allowing the extraction of full cuts of the network’s activity.
4.3.
Methodological
Framework
37
Although the amount of
data extracted was not an issue when using the
Stream API,
the necessity of
using real-time data imposes restrictions on the dif-
fusions that can be analyzed.
The main challenge was to determine a priori
the
diffusion processes that are going to happen in the near future and how and where a
diffusion process will begin, in order to collect its information.
The solution found was to focus the analysis on diffusions processes created
and started by popular users on the network.
Popular Twitter users,
having many
followers, are able to start cascade of messages (through retweets), from the content
posted by them (tweets). Therefore, by filtering messages authored by famous users
(such as actors,
personalities,
public figures or news agencies) and their shares,
it
was possible to witness in real-time several
processes of information diffusion with
varying sizes.
From the observation of the occurrence of such processes,
it was possible to
map the users that took part in the diffusion processes,
their relationship network
and the time instant in which the messages were sent. As a result, complex networks
could be synthesized, describing the information flow observed.
4.3.2
Analysis of Features and Interpretation
The modeled networks could then be analysed. In this stage, metrics and pa-
rameters were searched, to extract a set of properties and spatio-temporal attributes
for the database obtained. The properties observed involved general network charac-
teristics, such as average connections, size, distances and spatio-temporal dynamics.
Details of complex networks characterization can be found in Chapter 3.
Beyond the characterization of the metrics obtained from the network, it was
possible to do a qualitative analysis of the diffusion processes, analysing aspects such
as the subject of the messages that were being spread.
Finally,
using machine learning techniques (BISHOP;
NASRABADI,
2006;
MITCHELL,
1997) involving classification,
regression and data clustering,
it was
possible to discover patterns and relations in the database.

Database Description
This chapter will describe the database extracted from Twitter’s service and
used in the experiments, according to the methodology presented in Chapter 4. It will
be shown in the following sections that the data collected presents a rich collection
of social activity, enabling the study of complex networks with thousands of vertices
and edges.
5.1
Data Extraction and Selection
A source of news to be monitored, Folha de S˜ao Paulo’s account
1
– a popular
Brazilian newspaper, with over three million followers, was chosen, with the purpose
of obtaining a source of diverse content, that approached different categories, having
a wide and varied group of followers.
From March 19 to September 21 of 2014, both the messages (tweets) posted
by the source,
as well
as the shares made by other users (retweets) were collected.
In addition to the messages’
metadata (such as time of posting,
locality,
language,
links, hashtags), information of the users that retweeted the messages were collected.
It was collected personal information (as name, country, account’s activity), as well
as the list of all their social connections on the network (followers and followees).
It was possible to track,
from the data collected,
a large amount of
infor-
mation diffusion processes triggered by the observed source.
For each process,
the
characterization of the users’
network behind it and the spatio-temporal
dynamics
of the information flow were registered.
During the observed period,
13463 distinct and original
messages posted by
the source account were collected.
2
From this set,
a series of
filters were applied,

Database Description
forming a more appropriate selection to the work, as described below.
∙ Filter 1 - Original set messages which had received more than 50 retweets were
selected, resulting in a group of 1487 distinct messages;
∙ Filter 2 - Messages from six main categories (“everyday news”, “sports”, “world”,
“politics”, “entertainment” and “market”) from the above set were maintained,
resulting in a group of 1021 messages;
∙ Filter 3 - Automated scripts (bots)
3
used to automatically retweet every (or
almost every) publication were removed from the database and from retweets
count (which happened in just one case).
∙ Filter 4 - As 2014 was characterized by a presidential
election in Brazil,
the
topic “poder” (power), where political news are posted, had a much higher fre-
quency of
messages than other categories.
Therefore,
random messages from
that category were removed, leaving a total of 200 messages (from its original
count of 329), resulting in a database with a more equalized category distribu-
tion.
The filtered data resulted in a collection of 890 messages (𝑀 ), of which 44571
distinct users (𝑈 ) retweeted one or more messages at some moment, with an average
of 95 retweets per message. Those data were organized in a matrix of tweets (𝑇 ) of
dimensions 𝑀 × 𝑈 , with the element 𝑇
𝑖,𝑗
made equal to
1
in case the message 𝑖 was
retweeted by user 𝑗, and
0
otherwise (see Figure 6).
From the users lists of followers and followees, it was possible to characterize
a graph (𝐺), registering the social connections between them. Among the 44571 users
that participated in the information diffusion, 645409 connecting edges were found.
The proprietor user, Folha de S˜ao Paulo, was removed from the network, so that the
interactions among the main page’s followers were the focus of analysis.
3
Users that retweeted more than 80% of the messages were considered as bots.
5.1.
Data Extraction and Selection

Figure 6 –
Graphical scheme of matrix 𝑇 .
It should be noted that the decision of using only one source of content and
the filters applied to the messages and users limited the amount of
data used in
the experiments. Although the volume of data available on online social services can
be treated as big data (KAISLER et al., 2013), the database used in this work was
intentionally restricted, enabling the application of different computational methods
on it.
5.1.1
Classifying the Tweets
Practically all
the messages published by the source are headlines of
news,
followed by a link to the newspaper’s website
4
,
with the news’
full
content.
As the
news articles on the website belong to thematic categories (newspaper’s sections), it
was possible to automatically attribute a class to each tweet, based on its thematic
category.
This procedure was carried out to all tweets and six predominant topics were
verified, among them: “everyday news”, “sports”, “world”, “politics”, “entertainment”
and “market” (in Portuguese: “cotidiano”, “esporte”, “mundo”, “pol´ıtica”, “entreten-
imento” and “mercado”,
respectively).
Those categories were used on the filtering
process (as described above) and were considered as classes on supervised machine
learning algorithms, as described in Chapter 6. Table 1 contains the user’s distribu-
4

Chapter 5.
Database Description
tion according to the number of categories shared.
Although this procedure configures a practical and reliable way to classify the
tweets,
it is possible to question the relevance of the classes.
The definition of each
topic’s class is made by the newspaper’s staff, with a specific purpose of organization
and separation. Also, news are many times categorized in a subjective way or should
be in more than one class, which is not supported by the newspaper.
Alternative classification schemes could have been explored and compared,
depending of the goal intended. Such an issue is further discussed in Chapter 6.
5.2
Database Features
The following properties could be verified from matrix 𝑇 :
Tweets distribution per user:
the average user participation,
in different pub-
lished messages,
is low.
During the observation period,
each user retweeted
in average only 2.01 messages from the source.
Figures 7a and 7b show an
histogram of
users’
posts distribution.
The linearity exhibited by Figure 7b
indicates a distribution of power law in the user’s behaviour.
Tweets distribution per message:
each message contains
an average of
95.03
retweets,
with the most popular message receiving 828 retweets.
A distribu-
tion profile is noticeable in Figures 8a and 8b.
Messages that contained less
than 50 retweets were not considered.
𝑇 density:
The total number of messages retweeted is 97033. In spite of matrix 𝑇
having dimensions
890

44571
,
its density is of
only 0.001975 (i.e.
0.19%),
indicating that it is extremely sparse.
Topics distribution:

topics categories (using
Folha de S˜ao Paulo’s classification) on the database.

Topics per user:
it was verified that users that shared posts frequently (6 or more
times) tend to share messages of diverse categories. The majority of those users
shared messages from 4 different categories,
as it can be seen in Table 1.
As
most users publish content from different categories,
there is a tendency of
diversification on the content shared per user.

Experiments Set I
-
Information Diffu-
sion Properties and Patterns
In this chapter, a series of experiments are reported, investigating the struc-
ture of information diffusion processes.
The aim is to find patterns and predictable
features that can be used to understand aspects of the processes taking place in the
network.
A fundamental question can be formulated as background to the experiments
that will be presented:
Fundamental
question 1.
Is it
possible to understand the subjective nature of
processes happening on a network, from its users behaviour?
The proposed strategy to answer this question is to use the data collected on
each sequence of tweet
and retweets observed to characterize possible relationships
between the subject of a message and it’s propagation particularities.
Therefore, the practical question that is being addressed is:
Practical question 1. Given the users that share a message, is it possible to obtain
information about the content of the message?
The content of messages are public and can be obtained directly by its text.
However,
the experiments presented aim to perceive possible relations between a
content published and its effects on the spatio-temporal
behaviour of the network.
This exploration can give insights on how different content affects people and if this
effect can be identified and generalized.
Information of all user’s behaviour towards a content can be extracted from
matrix 𝑇 , where each of the 𝑀 messages is represented by an array 𝑀
𝑖
with dimension
50
Chapter 6.
Experiments Set I - Information Diffusion Properties and Patterns
𝑈
= 44571
.
Each array 𝑀
𝑖
can be interpreted as a “signature” of
its associated
message.
Machine learning techniques of classification and clustering are used to iden-
tify possible patterns and allows a numerical
analysis.
The techniques used can be
grouped in two categories: supervised learning an unsupervised learning.
6.1
Supervised Learning
As the messages analysed can be labeled,
using the classification from the
newspaper Folha de S˜
ao Paulo, supervised machine learning algorithms are suitable
to be used with the data.
6.1.1
KNN
The first
strategy applied was the well-known classification algorithm “k-
nearest neighbours” (KNN),
where a message’s category (or class) is defined as the
category more present within the 𝑘-nearest messages (neighbors) of it.
The distance between two messages is calculated from the behaviour vectors
𝑀
𝑖
. Diverse metrics were considered to fit to the problem, where the Jaccard distance
1
was the one that produced the best results.
Different values of 𝑘 (neighbours) were tested and the performance is regis-
tered in Figure 11.
The results presented are the classifier’s accuracy for a sample
of
300 random tweets of
the database.
The obtained accuracy is an average of
30
different executions, using different samples.
As a matter of
comparison,
results from a random classifier were also gen-
erated,
creating a null
model.
Instead of
using the class of
the 𝑘-nearest message
vectors of a given vector 𝑀
𝑖
,
the random classifier considers the category more fre-
quent within 𝑘 random messages on matrix 𝑇 ,
to determine the class of
message
𝑖.

Figure 11 – Clasification results of
the KNN algorithm and of
a random classifier
(null model)
It is noticeable that, for lower values of 𝑘 (𝑘 ∈
1
,
3
), the KNN classifier shows
results way above random, with over 30% of accuracy, showing a relationship between
type of message (topic) and participants. For higher values of 𝑘, however, the results
tend to be equal to the null model.
A possible explanation to this is that each class is formed by small subclasses,
spread along the space.
Therefore,
the first few closest neighbors tend to belong to
the same class, but when 𝑘 increases, elements of other classes appear as neighbors,
undermining the classification performance.
Although there are six classes being evaluated,
the random classifier is able
to predict correctly slightly more than 16% (
1
/
6
), having an accuracy value around
20%.
This happens due to the fact that the topics are not equally distributed in
52
Chapter 6.
Experiments Set I - Information Diffusion Properties and Patterns
terms of number of messages, as Figure 9 shows.
6.1.2
Support Vector Machine
Later, a more elaborate classifier, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (LEE
et al., 2011), was used. The expectation was that, when a training set was presented
to the algorithm,
it would identify which users and behaviours were characteristic
for each class of message. Thus, when new messages are presented to the model, it is
able to identify the patterns learned on the training phase, and classify the message’s
topic.
For the training process, 80% of the dataset was used for training, producing
an input feature vector of
dimension
44571
×
712
,
and the remaining 20% were
separated for testing.
The SVM implementation used was the C-Support Vector
Classification, available on Python’s library Scikit Learn (PEDREGOSA et al., 2011).
Different kernels were tested, but the one with best results for the current task was
the linear kernel.
From 10 distinct executions of the algorithm, using different training and test
samples,
a final
accuracy of
50
.
7
±
1
.
7%
was achieved.
This result shows that the
classifier was able to identify patterns on the training dataset, making the prediction
task something feasible, for new samples presented to the model.
Table 2 depicts the confusion matrix of the classification,
showing the algo-
rithm’s performance for each class.
Classes with fewer samples (world and market )
were not classified correctly.
The most precise classification involved messages of
politics and entertainment,
with over 70% recall.
Sports messages were mistakenly
classified as everyday and entertainment,
what is not very surprising,
given the re-
semblance of these topics.
It also must be noted that the algorithm reached a rate of 100% of accuracy on
the training stage, that was not achieved within the test dataset. Attempts to increase
the model’s generalization capability were conducted,
by reducing the training set
size. However, although the accuracy of the training stage decreased, the test accuracy
6.1.
Supervised Learning
53
rate did not increased.
For comparison purposes,
a matrix 𝑇
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚
was created,
having the same
number of ones’ cells (i.e the same density and sum) of matrix 𝑇 , but with a random
distribution. The same algorithm was evaluated on 𝑇
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚
.
Interestingly, the SVM was able to find an (imaginary) pattern on the training
dataset,
also achieving 100% of accuracy on this stage.
However,
when attempting
to predict samples of the test dataset,
the model
reached
21
.
5
±
4
.
3%
of accuracy,
like the KNN’s random model.
This comparison shows that,
even though the training process may reveal
false patterns of behaviour,
hindering the learning process,
the high accuracy (over
50%) obtained in the test stage for the real
dataset is an indicator that there are
indeed observable and recurrent features on information diffusion events.

Neural
Network
Another technique tested was the use of artificial neural networks as classifiers.
As with the SVM,
neural
networks are able to build non-linear functions from the
input data (𝑀
𝑖
), in order to predict the output class.
54
Chapter 6.
Experiments Set I - Information Diffusion Properties and Patterns
The network chosen was the multilayer perceptron (MLP),
with hyperbolic
tangent as activation function and weights updated using gradient descent and back-
propagation.
The network’s had 44571 (|𝑀
𝑖
|) input entries and six (one for each
class) outputs.
The class is than defined by the output with the highest value.
668
samples (75% of the dataset) were presented to the model during the training stage.
The remaining 25% samples were used for testing.
Different network configurations were tested and was verified that few neurons
were enough to achieve 100% accuracy on the training process (indicating overfitting).
Thus,
a neural
network with only 10 neurons and one hidden layer were enough to
achieve good results.
After training, the neural network model was able to correctly classify 52.55%
of the test samples.
Figure 12 show the training and test processes. For each configuration of the
network,
obtained from the training process,
the test dataset is submitted to the
network and its accuracy evaluated. Note that after 60 epochs, the training network
could classify 100% of
the training set,
while the best model
for unseen test data
appeared on epoch 55.
Each epoch is characterized by the presentation of
all
the
training samples once.
6.2
Unsupervised Learning
As said before, the class assignment proposed by Folha de S˜
ao Paulo is only
one kind of
labeling policy.
We can conceive that there are other ways to group
messages.
For this, unsupervised clustering algorithm were used to identify new topics
from the behaviour vectors 𝑀
𝑖
. The groups indicated by the algorithms are discovered
without human intervention, by the detection of clustering patterns on the database.
6.2.
Unsupervised Learning

Figure 12 – Multilayer perceptron Neural
Network - training and test performance
along epochs.
6.2.1
K-Means
With that goal, an attempt was made to cluster messages with near behaviour
vectors (𝑀
𝑖
) and verify if there was any proximity between their topics. For that, we
used a modification of the k-means algorithm, using the function cosine as distance
metric.
Different group quantities (𝑘) were considered, but the test results were not
satisfactory.
Firstly,
when compared to the standard categories,
the obtained clus-
ters had messages with completely different standard categories (like sports and
economics together).
Besides,
in the inspection of
the obtained groups,
it was not
possible to identify clear patterns in the proposed clusters.
Table 3 presents some
examples of the result, showing five messages that are part of five different detected
56
Chapter 6.
Experiments Set I - Information Diffusion Properties and Patterns
clusters.
A possible explanation for this effect is that clusterization is a challenge over
high dimensional
spaces.
As 𝑀
𝑖
∈ ℜ
44571
,
the data is susceptible to the “curse of
dimensionality”, so that attempts to group it without a previous preprocessing stage
for dimension reduction may not be successful.
6.2.2
LDA
Another clusterization algorithm used was the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
(BLEI et al., 2003). This model, generally used on natural language processing, has
the promising feature of detecting multi classes in an unsupervised procedure.
The LDA algorithm is generally used for the task of topic detection on docu-
ments collections. The algorithm assumes that each document can be associated with
a mixture of topics and, based on the frequency of words present in each document
and its probability for each topic, returns the document’s probability distribution for
each topic. The definition of each topic is done based on the general distribution of
words (being then unsupervised),
but the number of topics sought is predefined by
the user.
An adaptation of
this algorithm was conducted,
in order to use data from
social interaction to detect the topic of the messages set 𝑀 . The tweets (messages)
were inputted in the algorithm as documents, but instead of using its words frequence
to characterize them,
each message was characterized by the users who retweeted
them.
Thus,
the LDA model
was able to detect the users most representative for
each topic and the topics distribution of each message.
The algorithm implementation used was the Python library gensim (RE-
HUREK;
SOJKA,
2010),
that offers an efficient implementation of LDA and other
topic detection algorithms.
Distribution for different number of topics were experi-
mented and the results were observed.
Table 4 presents the result for ten topics distribution.
For each topic,
the
most representative tweets (tweets that had the highest probabilities of belonging to
6.3.
Attempts of Improvement
57
each topic) are shown.
Although the topics detected with LDA seem slightly more
cohesive than the topics detected with k-means algorithm,
it still
difficult to affirm
that there is a clear separation and subject characterization on the results.
6.3
Attempts of Improvement
It is valuable to note that attempts to improve the (very noisy and sparse)
dataset were carried out,
in order to achieve better results both in the supervised
and in the unsupervised experiments.
However,
none of the attempts produced ex-
perimental improvements.
The first attempt conducted was the reduction of matrix 𝑇 ’s dimension. The
high number of
users involved in diffusions,
𝑈
= 44571
,
presented a challenge to
operations such as distance calculation, as shown in the previous sections.
A viable solution was to remove from 𝑈 users that did not participate often
in messages diffusion. Observation 1 and Figure 7 show that most users had less than
5 retweets on the observable database.
Therefore,
users with less than 5 retweets were removed from 𝑈 and subse-
quently from 𝑇 , resulting in a new matrix with only
826
users and still
890
messages.
Nevertheless, the results obtained in all experiments were worse than the ones with
the original
matrix 𝑇 ,
indicating that users with few retweets bring relevant infor-
mation about the content.
Another solution to decrease the number of users,
was to group potentially
similar users. A community detection algorithm
2
was used to identify groups of users
on the network structure 𝐺.
Members of 𝑈 could then be grouped in their respective communities and each
community corresponded to a column in 𝑇 . The value of each cell were evaluated as
the total number of retweets produced amongst the community.

Chapter 6.
Experiments Set I - Information Diffusion Properties and Patterns
The algorithm found 2001 communities (many of
them small),
reducing 𝑇
to
890
×
2001
.
However the experiments conducted with this reduced 𝑇 did not
presented satisfactory results.
Another path taken was the attempt to increase 𝑇 density,
as most of
its
values are equal to zero.
It is known that, on the observed dataset, the absense of a retweet
does not
necessarily means that a user is not interested in the message being diffused. It can
happen that a user is offline during the diffusion or even that his or her friends
already retweeted a message,
being redundant a new sharing of
the same content.
Therefore, some zeros on 𝑇 can be considered false negatives and could be replaced
by ones.
A method to infer if a user is prone to share a specific message 𝑚 was con-
ducted from the analysis of its social
connections,
represented in the graph 𝐺.
The
method consists in verifying how many followees of a user are involved in the diffu-
sion.
If message 𝑚 was retweeted by its followees,
it can be assumed that the user
has a high chance of approving the content being shared.
An exploration to infer if a user is prone to share a specific message 𝑚 was
conducted from the analysis of its social connections, represented in the graph 𝐺. If
message 𝑚 was retweeted by its followees, it can be assumed that the user has a high
chance of approving the content being shared.
Using this principle, an attempt to “propagate” a message’s retweet was per-
formed,
by filling with 1 the cells on 𝑇 belonging to direct followers of
users that
retweeted a message, thus eliminating possible false negatives.
However, this attempt was also not successful, as the results worsened, indi-
cating that this technique probably raised the false positive rate.

Results Discussion
The results presented in this chapter gives interesting answers to the questions
firstly presented in the introduction. The amount of information regarding the subject
of a message that can be obtained from observations of user behaviour is surprising.
One should note that none of the techniques presented directly analyses the textual
content of messages, being all results obtained fruit of network observation.
From the results presented above,
the supervised learning seemed to be the
most promising. It is fascinating that, even with a very sparse feature space (99,98% of
the elements of 𝑇 are zeros!), it is possible to build classifiers that predict a message’s
class over six possibilities with an accuracy rate of over 50%.
Also,
the comparison
to random models, shows that the positive obtained results are not result of chance,
but in fact product of learning.
The use of
such classifiers can be even more promising,
if
combined with
traditional
topic detection algorithms that use textual
features (natural
language
processing methods).
It is expected that the classifiers based on network features
can be able to detect features not present on the textual content, being an option to
enhance traditional classifiers, assuming they carry supplementary information.
The evaluation and analysis of
unsupervised learning results present an in-
trinsic challenge, as there are not established “correct answers” that can be used to
comparison and benchmark (as what was done to the supervised results). The analy-
sis of pertinence of messages in clusters is a subjective task and therefore debatable.
However,
even considering this subjective margin,
there were not evident results in
the analysis done.
The fact that few users that compose the dataset posted more than once
(Observation 1), and that there is small coherence on the topics published by them
(Observation 2), certainly presented a challenge to the experiments proposed. How-
ever,
attempts to mitigate it did not seem to be effective,
as described in previous
section.
It is also important to emphasize that,
due to the pioneering nature of this
60
Chapter 6.
Experiments Set I - Information Diffusion Properties and Patterns
work,
it was not possible to find alternative results on the literature,
that could be
used for comparison.
Finally,
some final
remarks can be made,
relating directly to the questions
presented at the beginning of the chapter:
Observation 4. It is possible to obtain the direction of a message category by know-
ing the users who participate in their sharing process.
Observation 5.
There is a relationship between the category (topic) of
a message
and the users that share it.

Experiments Set II
-
Influence of
Con-
nections on the Individual
Behaviour
This chapter proposes deeper investigations on the network’s structure,
in
order to find new patterns of behaviour and common properties.
The fundamental
question that can be considered as motivation for the experiments described here is
the following:
Fundamental question 2. Is it possible to determine the behaviour of an individual
from his social
connections?
We can affirm that we already have a faithful
representation of users social
connections, as it was possible to extract information of users relationship from Twit-
ter ’s service, to form graph 𝐺. Also, as done in the previous chapter, we evaluate a
user’s behaviour from the content published by him/her, in the observed database.
Therefore, to answer Question 2, we can formulate a corresponding practical
question:
Practical
question 2.
How the connections established by the users relate to the
content posted?
7.1
Community Detection
One way to select groups of individuals that may influence each other is by
detecting communities over the network.
In a community,
there is a concentration
of
connections among its members and hence an increase on the mutual
influence
between communities’ members.
In order to identify the communities present in network 𝐺, a community de-
tection algorithm (ROSVALL; BERGSTROM, 2008) was executed. Several commu-
66
Chapter 7.
Experiments Set II - Influence of Connections on the Individual
Behaviour
nities were detected, many with 2 elements (2 connected users, isolated from the rest
of the graph), but 74 larger groups with 50 users or more have also been identified.
7.1.1
Messages Frequencies
A first experiment consisted in comparing the frequency at which specific
messages were shared inside communities and in the rest of the network.
For each community with a relevant number of users (50 or more), the number
of messages retweeted for each Folha de S˜
ao Paulo’s original post was computed. A
high coherence was verified in the behaviours of individuals belonging to the same
community.
Table 5 compares the percentage of users that shared a message inside
and outside the five largest communities (in number of
users).
The percentages of
the five cases most discrepant for each community are shown, in order.
The cases shown on Table 5 indicate that there is a certain level of coordina-
tion in the selection of shared messages by each community.
It is interesting to see
how some messages are much more emphasized inside a community.
Even though
they are large communities,
Community 1 and 2,
for example,
present higher rates
of message shares than the observed on the whole network.
Equally interesting are cases where the community seems to suppress the
spread of a message, as seen in Community 4, where highly retweeted messages do not
receive the same popularity among its members, compared to its general popularity.
In order to validate this tendency of
community coordination,
experiments
were held with a randomized dataset. For this experiment, the retweet pattern of all
users were randomly permuted, while the social connections were maintained. Thus,
a user 𝑖 belonging to a community 𝑎 might now present the behavior of a user 𝑗 that
belongs to a community 𝑏.
The five messages with the most discrepant sharing rates are presented on
Table 6, for the same communities presented on Table 5. The comparison of the two
tables shows that the sharing rates of the randomized dataset are less discrepant than
the original dataset. This leads to the conclusion that there are consistent patterns

Another experiment consisted in the analysis of
how topics are distributed
among communities.
For this,
the six standard categories were considered and the
number of messages published by each community was computed.

The figures demonstrate how communities’ topic distribution may have differ-
ent profiles from the rest of the network. Community 18, for example, seems to have
a high tendence of sharing messages of entertainment and sports, while community
42 is more focused on everyday news.
7.1.2.1
TF-IDF
In order to evaluate the importance of individual
messages inside communi-
ties, a normalization procedure was applied to the database.

70
Chapter 7.
Experiments Set II - Influence of Connections on the Individual
Behaviour
is the TF-IDF (DILLON,
1983).
In this scenario,
the importance of
a document’s
words are evaluated as the product of two indexes: the frequency of the term inside
the document (TF) and the inverse of
the word’s frequency within the documents
collection (IDF).
The TF-IDF algorithm was implemented by the author. Different expressions
can be used when calculating TF and IDF and the chosen metrics used were:
𝑇 𝐹
(
𝑡, 𝑑
) =
𝑓
𝑡,𝑑
max
𝑓
𝑡,𝑑
and
𝐼𝐷𝐹
(
𝑡, 𝐷
) =
𝑁
𝑁
𝑡
therefore:
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
(
𝑡, 𝑑, 𝐷
) =
𝑇 𝐹
(
𝑡, 𝑑
)
× 𝐼𝐷𝐹
(
𝑡, 𝐷
)
where 𝑑 is a document,
𝑡 a term,
𝐷 a collection of documents,
𝑓
𝑡,𝑑
the frequencies
(counts) of term 𝑡 in document 𝑑,
max
𝑓
𝑡,𝑑
the frequency of the most frequent term
in 𝑡,
𝑁 is the number of
documents in 𝐷 and 𝑁
𝑡
the number of
documents that
contains 𝑡.
From the expressions it is evident that words that are simultaneously frequent
inside a document and uncommon in other documents receive a high score and are
considered relevant.
This technique can be adapted to the community database. Using the docu-
ments collection as analogy, if communities are considered as “documents” (therefore,
a group of communities is equivalent to a collection of documents) and tweets as the
document’s “words”,
then when TF-IDF statistic is applied to the data,
each com-
munity’s tweet receives a score related to its relevance in the characterization of that
community.
The use of this technique on the data resulted in Table 7, where the weighted
tweets can be seen for the same six communities of Figure 13. For each community,
the five tweets with highest weight are shown, together with its TF-IDF scores.
7.2.
Biclustering
71
The analysis of the message’s content of each community brings interesting
insights about its members. As seen in the data presented, not only the predominant
topics can be identified for the communities (Figure 13),
but also preferred themes
inside those topics.
For example,
community 8 seems to have a strong focus on publications re-
lated to Brazilian football team Palmeiras, community 17 specializes on pop culture
content and 30 is apparently focused on entertainment messages. It is curious that,
although the message with highest TF-IDF score of community 30 belongs to class
“mundo” (world),
its content is in fact related to entertainment.
This is one clear
evidence that messages can be categorized in different forms (see Section 5.1.1 for
more on this).
Going even further,
political
positions seem to be evident on this character-
ization.
Although the most representative messages of
communities 1 and 62 are
both about politics,
when the messages content is analysed,
the first seems to be
supportive to the current government, while the second supportive to opposition.
Evidently, this analysis of content cohesion inside communities is a subjective
task, similar to the analysis of the results done in Section 6.2. However, the results
presented here seem to be much more consistent and explicit than the ones presented
in the previous chapter.
7.2
Biclustering
Another way of detecting groups of users is by the use of biclustering algo-
rithms (MADEIRA; OLIVEIRA, 2004). This technique differs from other clustering
methods (like the ones explored in Chapter 6) as it considers two dimensions of the
data,
when detecting groups.
Thus,
when applied to matrix 𝑇 ,
the algorithm finds
groups of users that present similar behaviour – i.e.
that shared the same group of
messages.
The InClose2 algorithm (ANDREWS, 2011) able to find all maximum biclus-
72
Chapter 7.
Experiments Set II - Influence of Connections on the Individual
Behaviour
ters on a binary matrix was used. However, as 𝑇 is extremely sparse, the algorithm
did not find large groups,
presenting biclusters with a maximum of 6 tweets and 4
users.
Moreover,
the noisy information present in 𝑇 (specially false negatives) also
affects the size of the found biclusters, as it “breaks” possible patterns.
A test was made to see if
there is coherence between the topics posted by
members of
the same bicluster.
To this,
the subjects of
the messages belonging to
the same bicluster were analysed,
but no evidence of
cohesion on the topics was
found, possibly agreeing with Observation 2.
Another experiment conducted was the verification if members of a bicluster
had a tendency to be connected on the social network. However, this was not verified
on the examined data,
leading to the belief
that the synchrony of
behaviour that
characterized the formation of
a bicluster was more associated with chance than
with any coherence pattern.
7.3
Discussion of the obtained results
The experiments made with the community detection have instigating effects,
when it shows that a group made exclusively by exploring connectivity patterns in
the social
network,
without any information regarding content,
can also be used to
group messages.
Therefore, evidences of the existence of a relationship between social connec-
tions and behaviour were shown.
However,
it is difficult to determine if
either the
social connections influence the individual behaviour, or if the social connections are
a consequence of already consolidated individual behaviours, that may be strength-
ened when inserted in a social environment characterized by the existence of people
with similar beliefs.
Nevertheless,
the analysis of this relation of cause and effect is
out of the scope of this work.
It should be noted that this relation was already explored in works such as
McPherson et al. (2001), that explores the concept of homophily on networks. Thus,
7.3.
Discussion of the obtained results
73
the ambition of this research is the aggregation of more empirical data to the ongoing
literature on the subject,
verifying the extent to which homophily is manifested in
OSNs, and the advance of computational methods that can be used to analyse other
human social structures.
The experiments made with biclustering tried to find a more strict relationship
between behaviour and type of message exchange. However, the observed results did
not reveal such pattern.
So,
to summarize the experiments presented on this chapter,
some observa-
tions can be outlined:
Observation 6.
There are indications of comportamental
coordination within com-
munities.
Observation 7. Apparently, some communities can be specialized in topics and this
knowledge can be used to characterize group of users and infer about active subjects
on the network.

Conclusion
8.1
Review of Achievements
This work intended to be an initial
exploration into the nowadays popular
Online Social Networks and into the events that take place on it.
The main motivation for this inquiry was the author’s interest in complex
phenomena that happen daily on those networks, such as information diffusion pro-
cesses,
collective attention and self-organization.
After concluding this stage of the
research,
it can be said that this work was a good opportunity to deepen in the
subject and get more insights on those fascinating processes.
However,
more than simply being inspired by the observable existence of
such phenomena,
the work focused on understanding and even predicting some of
the intriguing behaviours of groups of persons using an Online Social Service.
As a byproduct of
the research,
a survey of
computational
approaches for
online social
networks have been conceived,
with a summarized version of it being
presented at Chapter 2 of
this text.
As seen on the Chapter,
recently,
several
re-
searchers have been interested on this topic, proposing a wide range of applications.
The increasing volume of work produced is an evidence that this is a hot research
topic, although it is hard to predict for how long it will stay relevant.
In order to obtain a broad and complete perspective of the problem and also
to be able to model
and characterize those spatio-temporal
events,
concepts of the
complex systems theory were employed to investigate social networks. We were able
to collect, model and analyse real data, extracted from actual online social networking
service and verify its properties, using some topological indices of complex networks.
With the use of machine learning algorithms,
it was possible to detect pat-
terns on the collected data.
Evidences was shown to the fact that it is possible to

Conclusion
have indications of a message’s subject from its spatio-temporal
features,
and that
communities of users have cohesion in their behaviour.
8.2
Seeking Answers for the Proposed Questions
The experiments attempted to address the questions proposed in Chapter 4:
“Is it possible to predict behaviour, from external observations of the network?” (main
question).
Although this is a complex question that requires a more advanced of research
to be completely answered,
the experiments described on Chapters 6 and 7 could
capture some interesting aspects of it.
First, the experiments on Chapter 6 showed that it is possible to have a good
notion of the subjective aspects of a content being diffused, from the network’s char-
acterization.
Therefore,
the general
network characterization seems to be powerful
to describe specific aspects of the individuals behaviour, like interests, affinities and
the specific content of messages exchanged by him.
Going further in that line, Chapter 7 presented evidences of how social rela-
tionships affects the individual behaviour and vice versa. Thus, again, from observing
a network structure, it is possible to have relevant information about its components
behaviour.
Given this, an initial conclusion to the proposed question may be articulated:
based on the experiments, there are concrete evidences that it is possible to predict
behaviour, at least partially, from the characterization of the network’s properties.
8.3
Future Perspectives
Despite the work’s relevance to investigate the proposed questions, the find-
ings presented in this work can also be used to contribute with further research that
also uses data from online social networks.
8.3.
Future Perspectives
77
One straightforward contribution, supported by the findings of Chapter 6, is
the addition of
social
features (as the ones used in this work) on current machine
learning algorithms for topic detection. As the usual techniques of topic detection use
only features of the text when a topic is sought, the complementary use of features
extracted from the network is possibly able to bring new and helpful information.
Another potential contribution of this work would be to give support for data
intensive research on social sciences. Although the methods used on the experiments
are all
computational,
its empirical
discoveries can be used on studies of
diverse
subjects, such as sociology, psychology and economy.
Other aspects of the current research can still be investigated. Three examples
are (a) the investigation of
the process of
building a network and how it impacts
on behaviour,
(b) the exploration of the relationship between behaviour and other
aspects other than message topics, such as [personal preferences in specific contexts
or cultural
background,
and (c) a discussion on privacy issues and how individual
privacy can be affected by the use of network’s information.
