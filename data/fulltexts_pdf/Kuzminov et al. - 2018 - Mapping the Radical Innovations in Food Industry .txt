MAPPING THE RADICAL INNOVATIONS IN FOOD 
INDUSTRY: A TEXT MINING STUDY 
6
The article presents the results of the study of radical innovations in the global food in-
dustry which were obtained through semantic analysis of heterogeneous unstructured text data 
sources by applying innovative big data text mining system. The approach used allows perform-
ing rapid, yet comprehensive aggregation of the whole polyphony of existing knowledge of the 
technology development in any sector for traditional foresight, future oriented technology analy-
sis, and horizon scanning studies. The sources for the analysis include research papers, patent 
applications with both full-text data and additional structured metadata, analytical reports by 
main international organizations and national key players, various media and news resources, 
including all the major technology innovation, disruption and venture capital news websites. 
Their processing with an introduced approach for trend- and technology-mapping helps to identi-
fy ongoing and emerging technology-related trends, weak signals on possible scientific break-
throughs in the global food industry, including most promising startup strategies and food inno-
vation controversies. This kind of analysis can be performed on a regular basis owing to con-
stant accumulation of textual data and serve as a framework for constant science and technology 
(S&T) monitoring for early warning on changing technology landscape and its implications on 
agriculture and food markets. 
Keywords: radical innovations, trends, weak signals, big data, text mining, food industry.

Introduction 
The food industry is one of the main sectors in the modern economy, and a crucial one, as 
food and biological security issues are one of the central points in the policy agenda for virtually 
any government (Maggio et al. 2016). In addition, there are severe long-term risks for the stabil-
ity of global food system against the backdrop of yet unsolved hunger (von Grebmer et al. 2017), 
malnutrition (Sahn, 2015) and agricultural sustainability problems across the globe (Pretty et al. 
2010; Rockström et al. 2017). Only new technology revolutions in the sector can help solve these 
dire issues (King, 2017). Moreover, these disruptive changes are looming large, as more and 
more venture capital in developed countries is attracted to the food industry startups aiming to 
bring about the radical innovation, such as synthetic foods (World Preservation Foundation, 
2017), synbio replacements of traditional processes and items (Hayden, 2015), and other disrup-
tive changes, i.e. those threatening traditional markets, lifestyles, and cultural values (van der 
Boezem et al. 2015). The forecast of synthetic food future can be found in a publication by Win-
ston Churchill (1932) who claimed that “we shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole 
chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable me-
dium”. Earlier professor Berthelot in an interview in 1894 predicted that in the year 2000, “the 
epicure of the future is to dine upon artificial meat, artificial flour, and artificial vegetables” (Fer-
reira, 2017). After that time the issue of possible future forms of food heats the imagination of 
scholars, sci-fi writers and business especially on the waves of successes of chemistry, synthetic 
biology and other disciplines (see, for example, Belasco, 2006; Hubert et al. 2010; Selle & Bar-
rangou, 2015; Shelomi, 2016; Buscemi, 2018 and many others). 
Theme of innovations in food industry is growingly becoming controversial nowadays 
with international and non-governmental organizations, social movements, government and aca-
demia being in great concern about the way the food industry can feed growing global popula-
tion (Springer & Duchin, 2014; Thurner & Zaichenko, 2015; Smith, 2015; Hanjra et al. 2016). 
According to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimation (FAO, 2017), 
in 2050 when world population would reach 9.73 billion agriculture will face the requirement to 
produce almost 50 percent more food, feed and biofuel in comparison to 2012. Profound techno-
logical innovations offers an opportunity to meet future food needs sustainably. Food start-ups 
contribute to the discussion actively developing radical innovations that may change the sector 
(Chkaiban, 2016). 
Innovations are traditionally viewed as radical depending on the perceived degree of nov-
el knowledge incorporated in the innovation that must be grasped and the connected learning 
barriers (Kline & Rosenberg, 1986; Dewar & Dutton, 1986). Green et al (1995) in their classical 
research identified the following multiple dimensions of radical innovation: technological uncer-
tainty (the degree to which the technology employed in the innovative undertaking is not well 
developed or understood in the general scientific community), technical inexperience (the degree 
to which the firm lacks the required technological experience and knowledge), business inexpe-
rience (the degree to which the firm lacks required business experience and knowledge) and the 
technology development cost. Companies and governments more often use technology foresight 
methods in order to anticipate and respond to radical innovations (Vasamo et al. 2016). 
Traditionally food foresights are based on experts’ interviews, panel surveys and work-
shops. Salo et al. (2004) report on foresight study of the Finnish food and drink industries up un-
til 2015 which was based on semi-structured interviews, surveys and workshop for experts from 
industrial firms, research organizations and public agencies. One of the most complex and pro-
found international studies in this sphere is Foresight (2011) Global Food and Farming Futures 
Project that involved around 400 leading experts and stakeholders from about 35 low-, middle- 
and high-income countries who contributed to investigation of the challenges for the global food 
system until 2050 and development of indicators and tools that policy makers need to take. Jer-
mann et al. (2015) conducted research with the participation of food professionals from industry, 
academia and government in North America and Europe. Experts’ task was to identify novel 
4 
technologies either applied now or with the potential to be adopted in 5-10 years and evaluate 
commercialization factors, to enumerate associated regulations and limitations. 
Application of modern information technologies including Big Data analysis and text 
mining gains popularity in innovation studies including in food sector. Zong et al. (2010) analyze 
application of data mining in the food manufacturing industry for production and logistics man-
agement, coding systems, sales and customer data management. Ways of applying data mining 
for food supply networks analysis and management turn into a highly dynamic research field 
(Beulens et al. 2006; Ting et al. 2014). Another prospective area in food industry involves Natu-
ral-Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning innovative instruments implementation for 
automated food ontology construction, for example, for food traceability control (Salampasis et 
al. 2012; Pizzuti et al. 2014). Li and Ko (2007) proposed automated food ontology construction 
mechanism for diabetes diet care. Text mining is also used for nutritional content analysis of 
products' labels (Do Nascimento et al. 2013) or for mobile apps examination of side effects of 
food additives and another components via semantic web (Ertuğrul, 2016). 
However, there were little attempts conducted in horizon scanning of the food industry as 
a whole. Based on this rationale, the paper initiates to close the literature gap by complex map-
ping of innovations in food industry applying text mining and Big Data analysis techniques. 
When text mining software is exploited for science and technology (S&T) information 
resources in order to inform technology management tech mining (TM) approach emerges. It can 
be defined as the combination of bibliometrics, patent analysis and different NLP tools to collect, 
process and represent competitive technological intelligence in the visually understandable form 
(Porter & Cunningham, 2004; Yoon B., 2008). Until recently simple unrelated bibliometrics and 
patent analysis methods based on official classifications and citation indexes dominated the in-
dustry and technology research studies. As a rule, researchers tend to scope their field of study 
on clearly defined small samples of documents. 
The limitation of such approaches is that it is impossible to evaluate whether enough text 
corpus analyzed to make valid inference due to lack of confidence about data boundaries for 
fields. Moreover, different types of documents (for example, grants and patent applications, sci-
entific papers and media articles) rarely automatically analyzed in complex in order to reveal 
synergies 
among 
this 
data. 
Traditional 
orientation 
of 
many 
researches 
towards 
structured 
metadata highly determined by methodological, computational and technical difficulties of inte-
grated text mining. Using existing classifications not only prevents researchers from catching the 
young areas of innovation and science, yet not included in official taxonomies, but prevents them 
from optimally setting topic boundaries, as opposed to modern methods of topic clustering / top-
ic modelling approaches, which became de-facto standard in text mining applications since mid-
2000 (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2008; Chen, 2009; Ramage et al. 2011; Zhao et al., 2012; Chuang et 
al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). The approach based on bare keywords without semantic multipli-
ers (such as word2vec based associative / synonymous series of terms) is even weaker than the 
use of official taxonomies, as the results are ultra-sensitive to meaningless fluctuations in word 
usage patterns, homonyms, and lexical hypes (see application of these approaches in Levy and 
Bullinaria, 2001; Varathan et al., 2011; Goldberg and Levy, 2014; Rong, 2014; Vidra, 2015). To 
find, download and process the most relevant documents that potentially contain information 
about emerging S&T areas, researchers apply iterative processes from general search categories 
and terms to more concrete words and phrases (Haung et al., 2015). 
Taking into account these numerous drawbacks of such linear, non-machine learning 
(ML)-augmented approaches along with the absence of modern and complex horizon scanning 
exercises in the food industry, our research question sounds like: what are the potential and limi-
tations of text mining approach for mapping radical innovations in food industry. Accordingly 
the paper proceeds as follows: first, it describes the research methodology, second, it presents the 
results obtained. They include maps of main thematic segments that were categorized in semi-
5 
automated way coupled with the grouping of the technologies and scientific research topics 
based on two-dimensional (impact and growth of impact
7
) clustering into four categories: weak 
signals, emerging trends, stable segments and niche activities together with additionally identi-
fied weak signals on possible scientific breakthroughs in the global food industry, including most 
promising startup strategies and food innovation controversies. Finally, the paper deals with the 
critical discussion of the potential and limitations of text mining approach for mapping radical 
innovations in food industry. 
Methodology 
The acceleration of the development of science, technology and innovation entails a radi-
cal transformation of markets, business models (Baden-Fuller & Haefliger, 2013), methods of 
production and distribution of products and services, institutions and socio-cultural relations 
(Fountain, 2004; Kallinikos, 2010). Being highly dynamical and important, the innovation pro-
cess in agriculture & food (A&F) sector is one that is needed to be monitored objectively, con-
tinuously and thoroughly (Hoholm, 2011). According to IBM (2017), 90% of the data in the 
world today has been created in just the last two years. The rapid growth of unstructured infor-
mation, particularly heterogeneous textual data, which is not feasible to analyze by traditional 
methods, is becoming a serious challenge for the adoption of evidence-based and timely deci-
sions (see e.g. Tsui et al., 2014; Grau et al., 2015; Bystrov et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2016; Engel 
2017 as the examples of latest discussions on this topic). The importance of evidence-based ap-
proaches (in spotting critical technologies, existing and emerging trends, as well as forecasting 
future development and setting STI priorities) as the way to reduce sectoral experts’ subjectivity, 
incompleteness of their knowledge and bias of views favoring familiar subject areas has been in 
the center of attention of many technology and strategy stakeholders for a long time (Davies, 
1987; Tichy, 2004; Ecken et al. 2011). 
However, recent progress in both hardware and software produced a number of enabling 
technologies and methods providing robust solutions to data analysis challenges mentioned earli-
er. The rapid development of big data requires prompt notification of key decision-makers in sci-
ence, technology and innovation (STI). Therefore, in the era of big data the efficient work of de-
cision makers is impossible without the use of automatic monitoring and analytical information 
systems, built in the paradigm of data mining; machine learning; self-improving deep-learning-
based prediction models; natural language processing; knowledge discovery; agile user-friendly 
automatic ontology building; rich context insight-oriented user experience, etc. For example, de 
Miranda Santo et al. (2006) started applying text mining (TM) to scientific publications in order 
to spot major topics in the emerging and highly dynamic sphere of nanotechnology in order to 
make up the limited knowledge of experts. Altuntas et al. (2015) looked at patent data to assess 
technology readiness levels and their potential for further development relying on alternative ap-
proaches and indicators. Zhang et al. (2016) used National Science Foundation (NSF) awards 
data to identify technology topics, their dynamics and attempt to forecast future development in 
the computer science area of big data research. 
In this context, our article studies the ongoing and emerging technological changes in the 
global agriculture and food sector (using the case study of food market innovations) by applying 
original big data augmented text mining system, developed in the National Research University 
Higher School of Economics, Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge (IS-
SEK HSE) (see Figure 1 for details).

This text mining system for analytical tasks in the field of technology foresight responds 
to the following challenges: 
1) Efficient processing the growing amount of information about the development of sci-
ence, technology and innovation, which usually leads to an information overload of experts and 
analysts and cannot be adequately processed without the use of automated methods for the ex-
traction and systematization of knowledge. 
2) Answering the growing need for automated systems for the monitoring and analysis of 
data from various sources to ensure timely, science-based decisions in STI policy (on the state 
and corporate levels). 
3) Reducing the growing risks of unfounded expert claims that may not always be ade-
quately verified due to shortage of time and require, therefore, automated integrity control tools. 
4) Answering the need for objective verification of experts involved in the preparation of 
materials and discussions for the formation of science and technology policy. 
5) Counterbalancing the negative effects of increasing specialization and fragmentation 
of knowledge of individual scientists, researchers and industry experts, as well as specialists of 
public authorities in STI policy in the era of interdisciplinary research and convergence of tech-
nologies. 
The article builds on recent Russian Agriculture and Food Industry Foresight 2030 
(Gokhberg & Kuzminov, 2017; Gokhberg et al. 2017 a). It encompasses a wide range of quanti-
tative and qualitative methods: in-depth interviews with managers and leading experts, survey 
with 400 participants from more than 50 specialized companies, research organizations and uni-
versities and workshops along with text mining of more than 12 thousand analytical and fore-
sight documents for trends identification. Semantic analysis of heterogeneous unstructured text 
data sources was conducted and resulted in complex depiction of ongoing and emerging technol-
ogy-related trends in the area of food innovation. 
The study of radical innovations in the global food industry implied making an extensive, 
momentary snapshot of the situation in the area (tech trends, key players, prospects of develop-
ment) with the use of original big data augmented text mining analysis of recent texts describing 
significant research and development results, as well as most recent newsfeeds and web publica-
tions. The sources for the analysis are heterogeneous and include vast amounts of research pa-
pers, patent and grants applications with both full-text data and additional structured metadata, 
analytical reports by main international organizations and national key players, various media 
and news resources, including all the major technology innovation, disruption and venture capi-
7 
tal news websites. The choice of information sources for the analysis is based on the results of a 
reputation assessment of the quality, reliability of data sources (including taking into account the 
impact factor of scientific journals, the citation of scientific publications, the popularity of pro-
fessional Internet resources, the ratings of analytical centers, etc.). Filling of the database was 
accomplished with the use of both subscription-based and free sources to the volume of petabyte 
scale (of bare text) with the use of continuous automated data accumulation techniques. The 
methodological principles of gathered data integration corresponds to standard practices in in-
formation management. 
The general approach of the study draws on a wide array of tools from computer science, 
on the one hand, and the convergent methodology of technology foresight, future-oriented tech-
nology analysis, trend spotting and tech mining (see Popper 2008a, 2008b; Miles et al., 2016), on 
the other. The tools developed on this basis include the instruments for large-scale collection, 
extraction, and transformation of data; knowledge discovery; integrated statistical, syntactic, and 
semantic analysis of text and natural language processing. 
The developed methodology combines statistical and semantic analysis of the full textual 
content of documents, as well as structured metadata with the elements of machine learning and 
expert-proved sectoral ontologies (e.g. a formal naming and definition of the types, properties, 
and interrelationships of the entities in a particular domain) developed in semi-automated way 
during the 10 years of trends and technologies mapping within the framework of the Long-Term 
Science and Technology Foresight of the Russian Federation (more methodological details see in 
Bakhtin et al. 2017; Gokhberg et al. 2017 b). 
The principal components of the text-mining based sectoral trend and technology spotting 
rely on ngram identification and categorization, knowledge extraction based on syntactic and on-
tology relationships of hierarchical nested synonym sets and, finally, pattern recognition of 
strictly typed statements on the technology evolution milestones and future forecast estimates 
along with statistical indicators of dynamics and intensity.
All documents from all sources analyzed are processed using the same instrumental pipe-
line based on the use of open program libraries that integrate best practices to obtain reliable re-
sults. The primary processing of the natural language is carried out – the transformation of large 
arrays of unstructured textual information into structured tables, arrays and vector representa-
tions. For this each document is divided into separate sentences, words and phrases with differ-
ent linguistic characteristics. 
Foremost documents are split into sentences, sentences are tokenized (split into words) 
and words are lemmatized (all word forms used in the text are standardized to normal form), syn-
tactic relationships are calculated using "property-function" approach. These connections that 
characterize the properties and functions describing nouns are considered to be the basis for the 
formation of meaningful terms. 
Later, ngrams (phrases that combine n amount of words) are built using the syntactic rela-
tionships of governor word (usually noun) with other words through "adjective modifier" and 
"compound" dependencies (e.g. “innovative pig farming”, where farming – is a governor word, 
innovative – is an adjective modifier of farming, pig – compound dependency of farming). Then, 
based on the table of terms and their relation to the document, the matrix of co-occurrence is cal-
culated based on terms that appear in the same document. 
Once the co-occurrence matrix is built, the network analysis can be performed. Each term 
in the matrix represents a separate node of the graph. The amount of documents, where two 
terms occur, represents the weighted edge between nodes. Network analysis helps to calculate 
the centrality of each node (the amounts of edges that connect to the node with their weights). 
Then, clustering algorithm is applied to divide graphs into subgraphs of the most closely 
related nodes. In other words, the more co-occurrence a group of terms have between each other, 
the more probability that they end up in the same cluster. Once clustering is done, it objectively 
divides all terms in several groups. These groups are perceived as S&T topics. Optionally, they 
can be named by N most central ngrams constituting them, like it is done in Web of Science re-
8 
search fronts (see more Kessler, 1960; Small, 1973, 1980; Garfield, 1990 on methodological ba-
sis of research fronts detection). 
After all extracted terms are grouped into topics, their trending behavior can be analyzed. 
For that matter the study uses calculation of relative textual statistics, cauterization and classifi-
cation of results based on dynamics and relative occurrence of terms in the documents of the 
study area. Such representation of data is perceived as time series where the main task is to di-
vide all terms by their trend patterns as part of the dynamic clustering based on the following pa-
rameters. 
The frequency index demonstrates the amount of times term occurs in documents. The 
more term occurs – the more popular it is, which in turn shows its general relevance to the topic 
of food. This index calculated and then normalized as: 
𝑓

The trending index for each term is the proxy of the growth or reduction of general atten-
tion to a specific term. It means, the higher the index, the bigger the increase of occurrence in 
documents the term had from 2005 to 2015. Trending index is calculated based on the slope of 
the linear trend of a given term’s statistics distribution over the years in the corpus of food-
related documents using following formula of linear regression equation: 
𝑘 =

𝑓

– term frequency based on occurrence in documents of a particular year. 
Trend mapping helps to classify items based on frequency and trending indexes. When 
trend mapping is done for the clusters as a whole, proportion of high trending terms (by distribu-
tion quintiles) is used for discriminations. Trend mapping of terms used only terms representing 
objects of certain kinds (concepts, events, technologies, markets), and can also be enriched by 
trend mapping of terms representing named entities (companies, persons, geographies, etc.). 
9 
Trend maps are accompanied by semantic maps that show the thematic structure of the 
analyzed area: what narrow themes and special concepts does it consist, how it can be catego-
rized. The end result of using the tool of semantic maps for knowledge discovery and further in-
terpretation of the results by the experts are reasonable structural lists and rankings (based on 
described text-mining statistical proxy) of future directions or systemic problems in a particular 
field, as well as recommendations for priority areas of development. 
Identification of semantic patterns is another type of used text mining tools. Trends, weak 
signals and other data patterns were identified using two text-mining-oriented approaches: 
quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative identification relies on term statistics of occurrence in 
documents over the years (trends = high dynamics + high frequency, weak signals = high dy-
namics + low frequency). Qualitative spotting is based on linguistic patterns in the sentences – 
statements that might describe trends, weak signals and other potentially relevant objects. For 
example, phrases with verbs in future tense or gerund form that describe some transformation, 
increase or decrease in values or other forms of dynamics can describe trends. 
On the basis of described analysis major global trends, promising areas of science and 
technology development can be identified, as well as organizations and key experts being centers 
of radical innovations in each field can be mapped. 
Results
Quantitative findings: extraction of main topics and calculating trends 
In a first step, we plot intuitive, user-friendly visualizations of automatically generated 
ontologies of considered field – semantic maps. As mentioned earlier they show the most rele-
vant topics within the studied corpus of proceeded documents (food-related documents in our 
case) and their interrelationships. Semantic maps are formed from processing of large arrays of 
text data from scientific publications, patents, industry analytical documents or popular news, but 
can be built from a small corpus of specially selected documents or pseudodocuments of various 
sizes (as a general rule, about 10 to 20 thousand separate topical sentences are enough for build-
ing a robust stably clustered graph visualized by a semantic map). Semantic maps are very useful 
in cases where there are no official classifications or established taxonomy for the studied ob-
jects. They are valuable tool for the structural characterization of areas of scientific and techno-
logical development, including emerging ones. Semantic maps also provide recommendations on 
effective search terms to further find relevant information in iterative, interactive way. In addi-
tion, they can be used for quick characterization of some corpus documents, allowing the user to 
make a quick decision about whether it is necessary to carefully examine the particular docu-
ment. 
Figure 2 is a semantic map of more than 3000 terms that occurred more than 2 times in 
the corpus of about 12 000 food-related texts: including research papers, patent and grants appli-
cations, analytical reports by main international organizations and national key players, various 
media and news resources, including all the major technology innovation, disruption and venture 
capital news websites. On this map we can see the key topics of scientific interest in the field of 
food innovation. Every single node (bubbles) on a semantic map represents a term derived from 
a corpus of the studied documents. Location, size, and color of each item have a strict mathe-
matical sense. Bubble size is determined by number of term occurrences in the studied corpus 
documents. All terms are grouped into 12 clusters (with 20-50 to several hundred terms in each) 
based on their semantic closeness. The color of bubbles represents dynamically allocated clus-
ters according to the results of solving an optimization problem of the classification of unstruc-
tured full-text data derived from the corpus food-related documents. Configuration of areas with 
high density of bubbles of one cluster (color) also has direct meaning. If this area is on the pe-
10 
riphery and placed compactly it represent a narrow, niche field of research. If the area is located 
close to the center of a map and is scattered in different directions it means that a given topic 
(within food industry) has many interdisciplinary connections and is highly convergent. For a 
more clear understanding we present the most important terms from this scientific map in Table 
1. 
Figure 2. Semantic map of terms extracted from food-related documents 
Note: Each bubble represents a single term derived from food-related documents. Bubble size is determined 
by number of term occurrences in the studied corpus of documents. All terms are grouped into 12 clusters based on 
their semantic closeness. Clusters are highlighted by different colors.

Semantic analysis of food-related documents shows that the most frequently used term is 
“tissue engineering”. This term occurred 1627 times in the corpus of 12 000+ food-related doc-
uments. The other main topic clusters (named as centers of strongly connected colored groups of 
terms) are the following trends, issues and instruments applied in food innovations: "amino ac-
id", "oxidative stress", "gene expression", "infrared spectroscopy", "mechanical property", "cell 
proliferation", "body 
weight", 
"molecular mechanism", "abiotic stress", 
"liquid chromatog-
11 
raphy", "insulin resistance", "sensitive detection", "food allergy". The most dynamic food-related 
terms (in term of growth of number of occurrences) is “protein complex” with term trending in-
dex value of 7.16 points. The other highly dynamic term is “food ingredient” (term trending in-
dex is 5.43). The most frequently occurred food-related terms in general have low values of term 
trending index.

Notes: 1. This table shows the most frequently occurred terms in the corpus of 12 000+ food-related docu-
ments. 2. Term trending index shows the growth of number of this term occurrences. Highest values of term fre-
quency and term trending index indicators are highlighted in green, the lowest values – in red.

For more efficient identification of trends in the studied area, structural analysis of terms 
derived from food-related documents is complemented by the visualization of the significance 
(popularity index) and dynamism (trending index) of these terms. Such an analysis allows clearly 
12 
identify in addition to trends also the stagnating topics of interest and so-called weak signals (for 
example, emerging technologies or potential future markets). 
Figure 3 visualizes trend map or the scatterplot on the axes of popularity index and trend-
ing index for the terms, derived from food-related documents. Popularity index (horizontal axis) 
measures the mean intensity of the discussion of a given topic in the corpus of processed food-
related documents. It is calculated as the term frequency of occurrence in the documents. Trend-
ing index (vertical axis) measures the growth of relative occurrence of a given term from year to 
year over a period of time. 
Trend map is an intuitive visualization that allows us to divide the subjects of most im-
portant technologies, markets, companies, etc. on four quadrants depending on the value of 
popularity and trending index for each specific term – higher/below the median values of popu-
larity and trending index for all terms derived from food-related documents. 
Figure 3. Clusters of terms by research and development significance and trending rate 
Source: National Research University Higher School of Economics’s Text Mining System 
In the upper right quadrant fast-growing popular topics are concentrated. Topics in the 
upper left are weak signals (possible future blockbusters that yet not very well-known but are 
extremely fast growing in overall popularity / impact). In the lower right quadrant popular but 
stagnant topics are concentrated. Finally the lower left quadrant is filled by traditional niche top-
ics (they are neither very impactful, nor fast growing – of course, in relation to the leaders; but 
the mere fact of their appearance on a trend map while thousands of other terms have so low val-
ues that are out of bounds of the trend map – tells us that these topics are also very important).

Detailed analysis: future of food based on documents of 2016 
In order to understand the latest developments in the sphere of food, we built separate 
semantic map and other analytical outputs for the documents published in 2016
8
(Figure 4). This 
allows for spotting the newest trends, weak signals, research areas, technologies and other rele-
vant terms. 
Figure 4. Core concepts for the future of food, 2016 
Source: National Research University Higher School of Economics’s Text Mining System 
We proxy the importance of a term by comparing normalized popularity indexes in differ-
ent sources of data (analytic reports, research papers or media and news). This way we distill a 
total of 386 terms most relevant to the field. For example, the term "stem cell" indeed marks a 
relevant trend, but it is enthusiastically used in media papers. In contrast to such buzzwords, 
terms like "food product", "food security", "food safety" and to a lesser extent "dairy product" 
and "dairy production" are terms that are specific for analytical reports. A high values of normal-
ized indicators show that the term is relevant, impactful, significant, resilient
9
and thereby marks 
an important trend.

Looking onto the values of calculated rates we can also detect "purely scientific" terms – 
those that have high values of specificity for scientific papers in relation to media, news and ana-
lytical reports. These terms are e.g. "membrane protein", "protein complex", "rainbow trout", 
"membrane bioreactor" and some other. They are either topics that cannot be efficiently commu-
nicated to wide society from science by now (too sophisticated research, early research, or re-
search irrelevant to current and prospective challenges). 
Case study: cultured meat 
All clusters of terms identified in during semantic analysis show general distribution of 
topics of studied research area with all interlinkages. However, content of each cluster can be 
assessed in bigger detail. Terms of one cluster can be further clustered into even smaller groups 
to show hierarchy of lower levels. 
For further discussion, we chose the cluster for "cultured meat" – one of the clusters on the 
big map with term “cultured meat” being its center (describing the main theme of the spotted 
topic) (Figure 5). Cultured meat is also known as cell-cultured meat, in-vitro meat, artificially 
cultured meat, lab meat, lab-grown meat or synthetic meat. This cluster contains about 600 terms 
related to food innovation in general (all irrelevant terms and stop words were excluded). How-
ever, only 96 of these terms have indeed a high impact (occurrence greater than 10). 
16 
Figure 5. Fragment of semantic map for "cultured meat" cluster 
Note: Each bubble represents a single term derived from food-related documents. Bubble size is determined 
by number of term occurrences in the studied corpus. All terms from “cluttered meat” cluster are again grouped into 
subclusters based on their semantic closeness. Subclusters are highlighted by different colors.

In the center of the semantic map for artificial meat are the thematic areas with highest 
impact and with the greatest involvement in global interdisciplinary context. Out of all concepts 
the followings trends can be identified: fortified foodstuffs, vitamin-rich soft drinks, plant-
protein-based meat, milk and eggs substitutes, artificially-grown meat, personalized food and 
many other. 
Qualitative findings: extraction of meaningful statements about future of food 
Knowledge extraction based on syntactic and ontology relationships of hierarchical nest-
ed synonym sets and pattern recognition of strictly typed statements on the technology evolution 
milestones and future forecast estimates enriches the insights acquired by the use of semantic 
maps and trend maps. All the statements of the knowledge extraction module are relevant fin-
ished sentences with their neighboring sentences constituting the context of the statements, and 
various forms of their automatic and semi-automatic, rule-based and ML-based aggregation and 
generalizations. 
One of the most useful types of statements to be extracted are quantitative forecast esti-
mates. Quantitative and qualitative forecast estimates are those statements in the texts that de-
scribe the prospects for the development of any markets, market segments or products in quanti-
17 
tative terms (average annual growth rate of the market, its volume, etc.) or in qualitative (textual 
description of possible scenarios for market development). In addition to market information, 
forecasts can also include any information about the strategic plans of companies and countries, 
adopted laws, expected phenomena (like global warming), etc. We can automatically identify 
such statements by marker terms, dictionaries of market indicators and named entities (names of 
companies and their products, geographical locations, etc.) along with their syntactic links to 
other terms in the sentences. Box 1 and Box 2 provide the examples of global food projections 
extracted from food-related documents. 
Box 1. Key identified global food projections before 2030 
Feeding the growing world population will require cheap fats and protein sources

With the world’s population is expected to increase to 8 billions in 2028 from 6.5 bil-
lions in 2005, only palm oil has the potential to be the source of fats and vegeta-
ble oil to feed the people around the globe (Tan et al., 2009).

World trade in soybean meal climbs by more than 12 million tons (about 21 per-
cent) in the projections to 2020 (USDA, 2011). 
Global agriculture cannot produce necessary amounts of grain to sustainably sup-
port meat livestock farming

The global demand for grain in 2030 would reach 5.1 billion tones if the world’s 
population adopted approximately the same diet enjoyed by Europeans. This 
would create a global grain shortfall of 2.3 billion tones, compared with estimated 
2030 production of 2.8 billion tones. Demand in 2030 will not reach 5.1 billion tones 
because many people in the world will still lack the necessary income to increase 
their consumption of animal protein.
Fish food production to play major role in global protein supply growth 

World per capita fish food consumption is projected to reach 20.6 kg in 2022, up 
from nearly 19 kg per capita, on average, in 2010-12 (OECD-FAO, 2013). 

Not only is world per capita fish consumption to rise by 16 percent by 2021 from 
2011 levels, but overall global seafood production is predicted to rise from 154 
million metric tones in 2011 to 172 million tones by 2021 (FAO, 2014). 
Global demand for milk and milk substitutes will steadily grow

At a global level, the demand for dairy products will expand by 23% over the ten 
year projection period, approaching 48 Mt by 2024 (OECD-FAO, 2015). 
18 
Forecasts, estimates, retrospective milestones, enumerations of technologies, skills, etc. 
are good for general foresight tasks. However, we also have in our arsenal other instruments, 
suitable for strictly practical market forecasts and business intelligence tasks. Among them are 
statements on innovative companies’ strategies. We show this on the case study of food industry 
startups business models that can shape the future structure of food markets. 
The Text Mining System derived startup strategies from the corpus of food-related doc-
uments. To detect them we apply the developed technique of special words and syntactic models 
identification in media and news texts that radically increase the probability of a sentence con-
taining them to characterize startup strategies. The practical application of this techniques de-
rives the list of more than 100 startups from food industry. Some of them are presented below 
(see 
Box 
3)
Box 2. Key identified global food projections after 2030 
World’s population will grow further, which will require new industrial methods of 
food production

The world’s population is expected to grow to over 9 billion people by 2050; 
there will be a need to raise food production by some 70 percent globally and 
by almost 100 percent in developing countries (FAO, 2012 a). 
Climate change poses additional risks to traditional agriculture systems

If global average temperature increases by more than 2 degrees Celsius, it will 
be difficult to secure enough food for the global population, which is projected 
to increase to 9 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2012 b). 
Growing livestock sector can become unsustainable, which will require synthetic 
meat production instead

The share of livestock production (meat, milk and dairy products and eggs) in to-
tal world production would increase from 36 percent in 2005/2007 to 39 percent 
in 2050 (from 30 to 35 percent in the developing countries) (FAO, 2012 c). 

In response to the projected demand growth, production of meat and dairy prod-
ucts in the developing world is projected to increase substantially by 2050 com-
pared with 1999/2001 volumes. Between those years, total production of meat and 
dairy products by developing country farmers is projected to grow by 206M 
tones and 410M tones respectively (Boland et al., 2013). 
Aquaculture will remain one of the key solutions to the global food problem

Given a current fisheries and aquaculture production for human consumption of 
about 136.2 million tones (animals from capture fisheries and aquaculture), with 
annual per capita fish consumption remaining at 19.2kg, a similar proportion of 
fish going into fishmeal, fish oil and other non-food uses as today, and a world 
population of 9.6 billion people, approximately 47.5 million additional tones of 
food fish will be needed in 2050 (FAO, 2014).

Further our text mining system allows to detect innovation controversies. We determine 
as innovation controversy the following statements about ongoing conflict, radical discrepancy 
between opinions of key stakeholders or other series of events featuring diverging interests and 
points of view, confrontation with unclear future results. To detect innovation controversy from a 
separate document we use sentiment analysis with the use of custom rules and dictionaries. Some 
examples of about 300 innovation controversies derived from news items about food innovations 
are presented below (Box 4).

The food and supplement industries have been very willing to promote the fear of 
scarcity of these functional nutrients, in order to construct consumer demand for 
their fortified foods and nutritional supplements, such as cholesterol-lowering 
margarine fortified with plant sterols, omega-3 enriched orange juice and probiotic 
yogurts.

Technically, the Food and Drug Administration frowns on the practice of fortifying 
snack foods or carbonated beverages with added nutrients ... The FDA is planning 
Experimental Studies on Consumer Responses to Nutrient Content Claims on Forti-
fied Food – that means they want to find out whether fortifying snack foods with 
vitamins and noting its nutritional content on labels would convince people to 
swap out regular old junk food with a slightly less unhealthy form of junk food. 
Your 'federal family' at work, supposedly to protect you, again? No, this is about 
changing a 20 year old rule regarding labels on foods that have been modified to be a 
little healthier.

Finally our text mining system allow determining weak signals on possible scientific 
breakthroughs by identifying certain syntactic constructions with special verb tenses and certain 
modal verbs used. Statements with adverbs, adjectives and other words that display low level of 
certainty (might, may, can) along with various values may display weak signals. Weak signals 
refer to “the early signs of possible but not confirmed changes that may later become more sig-
nificant indicators of critical forces for development, threats, business and technical innovation” 
(Saritas & Smith, 2011). They represent the first signs of paradigm shifts, or future trends, driv-
ers or discontinuities. In this respect, the study of weak signals aims at collecting and analyzing 
data for the purpose of providing early indications of potential developments in particular field. 
The anticipatory intelligence gathered through the scanning of weak signals is used to provide 
stakeholders opportunities to develop early responses to capitalize on, protect against, or mitigate 
the impact of potential disruptions in the future. Some examples are presented in Box 5.

Discussion and conclusions 
Timeliness of conducted research is noticeable in conditions of rapid growth of unstruc-
tured information about highly dynamical and important innovation process in agriculture and 
food sector, which is becoming not feasible to analyze by traditional methods in order to make 
evidence-based and timely decisions. The results of the study with an application of big data text 
mining approach include the multifaceted lists and maps of ongoing and emerging technology-
related trends, along with weak signals on possible scientific breakthroughs in the global food 
industry coupled with most promising startup strategies and food innovation controversies. 
Among the identified trends in food sector innovations the most influential one is tissue 
engineering strongly connected with artificially-grown (cultured) meat which was viewed in 
more details. As the most dynamic topics were named those related with proteins and food 
chemistry. Issues of consumers' obesity prevention and food allergy responses were also includ-
ed in the map of radical innovations directions in global food industry. Par to the course these 
topics were found in the text-mining-derived startup strategies from the corpus of food-related 
documents which are mostly connected with synthetic food innovations and personalized food. 
In addition to this picture it was illustrated that most food innovation controversies are related to 
legal status improvement of radical innovations, food labeling and consumers' anxieties about 
fortified and synthetic foods. Identified weak signals on possible scientific breakthroughs include 
advance of packaging materials with special properties for keeping food fresh for longer time, 
approach to more personalized food production through customized breeding, enriched proteins 
application and food-related health problems prevention. Summing-up, conducted research al-
lowed to map a complex picture of sectoral radical innovations and future development direc-
tions, in contrast with previous research traditionally focused on particular narrow aspects and 
separate branches of food industry. 
Mostly it was achieved owing to an introduced approach for trend- and technology-
mapping based on big data text mining. As our research question was about the potential of text 
mining methods for mapping the radical innovations in food industry, we demonstrated that their 
advantages include possibility of combination of broad scope of information sources in a com-
plex analysis with high velocity and reproducibility based on standardized data processing and 
analysis procedures. It enhances transparency and objectivity of the analysis as well as possibili-
ties of periodic monitoring which is crucial in mapping of radical innovations in food industry. 
Along with reproducibility and high level of formalization, text mining approach brings 
speed as one of the main benefits for application in many areas in both private and public sec-
tors. This type of analysis can be performed on a regular basis (up to weekly periodicity) based 
on constant accumulation of textual data and serves as a framework for constant S&T monitoring 
for early warning on changing technology landscape and its implications on markets. 
The instrument is also suitable for express testing of the expert perspectives, hypotheses, 
insights and desk-research-based analytics and reports based on them, mainly for gap analysis on 
the important sectoral topics covered. The methodology implemented programmatically in a rad-
ically new (and highly specialized) interactive information system brings to an expert an inte-
grated analytical environment. This environment augments the expert's capabilities by bringing 
attention to gaps in overviews of existing trends and in recommendations on the future actions, 
and by suggesting comprehensive yet comprehensible lists of high-level constructs based on long 
traditions and time-proven foresight / future studies methodologies. Developed approach allows 
performing rapid aggregation of the whole polyphony of existing expert views on the technology 
development in virtually any area. The application of the implemented hybrid expert-machine 
learning interaction reduces to a very high extent subjectivity, bias and incompleteness of expert 
knowledge as opposed to bare (un-augmented) desk-research and expert-panel approaches tradi-
tional in technology foresight studies. 
Together with the advantages described, our research also allows to figure out certain 
limitations of text mining approach for horizon scanning tasks. First of all, any text mining study 
23 
faces the challenge of comprehensive and 
sufficient coverage of information sources to be pro-
cessed and analyzed. As all sorts of empirical research are sensitive to input data quality, text 
mining especially delicate in documents sampling procedures as far as biased corpus analysis can 
result in inaccurate output, illustrating only one side of the considered complex issue. Therefore 
the most promising strategy there is the usage of big data samples which can guarantee necessary 
heterogeneity of raw input data. 
Strongly connected with this aspect is another challenge for productive big data augment-
ed text mining approaches – technical limitations of efficient storage and high-performance 
analysis of big data to make possible the fast and flexible output delivery. These problems de-
mand an application of advanced methods and algorithms developed in modern computer sci-
ence along with high-performance server infrastructure entailing appreciable capital investments 
and recruitment of top-class specialists. An alternative to development of proprietary text mining 
system more relevant for small-scale studies and assuming less possibilities of flexible calibra-
tion and adaptation of analytical tools is the purchase of license for private text mining software 
like VantagePoint
10
or TechWatchTool
11
. However, working with these tools usually presuppose 
a lot of manual cleaning, filtering and grouping of keywords in order to evaluate the presented 
information. Furthermore, the majority of systems are limited to standard data representations 
(lists, co-occurrence matrices and factor/cluster maps), which do not allow to work deeply with 
dependencies between different types of data (for example, building multidimensional relation-
ships). 
Based on obtained results it can be supposed that further studies can develop the ap-
proach proposed by adding complexity to big data text mining proxies of sectoral radical innova-
tions on the basis of flexible combination of various information sources. For instance, proposed 
trend map quadrants method has a specific limitation due to dependence of term popularity on 
generalization level and several other factors connected with peculiar properties of each type of 
information sources. For example, it might be the case that a term is often used and at the same 
time often criticized, being popular in negative terms rather than illustrating prospective area for 
company development or investment. Another example can be connected with the excessive at-
tention in media sources to overestimated but lacking in prospects so called hype concepts and 
products being promoted by PR agents and other interested stakeholders. Additional analytical 
tools like sentiment analysis or life cycle analysis are needed for more reliable evaluation. Fur-
ther development of the research field will be connected with the necessity to look at the radical 
innovations in food industry in the broader context, taking into account along with sectoral 
tendencies also a big picture of global challenges and trends. 
Alongside the sectoral researchers and future-oriented studies methodologists, the results 
of the study can also be used in strategic planning activities by governments and corporations in 
the agriculture and food sector, as well as some adjoining industries, such as agricultural ma-
chine building, mineral fertilizers and other agrochemicals, biofuels industry, fisheries, environ-
ment protection, information & communication, space and robotics for smart & precision agri-
culture. Another area of application is setting the priorities of STI policy in food industry and 
supporting / regulating the advanced food technologies, in the paradigm of evidence-based poli-
cy-making. Furthermore, results create the basis for new directions of venture investments and 
sectoral best practices adaptation, as they include extracted data on successful technology startup 
strategies covered by specialized sectoral media sources.
