Latent
semantic analysis—a technique to quantify qualitative data—was used on a
large dataset of near death experience (NDE) accounts for which a sizable portion also
had scores on Greyson’s NDE Scale.
Given previous research with the NDE Scale
showing there is a “core NDE” comprised of a probabilistic hierarchy of cognitive,
affective,
transcendental,
and paranormal
components,
we hypothesized that
there
would be a similar hierarchy of experiential
components reflected in NDErs’ verbal
accounts as evidenced by a significant
relation between NDE intensity and NDE
content. Predictions were largely confirmed. The verbal accounts associated with True
NDEs,
defined by above median scores
on the NDE Scale,
stood out
as
highly
structured episodes with a clear framework comprised of seven major linguistic clusters
of
descriptors.
Four
of
the linguistic factors
included transcendent
or
paranormal
themes, whereas the remaining three factors tended to focus on both vague and specific
references
to physiological
or
environmental
elements.
The results
are argued to
support concurrent validity issues with Greyson’s NDE Scale and illustrate how latent
semantic analysis
(LSA)
and related approaches
can be used to study qualitative
information across topics relevant to the many facets of theory-building in conscious-
ness studies.

Medical
and social
scientists
have
long
known that some adults and children suddenly
faced with death experience a distinctive state
of consciousness in which their existence was
seemingly unbounded by the physical
body or
earthly environs
(Blackmore,
1996,
2012;
Locke & Shontz,
1983; Ring,
1980).
Termed a
near-death experience (NDE),
this state is de-
fined as
a transcendental
experience precipi-
tated by a confrontation with death and which
does not
seem to be adequately understood as
the mere phenomenology of a dying or medi-

NDEs are among the most
dramatic of
exceptional
human experiences (Holden et
al.,
2009) with many percipients interpreting them
partly or wholly as “mystical, spiritual, or para-
normal” occurrences.
In fact,
the Diagnostic
Manual
of
Statistical
and Mental
Disorders
added the V-Code category “Religious or Spir-
itual
Problem,” in part
to acknowledge and
guide clinicians in addressing the psychological
impact
and aftereffects
of
NDEs
and related
experiences
(Brown,
2011;
Lukoff,
Lu,
&
Turner,
1998;
Turner,
Lukoff,
Barnhouse,
&
Lu,
1995).
To advance clinical
and empirical
work in
understanding this phenomenon, Bruce Greyson
designed the NDE Scale (Greyson, 1983, 1985,
1990) to quantify the intensity of NDEs accord-
ing to their cognitive, affective, transcendental,
and paranormal components. The scale was spe-
cifically developed through an iterative process
from an initial list of 80 phenomenological fea-
tures
reported to be characteristic of
NDEs.
Analysis of item-total score correlations yielded
a 16-item scale,
which had face validity and
which was highly correlated with other
mea-
sures of NDEs. Moreover, this scale differenti-
ated unequivocal
NDEs
from ambiguous
or
questionable experiences. Each of the 16 expe-
riences is rated in terms of three ordered cate-
gories that
generically represent
“not
present,”
“mildly or
ambiguously present,” or
“defini-
tively present,” but whose exact wording varies
depending on the nature of
questions.
When
such categories are scored 0,
1,
and 2 a sum-
score of 32 can be achieved. In earlier research
(Greyson, 1983, 1990) a sum of 7 was chosen as
the criterion for
identifying someone with a
“True-NDE,” because that value was one stan-
dard deviation below the mean among a crite-
rion group of NDErs.
This approach was later
validated in a comparison between NDErs and
people who had come close to death without an
NDE (Greyson,
1990).
The
instrument
has
proved useful in several applications (see,
e.g.,
Holden et
al.,
2009),
especially for identifying
such “True NDEs” from other respondent types.
That
said,
we acknowledge that
the term may
invoke unavoidable semantic associations
in
some readers; that is, truth and reality, a state of
affairs that is as it appears or is claimed to be.
This may imply to some that other experiences
are untrue or less true or meaningful. Therefore,
“True-NDE” should be understood as
being
equated with a “classic NDE” in an authentic or
consensual sense. Given this understanding, we
retain use of
the “True NDE” term here for
consistency with previous
studies
using the
NDE Scale.
Lange,
Greyson,
and Houran (2004) showed
that
NDE intensity,
as
defined by Greyson’s
NDE Scale,
satisfactorily fit
a Rasch (1960/
1980)
model,
thus
yielding a unidimensional
measure with interval-level
scaling properties.
With increasing intensity, NDEs were found to
reflect
peace,
joy,
and harmony,
followed by
insight
and mystical
or
religious experiences,
while
the
most
intense
NDEs
involved an
awareness
of
things
occurring in a different
place or
time.
By the very nature of
Rasch
scaling,
components
mentioned later
in this
NDE sequence become salient only after those
early in the sequence have already been re-
ported with considerable likelihood (cf.,
Bond
& Fox,
2007)—that
is,
the NDE components
identified by Greyson form an actual
cumula-
tive hierarchy.
The NDE Scale appears to cap-
ture a “NDE core experience” as it is invariant
across True-NDErs’ gender, current age, age at
time of NDE, as well as years elapsed since the
NDE and intensity of the NDE.
Under the as-
sumption that a similar hierarchy is reflected in
NDErs’
verbal
accounts of
their
experiences,
there should exist a relation between the quan-
titative NDE intensity and the qualitative NDE
content.
We note that the analytic technique to
be used,
latent semantic analysis (LSA),
is not
limited to linguistic information and other vari-
ables can simply be included as additional “fea-
tures.” In the present research we have access to
some
NDErs’
age
and gender
information.
Since people’s
vocabulary likely varies
with
their age and gender, thereby affecting the pre-
diction rules, we also conducted runs using age
and gender
as independent
variables (i.e.,
by
adding them as
predictors),
as
well
as
runs
where age and gender were treated as dependent
variables.
The present
research therefore aims to ex-
plore the applicability of
the NDE Scale in
providing concurrent
validity for NDE reports
(or
alternatively,
concurrent
validity for
the
scale itself) by providing a direct link between

NDErs’ verbal accounts, which are available in
written form,
and the intensity of their experi-
ences as expressed on Greyson’s (1983,
1985,
1990) NDE Scale. As an aside, we note that our
validation efforts by establishing a correlation
are best seen as addressing concurrent validity,
rather than predictive validity,
because the re-
porting of the experiences and the administra-
tion of
Greyson’s
NDE intensity measure
tended to occur in close temporal proximity. As
will
be explained in the following section,
we
use LSA to express verbal
accounts in a form
suitable
for
quantitative
analysis
(see,
e.g.,
Deerwester
et
al.,
1990;
Landauer,
Foltz,
&
Laham,
1998).
Once such narratives are repre-
sented in quantitative form,
standard statistical
techniques can be used to establish concurrent
validity.
Under
the assumption that
a similar
hierarchy of
experiential
components
is
re-
flected in NDErs’ verbal
accounts of their ex-
periences,
we specifically hypothesize that
a
significant
relation should exist
between NDE
intensity and NDE content.
No exact
match
between the items and NDErs’ accounts is re-
quired since LSA will recognize terms that are
(nearly)
synonymous.
Operationally,
this
im-
plies that
scores on the NDE Scale associated
with a particular NDE account can be predicted
from the meaning of their (free-format) written
accounts thereof. If so, in addition to supporting
concurrent
validity,
we will
have obtained a
system that is capable of capturing at least some
aspects of NDEs.
Using the terminology of
Schwartz et
al.
(2014), LSA provides an “open-vocabulary” ap-
proach that does not require a predefined set of
keywords.
Rather,
given a collection of
NDE
accounts,
relevant
words and word sequences
are
identified using unsupervised learning.
While this study research focuses on establish-
ing the concurrent validity of the NDE Scale, it
is also serves as a general case study of LSA as
a new tool
for establishing concurrent
validity
based on the use of qualitative verbal informa-
tion,
as well as an effective method for under-
standing subjective,
narrative-based data from
other aspects of psychiatry and social
science
(see,
e.g.,
Osborne,
1994).
Latent Semantic Analysis
LSA provides an effective method for knowl-
edge induction and representation by automat-
ing the process for determining the similarity of
meaning of words and passages of written text
(for an overview,
see Deerwester et al.,
1990).
Based on word and context
co-occurrences,
LSA represents the words, sentences, and para-
graphs used in it as points in a very high dimen-
sional
“semantic space” (for an overview,
see,
e.g.,
Landauer et al.,
1998).
Singular value de-
composition (SVD), a mathematical matrix de-
composition technique closely akin to factor
analysis,
is then used to simplify this space.
While SVD itself
has
long been known,
its
application became technically feasible only af-
ter the development of efficient computer algo-
rithms capable of dealing with large data sets.
LSA revolves around the concepts of
corpus,
tokens,
vector space,
and model.
A corpus is a
collection of
text
units
(e.g.,
typed answers,
word processer files, or web pages), called doc-
uments. The words in these documents define of
a series of tokens that represent useful aspects of
the answers’ semantics.
Tokens deemed useful
in a particular
application are gathered in a
dictionary, and words not in that dictionary are
simply ignored. For instance, the word “the” is
probably useless in most contexts and will not
appear in the dictionary.
The vector space ap-
proach
represents
documents’
tokens
as
sparsely coded vector features combined with
their
frequencies.
For
instance,
the sentence
“The soldier saw another soldier approaching”
might be represented as the token vector [(“sol-
dier,”2),
(“approaching,”1),
(“saw,”1)],
while
the word “the” is ignored. Word order plays no
role here, and the preceding is referred to as the
“bag of word” approach.
The vector space model assumes that similar
documents have similar vectors and that vector
similarity reflects similarity in meaning.
Expe-
rience indicates that
first
transforming tokens’
raw frequencies using a log entropy weighting
function supports these assumptions (see,
e.g.,
Manning & Schütze, 1999). In this approach, if
tf
ij
represents the number of times token i occurs
in document
j,
then each token i
receives
a
global weight g
i

(2)
The net effect of this approach is to reduce the
relative importance of
high frequency tokens,
while assigning higher
weights to tokens that
distinguish between different documents.
LSA proceeds
to decompose the weighted
document-by-token data matrix A into the prod-
uct of three matrices: an orthonormal document-
by-k matrix T,
a k

k diagonal
matrix of
singular-values s
ij
whose diagonal values are in
decreasing order (i.e., s

s

⫺

), and an
orthonormal
document-by-k
matrix D.
The
value of
k represents the number
of
singular
values in truncated versions of T, S, and D that
allows A to be reconstructed with acceptable
loss of information,
while reducing noise and
variability (Berry,
Dumais,
& O’Brien,
1995).

Although the optimal
number
of
factors will
vary between applications,
values of
k in the
range 100 –300 are typical
(Landauer,
2007).
LSA essentially reduces the size of the docu-
ment
vectors
by placing (near)
synonyms
at
similar
locations
in the k-dimensional
vector
space.
In this paper we take these reduced vectors as
our
basic units of
observation,
to be used as
input
for
further
analysis.
While LSA works
well in practice,
even for relatively small sam-
ples,
the factors it produces are typically diffi-
cult
to interpret.
Other
vector-based methods,
like latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA),
tend to be
superior in this respect (e.g., Blei, Ng, & Jordan,
2003).
However,
LDA also requires
a larger
corpus of cases than is available here.
Method
Data
The second author maintains an ongoing da-
tabase of NDE accounts provided personally by
those reporting NDEs.
Available for
analysis
were a total
of
863 such accounts,
some of
which constitute only a couple of paragraphs,
whereas others span 10 –20 typewritten pages.
On average, the accounts contain 224.90 tokens
(SD
⫽
146.98).
Scores
on Greyson’s
(1983,
1985, 1990) NDE Scale were also available for
588 of these NDE accounts. As was noted ear-
lier,
this
scale is
defined by 16 experiential
items derived from hundreds of NDE accounts.
Respondents rated each component in terms of
three ordered categories that generically repre-
sent
“not
present,”
“mildly or
ambiguously
present,” or
“definitively present,” but
whose
exact
wording varies with the nature of ques-
tions. Using the parameters listed in Lange et al.
(2004),
maximum likelihood estimates of
re-
spondents’
Rasch NDE intensity were com-
puted for each respondent (M
⫽ ⫺
0.17,
SD
⫽
1.34 logits) using the UCON method described
in Wright and Masters (1982). For 369 respon-
dents (48 men and 321 women) both age and
gender were known.
This subsample was used
for ancillary analyses.
Data Preparation
As
recommended by Berry and Browne
(2005),
the narratives were first
“purified” to
eliminate tokens providing little useful informa-
tion.
First,
to minimize the occurrence of spu-
rious tokens,
all
accounts were spell-checked
using Norvig’s (2007)
software,
and all
pro-
posed changes were verified manually before
being accepted. Also, words were normalized to
their
essential
roots
by a process
known as
stemming (Berry & Browne,
2005).
For exam-
ple,
and depending on the stemming method
being used,
the words “fishing,” “fished,” and
“fisher” would reduce to the root
“fish.” Such
stems need not be part of the (natural) language,
but stemming assumes that words with a com-
mon stem usually have strongly related mean-
ings. For instance, the words “argue,” “argued,”
and “argues” reduced to the stem “argu.” All
stemming operations are based on the widely
used Porter
algorithm,
as
is
included in the
Gensim (R
ˇ
ehu˚rˇek & Sojka,
2010) software.
The resulting tokens were all written in lower
case letters, with end-of-sentence markers (i.e.,
“!,” “?,” or “.”) denoted by “#.” Some concepts
are defined by a sequence of two words rather
than a
single
word (e.g.,
New York,
well-
defined).
To capture such cases,
all
possible
pairs
of
adjacent
elements
in a sentence,
or
bigrams,
were added as well.
The present cor-
pus was deemed too small to also use sequences

of
more than two words.
Finally,
tokens that
either
occurred very frequently (in more than
2/3 of all accounts) as well as tokens occurring
very infrequently (in fewer than five cases) were
omitted since these provide very little or very
unreliable information.
This last
condition re-
moved all

All LSA analyses reported here are based on
R

ehu˚rˇek and Sojka’s (2010)
versatile Gensim
system that

This
Python-based software contains libraries for

Results
A file was created with the 588 respondents’
scores on Greyson’s NDE Scale (when avail-
able), together with the coordinates of their ac-
counts
projected in a 400 dimensional
space
(see Method section).
These dimensions were
ordered according to their corresponding eigen-
values.
Using the glm procedure provided by
the R language, the first 50 coordinates, first 100
coordinates, and so on, incrementing by 50, up
to 400 were used to predict respondents’ Rasch
scaled NDE measures in Logits. The second and
third columns
of
Table 1 show the squared
multiple correlations for sets of coordinates of
varying sizes, as well as the adjusted R
2
, which
takes into account the number of predictor vari-
ables and the sample size.
By definition, using increasingly complex se-
mantic spaces adds predictive power,
as is in-
dicated by the fact
that
R
2
increases continu
-
ously
when
more
predictors
are
added.
However,
the adjusted R
2
values,
which take
into account
the number of predictors and the
sample size, reach a maximum value (i.e., 0.33)
for about 250 predictor variables, and this value
is perhaps a more appropriate estimate of the
quality of
prediction.
Yet,
the finding that
at
least
one-third of the variation in respondents’
quantitative Rasch NDE measures can be pre-
dicted from their
qualitative
NDE accounts
strongly supports our hypotheses.
Factor Interpretations
With 250 predictors in the multiple regres-
sion model, only the contributions of the seven
factors shown in Table 2 reach statistical
sig-
nificance at
p
⬍
.001.
This stringent
Type I
error level was used given the large number of
predictors.
Table 2’s columns list these factors
in extraction order,
that
is,
lower
numbered
factors explain more of the variance in the se-
mantic space than do those with higher ordinals.
Note that
the significant
factors cover
a wide
extraction range (i.e.,
4 –247),
indicating that
some of the “later” factors,
that is,
factors that
explain less
of
the variance in the semantic
space,
nevertheless contribute significantly to
prediction.
This interpretation is supported by
the finding that the correlation between variance
explained by the first
250 factors
and their
weights in the multiple regression equation is
essentially zero (r
⫽ ⫺
0.06).

SEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF NDES

As a guide to the factors’ interpretation, each
column in Table 3 lists the 20 tokens with the
highest absolute loadings among the 1,500 en-
tries in the dictionary. For simplicity, the exact
loadings are not shown. Rather, since the sign of
tokens’ loadings (i.e.,
either positive or nega-
tive) is arbitrary,
only the juxtaposition of the
top versus bottom parts of each column matters
for a factor’s interpretation.
It can be seen that
some of the factors broadly agree with findings
reported in earlier qualitative research.
For ex-
ample,
the “core NDE” Rasch hierarchy de-
scribed by Lange et
al.
(2004),
by its inherent
definition, focuses on many of the transcenden-
tal
and seemingly paranormal
components to
many NDE accounts.
Four of the seven major
linguistic factors (4,
7,
26,
49)
included such
themes, whereas the remaining three major lin-
guistic factors (38, 235, 247) tended to include
both vague and specific references to physio-
logical or environmental elements. It is interest-
ing that the esoteric and dramatic components to
NDEs
neither
fully defined nor
dominated
NDEs in these linguistic dimensions. However,
any further or detailed interpretation or deemed
relevance of the linguistic factors is hindered by
several
issues.
First,
the linguistic structures
outlined in Table 2 do not always immediately
or
obviously relate to the experiential
factors
previously mentioned in NDE literature.
Sec-
ond,
LSA strips all temporal relational infor-
mation from the data and,
consequently,
any
interpretation of
the descriptors
or
compo-
nents in terms of
their
potential
progressive
relationships is not
possible.
Stated simply,
the elements in Table 2 defy a coherent con-
ceptualization,
and little theoretical

can be inferred from the empirical patterns at
this time.
Age and Gender as Predictors
For
369 respondents
(321 women and 48
men) both age and gender were known as well.
The fourth and fifth columns in Table 1 show
the multiple correlations
when the preceding
analyses are repeated,
but with these two vari-
ables included. As before, R
2
increases as more
factors are included, rising to 0.96 when the first
350 factors, plus gender and age, are used. Note,
however,
that
the number of predictors almost
equals the sample size and hence the adjusted
value
drops
precipitously.
The
adjusted R
2
again reaches a maximum for 250 factors, plus
gender
and age.
For
that
case,
the explained
variance increases by 6% (i.e.,
33 vs.
39%).
However,
due to the smaller sample size,
and
perhaps selection factors,
all
other adjusted R
2
values are lower than before. We conclude that
gender and age improves prediction, but only in
combination with an optimal
selection of
the
number of semantic factors.
Predicting Gender and Age
It can conversely be asked whether the gen-
der and age for the 369 individuals’ complete
cases (321 women and 48 men) can be predicted
from their verbal NDE accounts—that is, treat-
ing age and gender
as
dependent
variables.
First,
using a variety of approaches,
including
linear regression, logistic regression, and dis-
criminant
analysis,
no reliable method could
be identified to predict
gender
from the se-
mantic factors,
regardless of
the number
of
factors being used.
For
instance,
linear
and
quadratic discriminant
analysis both only al-
lowed the correct
classification of 323 cases,
or 88%,
which hardly improves the baseline
value of
87% correct
classification (i.e.,
the
percentage of women).
Age,
by contrast,
could be predicted with
considerable accuracy.
Table 3 shows the R
2
obtained from multiple
regression,
together
with their
adjusted values,
across
a varying
numbers of
predictor
factors being used.
The
analyses were repeated with and without using
gender as a predictor and the results are shown
in columns 4 and 5,
and 2 and 3,
respectively.
By definition,
R
2
increases with the number of
predictors,
but unlike the results in Table 1,
so
does the adjusted R
2
.
Settling this issue proba
-
bly requires larger samples of observations, but
if (as in the prediction of NDE intensity) we use
the first 250 factors, then about a quarter of the
age variation can be explained by the semantic
factors.
We note that
including gender
as
a
predictor consistently has only minimal effects
on the adjusted R
2
and this variable can thus be
ignored.
True NDEs
We noted earlier that a raw sum of 7 or higher
on the NDE items is used as a criterion for
labeling respondents’
experiences
as
a “True
NDE” versus other experiences.
Based on this
rule,
523 of
the 588 (87%)
respondents with
NDE scale data were classified as True NDErs.
This classification was difficult
to predict.
For
instance,
logistic regression in the R program-
ming language using the first
250 factors as
predictors, did not converge. Also, standard lin-
ear
regression to predict
NDE categorization
failed to reach statistical
significance (R
2
⫽
0.41,
F(250,
282)
⬍
1.0),
and the results are
nonsensical
when adjusted for
the number
of
variables and sample size (R
2
⫽ ⫺
0.11).
Not surprising in light of the overall predict-
ability of NDE intensity,
when the NDErs are
divided into two (nearly) equal groups based on
their median NDE scores,
classification is suc-
cessful.
In particular,
the support
vector
ma-
chine method, as embodied in R package e1071
(Karatzoglou,
Meyer,
& Hornik,
2006),
can
identify low versus
high scoring individuals
with 64% accuracy using 10-fold validation
(i.e.,
against a baseline of 50%).
Discussion
The findings strongly support the concurrent
validity of Greyson’s (1983,
1985,
1990) NDE
Scale by confirming our basic hypothesis that
the intensity of NDErs’ experiences can be pre-
dicted from their written subjective accounts, as
captured quantitatively using LSA.
This state-
ment
summarizes a complex chain of
events
that
starts
from the
assumption
that
co-
occurring words share a similar meaning.
The
complexity of this approach is reduced through
SVD,
which assigns to arbitrary collections of
words a location in a semantic space.
These
spatial coordinates were then successfully used
85

as predictor variables for statistical
correlation
and prediction.
While we phrased the findings
as
contributing to the concurrent
validity of
Greyson’s NDE measure,
it
could be argued
that
one might
also conclude that
the findings
support
the validity of
the LSA approach,
or
offer
concurrent
validity for
certain NDE ac-
counts, based on their correlation with the NDE
measure.
The issue constitutes a “chicken and
egg” problem since Greyson derived his ques-
tionnaire items from accounts and interviews
with people who reported NDE-like experi-
ences. Thus, verbal data are the primary source
of information, and the NDE Scale can be seen
as a secondary encapsulation thereof.
We sug-
gest that either interpretation is valid.
It
is important
to note that
our
results are
open-vocabulary,
that
is,
they do not
require a
predefined set of NDE keywords with a known
correspondence to NDE intensity or other vari-
ables.
Rather,
except for some basic rules con-
cerning word occurrence, unsupervised learning
proved successful in creating a useful semantic
space of NDE’s cognitive,
affective,
transcen-
dental,
and paranormal components.
Currently,
once computed for a collection of accounts, this
space is static since its structure remains fixed
even though new accounts become available.
However,
if
updating the semantic space as
more accounts become available proves useful,
the Gensim software (R
ˇ
ehu˚rˇek & Sojka,
2010)
can also do this.
Although we have achieved a useful
encod-
ing of NDE accounts that predicts NDE inten-
sity and percipient
age,
it
is legitimate to ask
what exactly has been learned. First, the seman-
tic space contained factors that summarize some
of the basic themes of NDErs’ phenomenology,
including physical
and environmental
factors,
as well
as more esoteric and dramatic percep-
tions of interest
to transpersonal
and humanis-
tic-oriented psychologies.
Thus,
our
findings
validate earlier research on the robustness of a
core NDE (for a review, see Holden et al., 2009;
cf., Lange et al., 2004). Nevertheless, follow-up
research is
needed to meticulously scrutinize
our present results in terms of several compet-
ing models (for
reviews,
see Greyson,
2001;
Greyson et al., 2009; Holden et al., 2009; Perera
et al.,
2001):
•
Sabom (1981) categorized NDEs as auto-
scopic,
transcendental,
combined (having
both autoscopic
and transcendental
fea-
tures),
or
non-NDEs
(having features
of
neither autoscopic nor transcendental
fea-
tures
and therefore
not
qualifying as
NDEs);
•
Emotionally pleasant,
neutral,
or unpleas-
ant NDEs;
•
NDEs precipitated by cardiac arrest,
or by
accident,
or by anesthesia/drugs,
or by no
known precipitant.
It
has been suggested
that there are five phenomenological clus-
ters of
NDEs,
linked to low stress,
emo-
tional
stress,
intoxicants,
anesthetics,
and
cardiac arrest;
•
Proximity to death (e.g., loss of vital signs;
seriously ill or injured but without loss of
vital signs; or not seriously ill or injured).
Additional insights for theory-building might
be obtained in this way, as well as new hypoth-
eses amenable to LSA approaches.
We plan to
pursue this avenue in future research. Second,
LSA knowledge
is
declarative
rather
than
procedural,
and it is best seen as “semantic,”
that is,
the SVD generated space resembles a
generalized record of facts and meanings con-
cerning reality.
In a different
context,
Lan-
dauer et al.
(1998) argued that LSA offers an
approximation to human knowledge in a spec-
ified cognitive
domain and they observed
that:
One might consider LSA’s maximal knowledge of the
world to be analogous to a well-read nun’s knowledge
of sex, a level of knowledge often deemed a sufficient
basis for advising the young (p.
262).
Not unlike the clinical impact NDEs can have
on percipients’ every day attitudes and experi-
ences observed by Lukoff and colleagues (Lu-
koff
et
al.,
1998;
Turner
et
al.,
1995),
we
showed earlier (Lange et
al.,
2004) that
NDEs
have the power to restructure people’s cogni-
tions by reprioritizing the items they deem rel-
evant. This fact is also reflected in our semantic
space,
since it
proved possible to distinguish
reliably between individuals
with low versus
high scores on Greyson’s NDE Scale. Our find-
ings indicate that
NDEs appear to have an in-
herent
predictable structure that
represents
a
distinct
state of consciousness worthy of con-
tinued study.
Academia merely has NDE re-
ports to analyze rather than the direct physical
experiences
themselves.
Therefore,
new per-
spectives and research avenues like LSA hold
promise for
the development
of
more highly

integrated multidisciplinary research on the
NDE question.
The
authors,
therefore,
seek
cross-cultural
collaborations
to advance
re-
search in this area using more and varied data-
sets to properly test the generalizability of these
results.
We believe that
the present
research is only
the beginning of
many other
research efforts
across
various
phenomena
in consciousness
studies. For instance, while LSA is certainly the
most
widely used for
computerized linguistic
analysis,
it
certainly seems worthwhile to try
other
computational
approaches
as
well.
As
noted earlier,
this
will
probably require the
availability of larger datasets than the present
one.
We caution,
however,
that different cul-
tures express similar
phenomena in qualita-
tively
different
and
idiosyncratic
ways,
thereby complicating prediction and analysis
in general (for examples,
see Belanti,
Perera,
& Jagadheesan,
2008;
Lange,
Thalbourne,
Houran,
& Lester,
2002).
In extreme cases,
cultural differences entail the use of different
languages (with their own grammar and vo-
cabularies)
as
well.
However,
analogous
to
our use of age and gender,
in all cases where
the same language is used across subgroups,
we suggest
that
cultural
factors are included
together with linguistic data in order to define
an optimal
semantic space.
Most
importantly,
this paper demonstrated
how a novel
methodology can enhance our
understanding of
human experiences
where
data typically consists of verbal accounts. We
strongly expect
that
the approach will
prove
fruitful
in applications besides NDE.
For ex-
ample,
it
seems possible that
LSA or related
approaches could be used to assess the verac-
ity of
verbal
accounts—a
topic
that
could
perhaps be studied by contrasting reliable ac-
counts
with “fabricated” ones
produced by
knowledgeable collaborators.
Once authentic
or consensual
accounts are identified,
further
LSA analyses
on these
screened accounts
might
reveal
patterns
relevant
to
theory-
building for the phenomena in question.
The
range of
potential
topics
is
vast,
including
dreaming and lucid dreaming, meditation, and
other internal attention states, out-of-body ex-
periences,
dissociative,
transliminal,
halluci-
natory,
and delusionary episodes,
as well
as
spontaneous case material
(historic and con-
temporary) across the disciplines of abnormal
and
transpersonal
psychologies.
Alterna-
tively,
researchers
might
gather
written (or
other
free-response)
information in applica-
tions
where this
is
typically not
done.
For
example,
the study of interpretations of am-
biguous stimuli,
including putative parapsy-
chological
experiences,
might
benefit
greatly
from augmenting quantitative
measures
of
paranormal
belief and experience (Lange,
Ir-
win,
& Houran,
2000;
Irwin & Marks,
2013)
with qualitative verbal accounts.
Another ob-
vious and rich area for potential application is
accounts of syncretic cognitions,
involving a
dedifferentiation (or
fusion)
of
perceptual
qualities
in subjective
experience
such as:
physiognomic perception (fusion of
percep-
tion and feeling),
synesthesia (fusion of sen-
sory modalities),
and eidetic imagery (fusion
of imagery and perception,
i.e.,
structural
ei-
detic imagery).
We propose that LSA and related approaches
provide a flexible and powerful operationaliza-
tion of an interactionist framework that encom-
passes a mixture of self-attribution and stimu-
lus-attribution variables
when individuals
perceive,
remember,
and later articulate anom-
alous experiences.
This could be done,
for in-
stance, by analyzing different phenomena using
a common semantic space.
As such,
the ap-
proach outline here promises to provide a pow-
erful
unifying quantitative framework for
the
integration of what
currently appear to be dis-
joint and qualitatively different phenomena.
