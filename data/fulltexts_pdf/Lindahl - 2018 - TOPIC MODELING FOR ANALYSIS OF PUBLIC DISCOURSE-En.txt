Abstract
This work investigates how the method of topic modeling can be applied to investigate the public dis-
course of Swedish housing policies.
The data used to represent this discourse is both from the Swedish
parliament, the Riksdag, and Swedish newstexts.
The lack of housing and current housing crisis in Swe-
den makes this a relevant area to study.
Topic modeling is an unsupervised probabilistic method for
finding topics in large collections of data. This is a popular method for examining public discourse, how-
ever there is a lack of including linguistic information in the preprocessing steps of it.
Therefore,
this
work also investigates what effect linguistically informed preprocessing has on topic modeling.
Three types of linguistic information are selected and investigated. These are part of speech, dependency
relations and lemmatization.
Based on these, filters are created for the data.
The filters are applied to a
test set (a subset of the original data),
and a topic model is trained on each filtered version of this test
set.
The resulting topics from each model are evaluated by both humans and the computational methods
perplexity and semantic coherence, and the results from the respective evaluation methods are compared.
The semantic coherence named
cv
is found to have a higher correlation with human ratings than the
npm
i
coherence.
Perplexity is found to not correlate well with human ratings.
Filtering the data based on part of speech is found to most improve the topic quality.
Non-lemmatized
topics are found to be rated higher than lemmatized topics.
Topics from the filters based on dependency
relations are found to have low ratings.
Based on the human ratings,
an optimum model for respective data set is chosen.
The selected topic
models are applied to the data, and the results are used for to exemplify how one can use them for analysis.
Topic modeling is found to be a suitable method for the intended analysis.

Introduction
Arguably everyone in Sweden has an opinion about the housing market and policies. It has been a source
of debate for a long time, and considering there has been a housing crisis ongoing since the 1990’s, this
is not surprising. Lack of housing is still becoming more widespread, and with only a small rise in newly
built houses in 2015–2016 (Höjer, 2017) one can wonder what this debate has contributed.
With this in
mind,
the starting point of the present work was a call from the Swedish union of tenants (Hyresgäst-
föreningen) asking for language technology methods for analyzing the housing policies discourse.
In recent years we have seen the emergence of many new techniques for analyzing the constantly increas-
ing flow of information and data.
Methods for automatically extracting topics, topic modeling, machine
learning for sentiment analysis and information extraction are a few of them.
In the field of humanities and social sciences the use of computational methods has been argued for by
many.
Sometimes referred to as ”Digital Humanities”, the importance of tools for investigation of both
digital and printed texts is undeniable.
However, as Viklund & Borin (2016) argue, these techniques still
need refinement and development to be both accessible and more useful. Often, the linguistic information
is disregarded, and there is a need to explore what incorporating this can do for the field.
This issue is
also raised by Tahmasebi et al. (2015), where the concept of culturomics is discussed, and the need for
good linguistic preprocessing to make this a successful field.
This is especially important with respect to
language specificity.
Most tools are developed and tested on English, and this doesn’t always translate
well to other languages.
Therefore,
the aim of the present work is twofold.
The first is to exemplify and explore how one can
apply language technology to investigate the public discourse of the Swedish housing policies.
More
specifically, the method of topic modeling is chosen to explore the discourse. The second is to investigate
how one can adapt and enrich this method with linguistic information, especially with Swedish in mind.
To explore the discourse, the questions asked are:
•
How have people been talking about housing policies?
•
How has this varied over time?
To represent this discourse, data from both the Swedish parliament and newstexts is used.
These areas
are two important parts of the public discourse of housing policies.
The documents and records from the
Swedish parliament is a natural place to look for information on housing policies, and are available over a
long span of time.
The newstexts were selected on the basis of them containing one or more words from
a list of keywords relating to Swedish housing policies.
This was done in order to find the newstexts
concerning housing policies.
To answer the above questions about
the public discourse,
the method of topic modeling is used,
as
mentioned above.
Topic modeling has proved a successful method in a wide range of areas for finding
structure and topics in large quantities of text.
For example, Hall et al. (2008) use it to study ideas within
the computational semantics field over time,
DiMaggio et al. (2013) investigate the news coverage of
U.S. arts funding and Jacobi et al. (2016) use it for analysis of journalistic text.
However,
as McFarland et al. (2013),
in their study of language differentiation in academe,
point out:
”topic models require careful thought and revision if they are to be successfully applied to social science
research questions.” Mohr & Bogdanov (2013) also discuss the need for both knowledge of the method
1
and the field in question,
in order for the topic modeling to have a meaningful
outcome.
They also
mentioned the need for good linguistic preprocessing.
This brings us to the second aim and research question:
•
How is topic modeling affected by different kinds of preprocessing steps, based on linguistic in-
formation?
Here, preprocessing refers to the steps before the topic modeling, where one processes the data before
training a model on it. Preprocessing includes both formatting of the data, such as removing punctuation,
but it can also include removing all words of a certain part of speech. The latter is thus based on linguistic
information about the data.
Preprocessing is necessary when doing topic modeling, but there is no standard recipe for it and many
studies differ in their use of it.
The effect of different preprocessing choices has not been studied sys-
tematically.
There is also a lack of using linguistic information in the preprocessing.
Furthermore, most
of the topic modeling studies employ models which are trained on English.
Swedish, which has a richer
morphology than English, can be assumed to be more affected by lemmatizing, for example.
There are many kinds of linguistic information to incorporate and this work cannot examine them all.
The aim here is to examine the effect of three selected types of linguistic information and investigate if
there is a general effect to be expected from them.
The selected linguistic information is part of speech,
dependency relations and lemmatization. This information is used to create different preprocessing filters.
These filters are applied to a test set of the data, coming from the parliaments documents, which results
in different versions of the original data.
A topic model is trained on each version of this data.
The resulting models are evaluated,
to find how the filters affect the interpretability of the model and
which filters result in good models.
The evaluation is done by human participants.
Their evaluation is
compared to computational methods, to ensure the best model is chosen.
The highest rated model from
the test set is then used to explore the rest of the data from the parliament.
To explore the newstexts, the
filters from the five highest rated models from the parliaments documents are reused on a test set from
the newstexts,
resulting in five versions of the test set.
Five new models are trained and evaluated on
these test sets.
The highest rated model is used to explore the rest of the newstexts.
In both data sets, with the help of the selected model for each set, documents concerning housing policies
are identified.
The occurrence of these over time answer the question of how the housing policies has
varied.
To answer the question of how people have been talking about housing policies, the cooccurring
topics with the housing topics are identified.
The rest of the thesis is structured as follows.
In section 2,
previous research and topic modeling are
presented.
In section 3, the data is presented.
In section 4 the method is presented and in section 5 the
results.
In section 6 these results are discussed and in section 7 conclusion and future work is presented.

Background
This section is split in four parts.
The first gives a short introduction to the housing crisis in Sweden and
the second gives an explanation of the linguistic information used. The third explains how topic modeling
works and how it can be used. The fourth gives an overview of the use of topic modeling public discourse.
2.1
The housing crisis
According to the latest survey on the housing situation in Sweden, made by Boverket (2017),(the national
board of housing, building and planning), 255 out of 290 municipalities report a lack of housing.
This
is an increase of 72 municipalities in 2 years.
At the same time,
the population in Sweden is steadily
growing (SCB,
2017b),
with a prognosis of a historically unusually high growth in the coming years
(SCB, 2017a).
More houses are being built in recent years, but there has been a shortage for so long that it will take years
to fill the need.
Also, it is argued that even though houses are built, they are of the wrong kind.
They are
too expensive and too few.
The need for housing is the largest among socially vulnerable groups, which
are also the ones that will have the most difficulties finding the financial strength to buy housing (Höjer,
2017).
The reason and solutions for the crisis are naturally debated, but what is undeniable is the existence of it.
The aim here is to investigate the debate, not participate in the debate itself.
2.2
Linguistic information
The term
linguistic information
is very broad and can encompass many different things.
As mentioned
in the introduction, here the focus lies on three parts.
These are:
1.
Part of Speech
2.
Lemma
3.
Dependency relations
Part of speech (POS) is the most straight-forward of these, it refers to a word’s part of speech category.
This can be for example noun, verb or adjective.
Function words such as prepositions and pronouns are
other examples. Traditionally, nouns and verbs are considered to carry more meaning than function verbs.
This is important to consider when selecting words for the topic modeling.
A lemma is a word’s dictionary or base form. For example,
cat
is the lemma of
cats
and
walk
is the lemma
of
walking
.
The process of changing words into lemmas is called lemmatization.
To reduce all words in
a corpus to lemma can help when ones uses words statistics, because the number of words are reduced,
unless one’s interest lies in the specific word forms.
Lemmatization is presumably more effective in
languages with rich morphology.
Dependency relations refer to the syntactic relations between words in a sentence, as specified by a de-
pendency grammar.
These relations are called dependencies and they are binary asymmetrical relations.
A few of the possible grammatical relations can be seen in table 1 which also shows a parsed sentence.
The type of grammatical relations can vary depending on which dependency grammar is used.
Advan-
tages of dependency grammars includes a strong predictive power and easy handling of different word

orders.

Here,
dependency relations are used as a selection criteria for the

Topic modeling
Topic modeling is the general name for a group of usually probabilistic models that aim to automatically
discover topics in a data collection (Blei,
2012).
Often this data is collections of text documents,
but
there are also examples of topic modeling being used on other forms of discrete data, for example image
processing (Blei et al., 2010).
However, here only applications in natural language are discussed, that is,
topic modeling used for exploring collections of text.
A topic model builds on the assumption that there is a hidden set of topics in the data it models.
By
observing a collection of documents, it infers a number of topics.
To do this, the only information the
model needs is the distribution of words in the documents, and for most models, a number of topics to be
found.
Each topic is then represented as a probability distribution over words.
Table 2 shows an example of topics generated by a topic model trained on Swedish data, with translation.
These words have the highest probability in these topics.
By observing these words,
the topics in the
figure can be assumed to be about education and energy, respectively.
These labels needs to be provided
by a human annotator,
the topic model has no real world knowledge of what is a coherent topic.
The
structure that the topic model infers matches well with the structure of language and this results in topics
which we as humans infers as a coherent topic (Blei, 2012).

Table 2: Examples of topics from a topic model
Still, topic modeling is a powerful tool for to bringing structure to unstructured data.
Once a model has
been trained it can be used on new and old documents to find which topics each document contains. This
can be used for classification, prediction and information retrieval tasks, among others. Topic modeling is
advantageous because there is no need to label the data beforehand, it is a so called unsupervised method.
This is useful for exploration and analysis of big corpora or data sets, where one can use topic modeling to
to find topics and documents of interest and thus avoid having to manually go through the data. DiMaggio
et al. (2013) describe this use of topic modeling as a lens to view a corpus through.
In it simplest form, the distribution of words in documents is the only information a topic model needs, as
mentioned above. The model sees the documents as bags of words. This means that the syntactic structure
and other information is lost, but topic modeling manages to capture topics despite this.
However, there
are a number of extended and modified models, many which include more information about the data.
See section 2.3.2 for examples on this.
Training a topic model is a trial and error process.
A number of parameters is involved, and it is often
difficult to know exactly what effect a change in a certain parameter has on the results.
It would be a too
big scope to evaluate all of them, and therefore most studies settle on the default parameters of the chosen
toolkit or own script.
This is however something to keep in mind when employing topic modeling.
Perhaps the most important parameter when employing topic modeling is the number of topics.
There
is no universal number of topics, it depends on the data being modelled.
A more diverse set of data will
have more topics to be retrieved.
The number also depends on what is desired from the topics,
a low
number usually results in low granularity of the topics and vice versa (Jockers, 2013).
The most commonly used topic model is the probabilistic model Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which
is the model employed here.
Other topic models include hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), which is
similar to LDA but there is no need to specify the number of topics beforehand, and LSI, which can be
seen as predecessor to LDA.
2.3.1
Latent Dirichlet Allocation
LDA is a generative probabilistic model, and by explaining how it works one will also understand the
intuitions behind topic modeling.
LDA was developed by Blei et al. (2003), and builds upon ideas from
the earlier topic models,
such as probabilistic Latent semantic indexing (pLSI),
but seeks to improve
efficiency and modeling capabilities.
LDA assumes there is a number of hidden (or latent, hence the name) topics in the data, giving rise to the
observable data, which are the words in the provided corpus. Each document is seen as a random mixture
5
of topics, where each word belongs to a topic.
A topic is, as mentioned above, a probability distribution
over words. A word can only belong to one topic at a time, although it is possible for different occurrences
of the same word to belong to different topics.
As with most other topics models, the number of topics
needs to be provided when one trains an LDA model.
A classic way to illustrate and explain LDA is to describe the generative story of it. This is how the LDA
model assumes documents are created, and this story is used to infer the hidden topics. The idea is, in the
creation of every document, a random distribution of topics is chosen for that document.
This is done by
randomly drawing a probability distribution from a Dirichlet distribution.
The Dirichlet distribution is a
probability distribution over the space of multinomial distributions, here these multinomial distributions
are the topic probabilities.
The reason for using a Dirichlet distribution for the topics probabilities is that
the it makes the inference and approximation of parameters easier.
For a more detailed explanation see
(Blei et al., 2003).
To then produce a word in the document, a topic is randomly drawn from the topic distribution.
From
the drawn topic a word is drawn, at random.
This procedure is assumed to occur for every word in all the
documents.
Equation 1 shows the formal description of the generative process describe above, which is a joint prob-
ability distribution of the observed and hidden variables.
β
are the topics and every
β
k
is a distribution
over words from the vocabulary from the observed corpus.
θ
d
is the topic distribution over document
d
,
and
θ
d,k
is the proportion of topic
k
in document
d
. The topic assignments for document
d
are represented
by
z
d
, and
z
d,n
is the
n
th word in document
d
.
The observed words from document
d
are represented by
w
d
, and
w
d
n
is then the
n
th word in document
d
.

Using this equation topics can be inferred by observing their posterior distribution.
This is done by
calculating the conditional probability, which is defined as:
p = (β

1:D

p(w

)
(2)
where the numerator is the joint distribution.
The denominator represents the marginal probability of
the corpus,
the probability of the observed words in any possible instantiation of a topic model.
This
is impossible to compute, and therefore different methods for approximating it is used.
One of the most
commonly used methods for this is Gibbs sampling, where a Markov chain is used to construct dependent
variables, with the posterior distribution used as a limiting distribution.
Samples are collected from this
distribution to approximate the posterior.
Another commonly used method is variational Bayes, where
the problem is turned into an optimization problem.
This is done by specifying a number of distributions
for the hidden structure and then finding the distribution that is most similar to the posterior (Blei, 2012).
The implementation here uses a modified version of variational Bayes, made to handle documents in a
stream, which makes handling large corpora more effective (Hoffman et al., 2010).
It should be noted that topics from an LDA model will differ slightly every time the model is trained
on a data set.
That is, different models trained on the same data will differ slightly.
This could result in
topics from different models not having the exact same composition of words.
This is because some of
the parameters during inference are initialized randomly, and will thus produce slightly different results.
6
This should however not be a problem if one has developed a good model or, as is usually the case, intends
on using a single model for one’s dataset and not multiple models.
But of course it limits reproducibility.
A possible solution is to set these random parameters to a fixed value.
This is however not used here.
2.3.2
Linguistic extensions of LDA and preprocessing
In the original LDA paper,
many possibilities for extensions of LDA are discussed (Blei et al., 2003).
This includes incorporating more linguistic information from the data, such as relaxing the bag of words
assumption in order to include syntactic information. From a linguistic perspective this is certainly desir-
able.
Indeed, since the publication of that paper there has been many extensions and modifications like
this, aiming to improve the modeling or find new uses for it.
An early example of incorporating syntactic structure is done by Griffiths et al. (2005).
They create a
model where words are generated either from syntactic class or semantic theme (topic).
That is, a word
has either function or content,
and the result is both classes and themes (topics).
Boyd-Graber & Blei
(2009) create the
Syntactic topic model
which adds a syntactic component to the generative process and
training the model on parse trees, and the result is topics that has both semantic and syntactic coherence
(for example nouns about news), instead of having separate classes for function and content.
There are also many attempts at creating topic models for POS-tagging or dependency parsing.
Darling
et
al.
(2012) use a topic model
similar to LDA to discover part
of speech specific topics,
to use for
part of speech tagging.
Delpisheh & An (2014) use dependency relations to improve the bag of words
assumption.
However, above examples extend the original generative model of LDA. Often this is done in order to
widen the uses of the topic model, for example for part of speech tagging. In this work the focus is instead
on the preprocessing of the data, before LDA is applied to it.
The motivation for this is that there are few
studies on what effect different linguistic data and preprocessing steps has on the topic modeling and the
information sought from it.
In general, the preprocessing steps of topic modeling include removing punctuation, upper-case letters and
words from a stop list. This list can be assembled in various ways based on the most frequently occurring
words, either from the data or a reference corpus.
Contractions can also be expanded.
Preprocessing can
also include removing certain parts of speech. These preprocessing steps are usually not very thoroughly
described,
and often not included at all.
They also differ between studies.
An example of this is that
some studies use lemmatized corpora and while others don’t.
As with the number of topics, it seems that
whatever combination that gives the best topic model is chosen, by trial and error.
Or, no trial is done
and a default set of preprocessing steps are chosen.
There are a few studies reporting on the effect of linguistically informed topics modeling.
In the study
by Martin & Johnson (2015) they conclude that topic modeling is more informative and effective using
only nouns. Following Lau et al. (2014) they also report that lemmatizing improves the results, but it also
slows down the topic modeling.
They use semantic coherence for evaluation (see the next section) and
find that the coherence of the topics improve using nouns only.
Jockers (2013) also reports good results
for nouns only, but comments that using only nouns can remove some of the information sought after. For
example, he argues that if one is looking for sentiment, adjectives are probably necessary to incorporate.
Fang et al. (2012) present a novel cross-perspective topic model which models topics
and
opinions.
The
topics are also modelled using only nouns from the corpora. The opinions related to the topics are modeled
using adjectives, adverbs and verbs.
In this study part of speech plays a big role.
7
Guo (2012) uses dependency parsing relations to filter words as a preprocessing step for LDA, and reports
improved result for their specific task of detecting spoilers.
This,
together with the mentioned studies
above, further motivates an investigation of how topic modeling can be improved by filtering the input in
different ways, based on linguistic information. It is interesting both from an information retrieval aspect
and a purely linguistic aspect,
because it can have an effect on both the information and the linguistic
data in the resulting topics.
2.3.3
Evaluation of topic models
As with any kind of machine learning, evaluation is an important part of employing topic models.
Since
there is no gold standard for topic models and the optimum number of topics and other configurations
vary depending on the data being modeled, this is especially important.
Choosing a suitable model with
the right number of topics is not straightforward and many approaches have been suggested, and there is
currently no consensus of what the best method is.
There are two approaches one can choose when evaluating a topic model,
one can either evaluate the
model’s predictability or one can evaluate the topics produced by the model.
If the model is used for
classification the predictability of the model is important, but if the model will be used for corpus explo-
ration, the quality of the topics might be more important. Often it is the case that both of these approaches
are used.
To test the predictability of a model, the model is run on a held out test set.
The goal is to have a model
that has a high likelihood on the test set.
In the original LDA paper Blei et al. (2003) use perplexity per
word as a measure to evaluate the model.
The intuition behind perplexity is to see how many times the
model needs to guess before it gets it right.
The perplexity is calculated as the inverse of the probability
of the held out set, and the per word perplexity is calculated by dividing the perplexity by the number of
words in the held out set, as defined in equation 3 where M is the number of documents.
perplexity(D
test
) = exp
(
−
P
M
d=1
log p(w
d
)
P
M
d=1
N

)
(3)
However, in the often cited paper by Chang et al. (2009) perplexity and predictability are shown not to
correlate well with human judgements of the topics produced by a model.
Because of this, Chang et al.
(2009) argue for evaluation methods focusing on topic quality instead of model predictability.
In order
to evaluate topic quality, they focus on the interpretability of a topic. To do this, they create two different
tasks for humans to consider; word intrusion and topic intrusion.
In word intrusion, an outsider word is
inserted in the list of words representing a topic. If the intruder word is easily identified as not belonging,
the topic can be considered coherent and therefore interpretable.
In topic intrusion, the beginning of a
document is shown (it can be considered representative for the whole document according to the authors)
together with a list of four topics. Three of these are the topics with highest probability for the document,
last one is a topic is chosen randomly.
Similar to the word intrusion task, if the intruder topic is easily
identified the model is good at assigning topics.
When it comes to evaluating the interpretability of a topic it is natural to use human judgements, as exem-
plified above.
But, using humans takes time and resources.
To make the evaluation more efficient, there
have been many attempts to automatically evaluate topic quality,
usually by calculating the coherence
between the top n words in a topic.
In general, the basis for automatically estimating word coherence is
using word co-occurrences statistics. There are other knowledge-based methods using Wordnet or similar
resources, but they are found not to be as good as the former (Newman et al., 2010).
8
Röder et al. (2015) evaluate a number of coherence measures based on word co-occurrence statistics by
comparing them to human judgements.
They create a framework for comparing and combining these
measures, where the framework is a pipeline which consists of four dimensions or parameters for calcu-
lating the coherence.
The first part of the pipeline is segmentation,
how one chooses to segment the words for comparison.
It is for example possible to compare every word in a topic,
or only compare a word to the preceding
and following word,
or variations of both.
The second part is how to estimate the probabilities of the
words one compares.
The probability of the words can be defined as dividing the number of documents
the words co-occur in with the number of documents in total.
Variations of this is also possible, using a
sentence or paragraph as a document.
Or, the documents can instead be replaced with sliding windows
of a specific number of words, where the window slides over the document, one word at a time.
The third step in the pipeline is how one compares how words condition the occurrence of each other.
Lastly, the fourth variable is how to aggregate the set of confirmation values for each word-pair or word-
subset.
An example of this is arithmetic mean.
In the end,
a numeric value is produced representing
the coherence for a given number of words,
representing a topic.
For more details about the different
configurations of the coherence measures see Röder et al. (2015).
Following Newman et al. (2010) and Lau et al. (2014), Röder et al. (2015) compare the correlation be-
tween the coherence measures and human judgements.
The human judgements are taken from previous
research, were participants are asked to assess the usefulness or coherence of a topic by giving it a score
on scale between 1 ( = useless) and 3 ( = useful).
As a reference corpus for the word counts both the
original corpus and wikipedia is tested.
The correlation is then calculated using Pearson’s r.
A new combination of the existing coherence measures, named
cv
, is found to be the best with a mean
correlation of 0.731.
Using wikipedia as a reference corpus is also found to improve the results.
Inter-
estingly, these results differ from the results in van der Zwaan et al. (2016) where instead the coherence
measure named
npmi
is found to be the best. They also report low correlation for
cv
and lower correlation
overall.
The topic modeling in van der Zwaan et al. (2016) is on Dutch, and this could be the reason for
the different results.
However, despite the performance of computational methods, using human judgment one way or another
is still used.
It is also needed in many cases.
One cannot blindly accept the computational methods (yet).
When evaluating topics, as a means to evaluate computational methods or just for evaluation of a model,
the coherence or the interpretability of a topic is usually what is asked for.
What this means at a higher
level is a discussion that has to be left out here, but a few comments are needed.
The opinion of interpretability or coherence of a topic can differ between evaluators, and sometimes the
words of a topic can capture something, but it is hard to put a label on it. Different evaluators will certainly
have different labels for some topics.
As emphasized by DiMaggio et al. (2013) and McFarland et al.
(2013) knowledge of the domain is also important when evaluating topics, because otherwise meaningful
topics might be lost.
However, the need for expert knowledge depends on the domain.
DiMaggio et al. (2013) further discuss the relevance of the topic model and how to select an appropriate
one.
Rather than settling on one model to describe the data, they describe the process of finding a good
model as quoted below.
Think of the model as a lens for viewing a corpus of documents.
Finding the right lens is
different than evaluating a statistical model based on a population sample. The point is not to
estimate population parameters correctly, but to identify the lens through which one can see
9
the data most clearly.
Just as different lenses may be more appropriate for long-distance or
middle- range vision, different models may be more appropriate depending on the analyst’s
substantive focus.
(DiMaggio et al., 2013, 582)
Thus it is not only about finding an optimal model, it is also important to find a relevant model.
This is
related to the number of topics,
which has an effect on the topics, but it is also a discussion of what a
relevant topic is.
Note that when evaluating topics there are usually a couple of topics which are useless.
As argued by
Jockers (2013), this should not limit the use of the topics that are useful.
But of course a model with a
larger number of useful topics is to be preferred.
Human evaluation is also important to make sure that the topic model correctly assigns the documents
with appropriate topics, something that is currently best done with human judgements.
When manually
evaluating and exploring a model, visualizing the results beyond word lists can be an effective aid.
It is
used for example in McFarland et al. (2013).
Here different visualization plots are used for exploring the
data after classifying it.
Lastly, a note about model stability. As previously mentioned, LDA models produce slightly or more than
slightly different topics each run, and sometimes it is not always the same topics that emerge.
Wilkerson
& Casas (2017) discuss this and criticize the aim to find one good model.
To solve this they present a
framework which aggregates the result of several runs of the same model. Here results are not aggregated
but compared, but the issue of robustness is be adressed.
2.4
Topic modeling of public discourse
Topic modeling has been argued for by many as a means to explore, label and structure data in the social
sciences and humanities.
Many frameworks have been suggested to enable easier access to topic model-
ing.
However it is not until recent years that the researchers in the mentioned fields have begun to catch
on, considering that the original LDA paper came out in 2003.
An early example of topic modeling being used is done by Hall et al. (2008).
In their study they model
trends in the field of computational linguistics between 1978 - 2001 by using LDA on ACL anthology
papers.
They successfully use the topics, but there is no mention of preprocessing or evaluation method,
except that the topics where chosen manually.
Topic modeling has also been used for differentiating
language usage (McFarland et al., 2013) and to study sub-corpora to find important passages (Tangherlini
& Leonard, 2013).
In both of these, the evaluation is done manually and a stop list is used.
Public discourse has been a common subject for topic modeling.
Both formal and informal domains
have been investigated, these include legal documents or blogs.
Topic modeling is used by DiMaggio
et al. (2013) for studying newspaper coverage of the US government arts funding.
They argue for the
usefulness of topic modeling for this purpose,
and as discussed above emphasize the need for expert
evaluation.
More recent
examples of topic models being used is the examining of discussions in an
internet mental health support group (Carron-Arthur et al., 2016), the analyzing of judgments of the High
Court of Australia from 1903 to 2015 (Carter et al., 2016), and topic modeling crime reports (Kuang et al.,
2017).
Jacobi et al. (2016) also argue for LDA as useful tool for following trends in journalistic papers.
A very relevant study for this work is by Hägglöf (2014).
The purpose of her work is to do a pilot study
for automatical organization of online Swedish political discourse by testing two different topic modeling
methods, LDA and temporal chi-squared(
X
2
).
Data from the Swedish Riksdag is used also used in the
10
study, however more document types are used in the present work. Two other corpora of social media and
newstexts are also used.
The 200 most frequent words are removed from the corpus, as are words which
only occur once.
Punctuation and verbs are also removed.
Training the LDA model, different numbers
of topics are used and it is concluded that LDA is not a successful model for public discourse, something
the results in this work contradict.
The evaluation is done manually, by creating gold standards for one of the corpora, the Riksdag. There is
a problem with this, because manually creating gold standards before training the model requires knowl-
edge of what topics there are in the corpus.
The result of creating gold standards will rather be which
topics one
expects
in to be in the corpus.
The granularity of the topics is also an issue.
In the examples
provided,
labor policy
and
youth
are two examples of gold standard topics.
How should one know what
granularity one should choose for the topics? The topic model might come up with a topic such as ”youth
unemployment”.
This topic would be wrong according to the gold standard, but possibly correctly clas-
sify a document.
This means that one still has to manually do the evaluation,
in order to compare the
topics and the document being classified.
Table 3 shows a summary of the mentioned studies, to demonstrate the versatility of topic modeling, but
also some of the factors that need to be taken into account when doing topic modeling.
The prominence
of LDA can also be observed.
Although this is by no means an exhaustive list over all the studies which
uses topic modeling, it justifies using LDA for the purposes of this work.
It also show the general lack
pf preprocessing, or at least the reporting of preprocessing.

Data
The data used here is the Swedish parliament documents and newstexts from Swedish journals and news-
papers.
The parliament data can be downloaded online, but it is also available through Korp, the corpus
infrastructure tool of Språkbanken.
There, the data has been enriched with automatic linguistic annota-
tions, see section 3.3.
This version of the data is used in this thesis.
The newstexts are not available in
Korp and are thus not annotated beforehand. To annotate this data, the tool Sparv is used, see section 3.3.
This is the same tool that is used to annotate the Korp data.
3.1
The Swedish Riksdag data
All the documents and records from the Riksdag proceedings and correspondence are freely available
online, known as
Riksdagens öppna data
(The Parliament open data).
3
They span between 1971 to present
day, with the exception of a few document categories missing from the earlier years.
From around 1990
the documents are born digital,
before that they were digitalized using OCR.
This may lead to some
inaccuracies and misspellings in the text.
There are 20 different document categories,
see Appendix A for the full list.
From these,
seven were
chosen.
In order to motivate why these were chosen, the next section gives a brief overview of the work
of the Riksdag.
3.1.1
The Swedish Riksdag
Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. The King of Sweden is the head of
state, although his role is only representative. Instead, the Riksdag is the highest decision-making assem-
bly.
The role of the Riksdag is to make laws, determine the central budget and control the government.
In addition to these main duties, the Riksdag also has other responsibilities.
The Riksdag monitors the
work of the public sector and the EU-work, follows up on the scientific progress and work with foreign
policies (Bäck et al., 2015)(Regeringen, 2017).
The Riksdag is chosen by the Swedish citizens in general elections.
In practice, this is done through a
party system, where citizens vote for political parties and their candidates to be part of the parliament.
General elections are held every forth year on the second Sunday in September.
Between 1970 and 1994
the parliamentary period was instead 3 years. On the same day elections for county and municipal council
are also held. Everyone who is a Swedish citizen, over 18 and have been registered as a resident in Sweden
are eligible to vote (Riksdagen, 2017b) (Riksdagen, 2017d).
After an election, the seats in the Riksdag are distributed. The parliament has 349 seats which are assigned
proportionally to representatives of the political parties according to the number of votes.
In order to be
eligible for a seat in the parliament a party needs to obtain at least 4% of the votes. The Riksdag then votes
for a Speaker of the parliament who proposes a new Prime minister.
If the Prime minister is accepted he
or she is then allowed to form a Government (Riksdagen, 2017c).
The working year of the Riksdag starts in September each year with an opening meeting, the Riksmöte,
and ends the following year. The main work of the Riksdag is carried out in the Chamber, where meetings
are held and decisions are made related to all the matters listed above.
The Chamber is also the arena for
political debates, questionings and foreign policies debates. The Chamber is also room for other kinds of
3
https://data.riksdagen.se/data/dokument/
13
debates, as well as the annual budget debate and debates on EU affairs.
The decisions made primarily concern the changing of laws or the forming of new ones, taxes and how
these should be distributed and used.
In order to process and prepare for these decisions, the parliament
is divided in committees which each are in charge of different policy areas. There are both temporary and
permanent committees.
The committee are made up by the members of the parliament, proportionally to
their respective parties seats in the parliament.
The proposals for new legislation or decisions come in two forms, either submitted by a member of the
Riksdag, known as a
motion
or as Government bill, a
proposition
. A proposal can also come from bodies
appointed by the Riksdag.
The
propositions
are long,
thorough proposals.
They are usually preceded
by an report/investigation by an Government-appointed commission of inquiry.
The reports are known
as
statens offentliga utredningar (SOU)
. The
motions
are handed in during a special period of time each
year, the
allmänna motionstiden
or in relation to an already made proposition.
They can be written by
a single member of the Riksdag or a group.
Each year,
about 3000-4000
motions
are handed in,
and
although only about 5% of them are realized, they are a way of the members of the Riksdag to work for
for interests of their voters (Bäck et al., 2015).
Once a proposal has been handed in, the Chamber is informed and the proposal is sent to an appropriate
committee for consideration.
Other committees may hand in their opinions on the proposal to the main
committee, called
yttranden
.
The committee then returns a proposal for a decision to the parliament, a
betänkande
.
This proposal is then up for debate in the chamber, and the parliament votes for a decision.
The proposals may also be debated during other stages in the process.
All the proceedings in the Chamber are recorded and stored in
protocols
. As part of the work of controlling
the government,
the members of the parliament may also debate the Government’s performance of its
official duties. This is done by either writing a question, a
skriftlig fråga
, or an
interpellation
to a member
of the Government.
The former is answered in text, and not debated in the Chamber.
They are intended
to influence a decision or gather information.
An
interpellation
is answered orally, and it’s purpose is
to bring up matters for debate and are not followed by a decision.
After an
interpellation
is answered, a
debate may follow where other members of the parliament may join. Around 400-500
interpellations
are
handed in each year and around 700-1000
skriftliga frågor
(Riksdagen, 2017a) (Bäck et al., 2015).
3.1.2
Selected documents
The purpose of using the Riksdag’s data is to see how the subject of housing policies has varied, and how
this subject has been talked about.
On this basis, the documents deemed to cover debates, discussions
and proposals are chosen.
The scope is Swedish housing policies, therefore all documents related to EU
matters are disregarded.
An overview of the selected documents can be seen in table 4.
As can be seen in the table, the categories
interpellationer
and
skriftliga frågor
don’t cover the full time span.
These files are broken on the parlia-
ment webpage, they are present but empty. Therefore they are not available in Korp either. The timespan
ends in February, 2016.
This is the timespan available from Korp.
Unfortunately there was no time to
include data from more recent times. The
proposition
documents from 2006-2009 are corrupted, this also
from the Korp data.
The documents were split up according to parliamentary periods.
This is to able to
compare the terms, but also to avoid doing topic modeling over a too big span of time.
Topics will have
varied over time and this might confuse the topic modeling.
The
protocols
are chosen because they contain all the debates and proceedings in the Chamber.
The
motions
are chosen because they reflect the opinions and proposals of the members of the Riksdag.
For
14
the same reason the
propositions
are chosen.
Skriftliga frågor
and
interpellationer
are chosen because
they are the questions and inquires of the Riksdag regarding the Government’s work.
Answers to these
questions are also included in this.
The categories
betänkande
and
statens offentliga utredningar(SOU)
are relevant,
but these documents
are very long and contain thorough investigations. The proposals are also very long. Because of this, and
because a single document of these categories can be assumed to only cover one subject, only the first
part of these documents is used.
This is done by extracting the first 3000 words for the
betänkande
and
the first 5000 words for the
propositions
and
SOU
, ignoring the first 500 because they usually contain
a list of contents for the
propositions
and
SOU
, with the hope that this part covers the documents topics
well enough.
Some of the longer documents do contain summaries, but unfortunately there was no time to solve how to
extract only these, since there is no marking in the text indicating where the boundaries of the summaries
are.
Because not all of the documents contain a summary, the method above was preferred.
Out of the documents that were left out 4 categories are strictly administrative, such as speakerlists.
The
others are EU-related, long investigations or reports, or committee documents. The committee documents
were left out because they concern the work of the committees.
The result of this work is a
betänkande
,
and the start is a proposal (a
motion
or a
proposition
), so the subjects of the committees are already in the
selected categories.
There is of course lots information to gather among the rejected documents, but this
is unfortunately beyond the limitations of this work.
Downloading the chosen categories from Korp and extracting the files took about 2 hours per document
category.
All the documents from one category are stored in a single XML-file.
Splitting this file into
separate documents and then sort them took about 7 hours per document category.
In the cases where
only the first 3000 or 5000 words are used, this took an additional 2 hours.

The time marking of the documents vary.
Most of them are marked with date, and in the relevant cases
which political party is behind it.
But some of them are only marked with year or working year of the
Riksdag.
Especially the older documents often lack proper date marking.
To the extent that it has been
possible,
the data has been sorted after date and year.
For the topic modeling,
the data is split up in
parliamentary periods.
The periods and number of documents can be seen in table 5.
This is because this
is a natural split in the data and it is interesting to see if the data differs between these peroids.
For the
topic modeling it is also good to have data that doesn’t span over too long time, because the language and
topics might differ over time, and thus affect the modeling.
All the documents are also not available for
the whole timespan.

Table 5: Periods for the topic modeling.
It is important to note that the language and structure of the different categories vary.
In some of the
shorter documents and in the debates, the language is closer to spoken language, and some of the
protocols
are pure transcriptions from debates.
However, even these debates are in a more formal style than you
would expect from everyday speech, due to the nature of political debates.
They are also edited during
the transcription in order to standardize syntax and morphology (Dahllöf, 2012).The domain itself also
affects the language in all the documents, resulting in lots of domain specific words.
The effect this has
on the topic modeling will be shown in later sections.
3.2
Newstext
To further analyze the public discourse, another domain of the discourse is chosen. To analyze the media,
newspaper and magazine articles have been downloaded from the Media Archive provided by Retriever.
4
The access was provided by Hyresgästföreningen.
The Media Archive is the largest archive of daily
press in the Nordic countries.
Ideally one would use all the published newstexts available, but this was
not possible due to limits in data storage and time.
In order to find all the newstexts concerning housing policies a search term list was made together with
people from Hyresgästföreningen who are knowledgeable of housing policies.
See Appendix D for the
4
https://www.retriever.se/product/nordens-storsta-mediaarkiv/
16
search terms.
Using the Media Archive’s search tool, all the newstexts containing the Swedish word for
housing,
bostad
, in all its forms, and at least one of the words in the search term list were downloaded.
Using the selected search terms captured both relevant and irrelevant newstexts.
The topic modeling
helps us sort out the relevant ones for further analysis.
All the available newstexts were originally published on the web, no printed media is included.The time
span of these newstexts is 2000–2015.
Before 2000 there are no newstexts available.
For the topic
modeling, the data is split up in two 5-year period and one 6-year period, to be able to compare the years
and avoid a too long time span.
These periods are 2000 to 2004, 2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2015.
In table

Table 6: The different periods for the newstexts data.
In total the newstexts come from 1786 different sources.
Most of these sources only contribute with a
few newstexts, and there are a few dominant sources.
The 100 top most occurring sources can be seen
in Appendix B. The 25 most common can be seen in figure 1.
The number of newstexts are growing
each year, probably because the web has been and is growing as a medium.
In general, the number of
newstexts drop during the summer months, presumably because of summer holidays.
17
Figure 1: The 25 most frequent sources with their frequency over the whole time span.
As with the Riksdag, it is important to note that the language in the newstexts differ from the language
in the Riksdag.
The language in the newstexts is more similar to spoken language, and the vocabulary is
closer to everyday Swedish.
3.3
The corpus infrastructure Korp
To be able to choose and filter the data based on linguistic criteria, linguistic annotations are needed.
For
this the corpus tool Korp is used.
5
Korp is a corpus infrastructure tool developed by Språkbanken (The
Swedish Language Bank).
The aim of Korp was originally to provide a tool for linguistic research, but it
has since then grown and now contains a considerable amount of modern and historical Swedish corpora.
Korp gathers many resources for corpus exploration and statistics, and is continually being updated and
extended (Borin et al., 2012).
Korp consists of three parts.
The Korp backend which has web services for searching and exploring
corpora and the Korp front end with a graphical user interface.
The third component is the Korp pipeline
for the annotation and exporting of corpora, which has grown into an independent tool, now developed
as the Sparv pipeline (Borin et al., 2016).
6
This is the part used here.
5
https://spraakbanken.gu.se/swe/node/1535
6
https://spraakbanken.gu.se/swe/node/19799
18
The pipeline can handle both partly annotated corpora and corpora without annotations.
The input for-
mat is plain XML and the pipeline can tokenize, split sentences and paragraphs of the input data.
The
annotation process provides a number of annotations, among them compound analysis, lemmatization,
part of speech (POS) - taggning, named entity recognition and tagging of dependency relations.
As pre-
viously mentioned, only a subset of these are used, namely the POS tags, the dependency relations and
the lemmatization.
Lemmatization is done based on a morphological lexicon available in the form of
SALDO, a Swedish semantic lexicon and lexical resource (Borin et al., 2013).
This lexicon also pro-
vides word senses and compound analysis.
The POS-tagging is done with a trigram tagger trained on the
SUC 3.0 corpus, HunPos.
The tagging of dependency relations is done with the MaltParser, trained on
Talbanken (Borin et al., 2016).
The data from the Riksdag is already available for download through Korp, and thus has all the annotations
needed.
In order to have the same linguistic annotations for the newstexts Sparv was used.
Sparv is
available through a web interface, but due to the large quantity of data this was not used.
The newstexts
were instead annotated using a downloaded version of the pipeline which took approximately 5 hours per
years worth of publications.

Method
This section describes how the work was carried out.
Different filters based on linguistic information
were designed and applied to a test set of the data,
which resulted in different versions of the test set.
Topic models were trained on each version using the Python library Gensim.
The models were evaluated
using human judgement, two semantic coherence measures and perplexity. By comparing the correlation
between human judgements and the two coherence measures, the automatic methods were evaluated. The
highest rated model by the human evaluators was used to explore the rest of the data.
The parliamentary period 2010–2014 from the Riksdag was chosen as the test set.
The combination of
filters resulting in the highest rated model from this test set was applied to the rest of the periods of the
Riksdag data.
Then, topic models were trained on these periods.
Using the topic models for respective
period, the documents from the same period was classified with topics.
These classifications were then
used for investigation of the data set.
The filters from the five highest rated models from the Riksdag test set was also applied to a test set of
the newstext data.
The test set for the newstexts was the documents from the period 2010–2015.
Models
were then trained on the different versions of the newstexts’ test set and evaluated using human judgement
and the best performing coherence measure from the Riksdag.
As with the Riksdag,
the highest rated
combination of filters for the newstext was applied to the rest of the periods and a model was trained on
respective period.
The models were then used to classify all the documents and the classifications was
used as a basis for investigation of the data set.
As previously stated, the language in the two data sets differ, and this is the reason why the highest rated
combination of filters for the Riksdag data is not used directly on the newstexts.
Instead,
the top five
highest rated combination of filters are tested on the newstexts, with the hope that the positive effects of
these filters are general enough to be useful in this new domain.
Also, after initial inspection, the filters
from the Riksdag that used a stop list was changed to instead use a new frequency filter.
Ideally one
would test and evaluate all the filters that were tested on the Riksdag,
however this was not done due
to time limits.
The same holds for the choice to use the best performing coherence measure from the
Riksdag on the newstexts, ideally both coherence measures would be tested on both sets.
However, here
the hope is also that the performance of the coherence measures generalizes to other domains.
19
The process of deciding filters and combinations of filters, and evaluating them, has been a continuous
back and forth process more than the linear process described here.
Initially, the filters were tried and
the models were manually evaluated, because many of the models were easily dismissed due to apparent
useless topics.
Sometimes the effect of a filter needed to be evaluated before it was tried on a large scale.
This process was repeated until the different filter combinations below were determined. For simplicity’s
sake a description of this process is left out of this work.
The first part of this section describes the different linguistic filters, the second describes the topic mod-
eling and the last is about the evaluation.
4.1
Preprocessing and linguistic filters
Before the topic modeling with Gensim all the documents from the original corpora were processed and
rewritten into new files with filters applied.
There were several filters which were combined in different
ways.
By using Korp-annotated data, the data is already tokenized and with white-space is removed.
The data
is in the form of XML-files where every token is an element with attributes.
The attributes contain all
the linguistic information available for a token, such as lemma, POS or compound analysis.
Three groups of part of speech are tested.
The first contains all parts of speech, as is the norm in topic
modeling.
The second group is nouns, verbs, adjectives and participles, from here on called
POS2
.
The
third, following Martin & Johnson (2015) is only nouns.
See table 7 for an overview.
Initially, proper
nouns were also included.
However, after careful consideration they were removed.
Proper nouns such
as names for countries or cities were very informative when they showed up in the topics, but names for
persons easily took over many topics, making them useless.
Group
Meaning
All POS
all parts of speech
POS2
verbs, nouns, adjectives, participles
NN
only nouns
Table 7: Overview of the POS groups.
A separate filter was created based on dependency relations.
The relations were chosen with the aim to
find the meaningful parts of the sentence. The chosen relations are: Agent, object adverbial, direct object,
predicative attribute, place adverbial, subject predicative complement and other subjects.
When filtering
part of speech and dependency relations, a tag is added to each word with the POS/dependency relation.
This is to avoid ambiguity between words.
Punctuation and numbers are removed from all corpora, and all words are changed to lower-case. Unless
stated otherwise, tokens that occur in 50% or more of the documents are removed.
This frequency filter
is called
filter 1
.
Words that occur in less than 5 documents are also removed.
However, the Riksdag
consists of up to 7 sub-corpora for each of the document types, and some words are very frequent in some
types and rare in others. Because of this, the filter is changed to removing words that occur in 50% of the
documents of each sub-corpus.
Ideally,
a frequency filter would suffice to remove the unnecessary words.
Initially when testing the
filters on the Riksdag data the goal was to avoid the use of a stop list.
The reasons for this are many.
If a
suitable frequency filter is found, this filter can be used or at least used as a starting point, when modeling
the other data sets.
Also, because the Riksdag data set spans over a long period of time a stop list crafted
20
for one period may not be suitable for other periods, or other data sets.
But, initial experimenting with
frequency filters showed there was a need for a specific stop list.
At first, a general stop list for Swedish was used.
However, this did not have the desired effect because
the Riksdag data contains many domain specific words, which flooded the topics and made them useless.
These domain specific words did not add any meaning to the topics.
To try to solve this,
filters with
different numbers of the top n-frequent words removed were tested.
These filters did not succeed in
removing all domain specific words, and therefore these words were instead added to the stop list was
manually.
Since every token in the data also is tagged with its lemma, an extra list of lemmas to be excluded was
created.
By doing so,
the writing of the many forms of a word is avoided.
This list was added to the
stop list.
The lemma list and the stop list can be seen in in Appendix G. The lemma list contains about
150 lemmas and the stop list a little less than 500 words and punctuation marks.
Note that there might
be some overlap between the lists.
Punctuation is also removed in previous steps,
therefore the list of
punctuation marks in the stop list is not exhaustive.
Lemmatization is something that could also have an effect on the topic modeling, and therefore the models
here are trained on lemmatized data.
There are also models trained on data without lemmatization,
so
one can compare the difference.
In table 8 all the filters are shown, sorted by POS-group. In total 18 different combinations of filters were
tested. If nothing else is stated, all filters had the frequency
filter 1
applied. All groups are tested without
frequency filter, with lemmatization, and with lemmatization and stop list.
The all POS and the POS2
groups are also tested with filters based on dependency relations.
The POS2 group has 5 more filters.
The reason for this is that in initial manual inspection by the author it was found that the POS2 group and
the all POS group had similar topics, and the effects of the filters were also found to be simliar.
Because
of this, and the need to limit the scope of this work, only the POS2 group was tested with extra filters.
This is also the reason why the NN group is only tested with three types of filters.
Applying filters to the corpus and rewriting the files took ca 1 hour each time.

Table 8: Filters for the Riksdag corpus
The linguistic filters applied to the newstext data can be seen in table 9.
These filters were chosen based
on the results from the topic modeling of the Riksdag data and manual inspection.
Through the initial
manual inspection using only a frequency filter was found to work better for the newstext data than the
Riksdag.
The stop list for the Riksdag data is very domain specific, so it couldn’t be reused.
Because of
this, instead of making a new stop list, a new frequency filter was made.
The alternative filter, named
21
Filter 2
, removes the 300 most frequent tokens in the data and tokens that occur in 75% of the documents.
Applying a filter and rewriting the newstext corpus took 2 hours each time.

4.2
Topic modeling with Gensim
The topic modeling was implemented using the python library Gensim.
7
Gensim is easy to use and
especially suitable for larger data sets (Rehurek & Sojka,
2010).
Evaluation can be carried out with
methods in the library, such as perplexity and various coherence measures. Except for the common LDA
model there are other topic models available, such as HDP and LSI. These models were initially tried, but
didn’t perform as well as LDA and were disregarded.
In the case of HDP the number of topics returned
were much fewer than could be expected to exist in the corpora, and the topics were also of low quality.
The topics returned from LSI were also of lower quality compared to the topics returned from the LDA
model. The quality of the topics were determined by manual inspection by the author, where a low quality
topic is a topic that is not understandable.
When training an LDA model
in Gensim there are a number of parameters to consider,
as with any
topic modeling.
First and foremost is finding an optimal number of topics.
Guided by previous papers,
experiments were run between 50 - 200 topics.
After manual inspection the topic numbers 50-75-100
were chosen for further testing and then 75 topics where chosen for the filter tests.
Other than this the
default configurations were used.
4.3
Evaluation
Evaluation was carried out in three steps. The following was done on all of the models trained on different
versions of the test set.
First, model perplexity was calculated.
During training, 15% of the documents
were held out and then used for calculating the perplexity.
The 15% were chosen at random from the
corpus.
Using the coherence model available in Gensim, the two coherence measures
cv
and
npmi
were calculated.
cv
took 2-3 hours to calculate on the Riksdag data and
npmi
took 1-2 hours, depending on the filter.
cv
was found to be the best measure by Röder et al.
(2015),
but is contradicted by van der Zwaan et al.
(2016) who finds
npmi
to be the best measure, and therefore these are compared.
As a reference corpus
for the word counts the same corpus as the model is trained on is used.
To assess the performance of the coherence measures,
human judgements were collected.
Before the
human evaluation was carried out, a short manual inspection of the models were done by the author. This
resulted in two models being disregarded due to them containing mostly useless topics. These were from
the All Pos group, one without any filter at all, and one with lemmatized words and a frequency filter.

https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/
22
The rest of the models were kept, in total 16.
These models can be seen in tables in the next section.
Six evaluators each rated 8 models, with three people rating the same 8 and the other three rated 8 other.
In total,
there are human judgements for 16 models.
The evaluators were between the age 20-30,
all
native Swedish speakers and with an education level of undergraduate or above.
There was an equal
gender division.
Following Newman et al. (2010) and Lau et al. (2014),
the evaluators were asked to assess the under-
standability of the top 10 words from each topic. The instructions given for the rating can be seen in table
10.
The instructions are translated from Swedish.
Rating
Instruction
1
I don’t find the words to be belong together, I don’t understand the topic.
2
I find about half of the words to belong together, the topic is semi-understandable.
3
I find the topic to be understandable, there is at most one word which doesn’t belong.
Table 10: Instructions for the human evaluators.
For each topic, the mean of the human ratings were calculated and the correlation between these ratings
and the coherence measures were then calculated using Pearsons r.
This was done for every model.
The
cv
coherence measure was found to have the better correlation with the human judgements,
and was
thus used as an evaluation measure for the newstexts.
As stated in the previous section,
five models
corresponding to the five top rated models in the Riksdag test set was chosen for this.
To compare how well the
cv
corresponds to human judgements for the newstext data, this was also col-
lected for the 5 newstext models.
In this case, three evaluators evaluated all five models.
Two of them
had participated in the previous evaluation, one was new. The new evaluator was also a Swedish speaker
between the age 20-30, with an education level of undergraduate or above.
4.4
Labeling of the topics
As stated above, the chosen models for the newstexts and the Riksdag data was used to classify all the
documents in their respective corpora. These classifications were then inspected and used for the analysis
of the data.
This was mainly done by identifying topics of interest.
Here,
the interest lies in housing
policies, and therefore only topics relating to this area was labeled.
The topics from every parliamentary period was manually inspected by the author and in each period one
topic or more related to housing policies was found.
All of these topics were simply labeled ’housing
policies’. In some periods two topics were found to concern housing policies, these were labeled ’housing
policies 1’ and ’housing policies 2’. There was naturally a difference in words used in the topics between
the periods, but all of them are considered to relate to housing policies.
When manually inspecting the topics from the newstext data, there was a lot more topics found concerning
housing policies.
This makes sense, because the selection was more narrow and based on a list of terms.
In some cases it was difficult to determine if a topic concerned housing policies or not.
For example, a
topic mentioning architects could be about housing policies, but it could also be unrelated.
Because of
this, two topics which were clearly concerning housing policies were selected and explored.
Other than this labeling, topics were only labeled when they were cooccurring with the topics of interest
or when a sample document was classified.
In other cases the topics are instead displayed with their top
ten words, see the Results section.
23
As stated on p.9, the labeling of a topic can be subjective.
Some of the labeled topics used here are also
displayed together with the top words and the reader can determine for themselves if they agree with the
labeling.
To the extent it was possible, the labeling was done with the intent to give the topics as general
labels as possible, without removing the specificity and usefulness of the topics.
Ideally there would be
more than one labeler of the topics, but this was not possible due to time limits and resources.

Results
All the results below are for models with 75 topics.
5.1
The Riksdag's data
Below the results for the models trained on the differently filtered test sets from the Riksdag are presented.
The top five models according to humans ratings can be seen in the first column of table 11.
In the table
the mean human rating can also be seen together with the number of 3’s (from the mean rating) for each
of the topics. The maximum number of 3’s is 75, which would mean all human evaluators gave all topics
a score of 3.
The highest rated model is the one with only nouns, a stop list and the frequency filter,
filter 1
(words
occurring in more than 50% of the documents and words with an occurrence of 5 or less are removed).
The words are also lemmatized.
In second place comes the same model, but without the stop list.
The
rest of the top five models are from the POS2 group, but without lemmatization.
The third highest rated
model is also filtered based on dependency relations, the only one in the top five based on dependency
relations.
In the last column of table 11 the perplexity per word is shown, where a low perplexity is desirable.
The
highest rated model model according to humans would preferably have the lowest perplexity value,
if
perplexity is to be useful for evaluation purposes.
The highest rated model does have a low perplexity,
but not the lowest. Table 12 shows the top five models with the lowest perplexity per word. Interestingly,
two of the models in the top five (in italics) were disregarded before the human evaluation because the
topics were deemed not useful.
This, together with the low overlap with the human ratings disqualifies
the use of perplexity as an evaluation measure here.

In table 13 the human ratings are compared to the best ranked models according to the two coherence
measures,

.
The mean topic coherence is also shown, and for both of the measures a high
coherence is desired. There is some overlap between the lists. The top model according to human ratings
is the second best on the
cv
list.
However, the top model according to
cv
is number five according to the
human ratings.
The top rated model according to humans has fallen yet another place on the
npmi
list,
it is ranked as number three.
The top model according to

The correlation between the coherence measures and the human ratings is shown in table 14. Two models
were disqualified at the first inspection, these are shown in italics. The
cv
measure performs slightly better
in most cases, with a mean correlation of 0.68, compared to the mean of
npmi
which is 0.60. Interestingly,
there is a correlation between the correlations of the two measures.
Both have the highest correlation
for the top ranked model by humans, and both have lower correlation for the models with dependency
relations filters, compared to the other models.

Table 14: Correlation with human judgements for CV and NPMI
Based on the results above, the
cv
measure was chosen as the evaluation measure for the newstexts.
The
model chosen to classify the rest of the Riksdag data is the top rated model by humans.
25
Returning to the human judgements, table 15 shows all the models with their ratings.
The percentage of
the original number of words is also shown.
However,
this number doesn’t seem to have an effect on
the ratings,
rather,
it seems it is more important which words are used.
For the models using all parts
of speech, using a stop list significantly improves the results, as expected.
Applying a frequency filter,
which has a similar effect to that of a stop list, also improves the result.
In fact, in the POS2 group, the
frequency filter has a better effect than the stop list, when used alone.
The filter with the selected dependency relations have different effects.
This can be seen comparing all
parts of speech with and without dependency relations,
where the dependency relations filters have a
lower ranking.
This is also seen in the POS2 group comparing the same groups.
However,
the POS2
model without lemmatization,
stop list and dependency relations has a high score.
The POS2 model
without any filter except the dependency filter also has a high score.
In the POS2 group models using lemmatized words have lower ratings than their respective models with-
out lemmatization, contrary to what one would expect. However, the NN models using lemmatized words
have a higher score than all the POS2 models.

5.1.1
Inspection of topics
The topics presented in this section are shown with their tags, both the ones for part of speech and de-
pendency relation.
For the full list of tags and their meaning, see appendix E. As mentioned earlier, the
chosen number of topics was 75.
In the initial manual inspection comparing 50, 75 and 100 topics were
found to contain the roughly the same topics.
However, for the larger the number of topics, the topics
were more fine-grained and branched. Similarly, when using 50 topics, the topics were more general and
broad.
More topics also resulted in an increase of useless topics.
Because of this, 75 topics were chosen.
In general, regardless of filter or number of topics, similar topics were found to recur. For example, there
were always topics concerning healthcare or the labor market. This is of course hard to conclude without
manually labeling all the topics.
Two of the models were disregarded in the initial manual inspection.
These were the models using all
parts of speech and no stop list.
One of them had no frequency filter and no lemmatization, and the other
had lemmatized words and a frequency filter.
Most of the topics from these models were full of function
26
words and very frequent words, leading to useless topics.
An example of this is shown in table 16, the
left topic.
This topic is taken from the model with all parts of speech and lemmatization.
As can be
observed, using no stop list and only the frequency filter was not enough to remove these words.
In the
same table, an example of a good topic can be seen.
This topic comes from the chosen model.
All the
words are related to education and can easily be connected.
This topic also had the highest rating from
all evaluators.

Table 16: Examples of a bad and a good topic.
The LDA model returns the topics together with the prominence, or proportion, of them in the corpora.
The topics that made least sense often had a lower prominence in the corpora than the more useful topics.
The topics with the highest prominence usually contained very general and frequent words, but with a
broad underlying concept, such as the labor market or municipalities.
Examples of this is shown in table
17, where the left topic can be interpreted as being about the Riksdags work, and the right one about mu-
nicipalities and finances.
However, the proportion of topics about the same thing but in different models
differ a lot, probably due to the different linguistic filters.
Because of this, when using the proportion of
a topic as a measure, this should be kept in mind.
Here, the information about prominence or proportion
of the topics in the whole corpora is not used.

Table 17: Common topics
Turning to the effects of the different filters, one topic from the three different part of speech groups are
shown in table 18.
These topics are from lemmatized text, a stop list is used and all models had a high
rating.
The topics are deemed to all be about international aid.
As can be expected,
the POS2 group
contains adjectives and nouns.
The all POS topic is similar to the POS2 topic, and also contains mostly
27
nouns adjectives, but also the proper noun UN. In all the groups, nouns is the most frequently occurring
part of speech.
In table 19 more topics from the same models are shown.
These topics are deemed to be
about healthcare and are all very similar, and here all but two words are nouns.
In the All POS the term
National Board of Health and Welfare
could be considered a proper noun, but here it was tagged as noun
and is therefore treated as one. A note about the all POS, in this model proper nouns were more frequent,
and one topic was made up of only of Swedish names.

Table 19: Comparison of the different POS groups.
An example of the effects of lemmatization is shown in table 20.
The topics come from POS2 models
with a stop list, one is with lemmatization (the same model as above) and one is without lemmatization.
The topic is also the same,
it is about health-care.
In the topic without lemmatization there is a lot of
repetition, but this hasn’t affected the rating, both of the topics had the highest ratings.

Table 20: Comparison of topics with lemmatized and non-lemmatized data.
In table 21 two topics based on a model with dependency grammar is shown. The topics are from the third
highest rated model,which is a model with POS2 and stop list, but no lemmatization.
As with previous
topics, the topics without lemmatization has a a lot of repetition, which is increased by the dependency
tags.
For example, in the left topic the word
boende
(housing/living) occurs both as a subject (ss) and
direct object (oo).
This repetition might influence the understandability of a topic.

Table 21: Two topics from dependency parsing based data.
While inspecting these topics it is obvious that the LDA model captures topics based on semantic coher-
ence, as is the purpose of the model.
However, there were a few curious cases of topics.
English words
were always assigned to a topic of their own, as was names for persons.
This raises the question of what
kind of semantic information is captured by the model.
5.1.2
Performance of the selected model
Before moving forward with analysis with the help of the highest
rated model,
the model
with only
lemmatized nouns and a stop list, there is a need to check if it correctly classifies documents.
To do this
fully would require labeled documents and would defeat the purpose of using topic modeling.
But, it is
important to check the classifications of a few documents to have an idea of the reliability of the model’s
classifications. Here, a few of the documents identified as containing the topic labeled ’housing policies’
were inspected. The document classified as having the highest probability of this topic can be seen below.
29
The document is a
motion
, translated from Swedish.
For the original document, see Appendix F. This
is deemed to be an accurate classification of a document containing the ’housing policies’ topic.
A few
other documents were also inspected and deemed to be accurately classified with the ’housing policies’
topic.
Motion to the Riksdag 2010 / 11:C264 The building of cheap tenancies s34010 Proposal for
decision in the Riksdag.
The Riksdag announces to the Government their opinion of what
is presented in the motion about stimulus for the production of tenancies.
Motivation.
The
Reinfeldt government have removed the housing policy goals from before. This was done at
the same time as when they removed the support for interest and investment in relation to the
construction of new tenancies.
The result has been disastrous consequences for the building
of tenancies. The pursued politics have failed. What is needed now is politics which defends
the tenancy and stimulates the building of tenancies for a reasonable cost.
Such politics
consists of introducing an investment support for tenancies and a review of the neutrality at
the housing market.
Stockholm the 26th of October 2010 Ann-Christin Ahlberg (S) Hans
Olsson (S) Phia Andersson (S)
A few random documents from each document type were also classified and inspected.
For the shorter
document types,
interpellations
,
motions
and
skriftliga frågor
,
most topics were deemed suitable.
An
example of this is seen below.
The document is of the type
skriftliga frågor
, and the top four topics for
this document are labeled ’Fishing & Culture, ’Environment & Water’, ’Food’ and ’Pollution’.
All of
these topics are deemed to fit the document.
The original document in Swedish can be read in Appendix
F.
The 7th of September / Answer to question / 2009/10:99 The Swedish fermented herring.
/
Agriculture minister Eskil Erlandsson / Peter Hultqvist have asked me what measures I plan
to take by reason of the worry for the future of the fermented herring.
The question has its
origins in the temporary exception Sweden has from the EU’s regulations regarding limits of
some toxins in certain fish from the Baltic Sea area, which ends the 31th of Decemeber 2011
/ Sweden has together with Finland a time limited exception from the regulation in the EU
for highest allowed amount of dioxin and PCB in fish, the exception holds for among others
herring from the Baltic Sea. The exception is to a largely based on the fact that Sweden has a
well-functioning system for protection of the public health, through information directed to
the consumers about the consumption of certain fish species from the Baltic Sea area might
need to be limited.
/ The fermented herring is a part of our food heritage and an important
tradition in large parts of Sweden,
and I want to protect that.
I have therefore personally
been in touch with the commission for health and consumer issues, John Dalli, and told him
how important the Swedish tradition surrounding fermented herring is.
The consumption is
also usually very limited in both geographic region and time.
/ Would the exception end and
one does not find another solution it would with all probability mean that all the small-scale
fishing at the Baltic Sea coast would cease to exist. I don’t want to participate in that. Instead
I want to protect the herring,
and if our experts at the agencies makes the assessment that
through the present dietary recommendations and other measures one can ensure the public
health I will act to find a solution that enables further fishing. / Before the coming negotiation
about a continuing exception the government has delegated the National food agency and the
National board of fisheries,
after consulting with the Environmental protection agency,
to
investigate what options there is and what the consequences of thes will have.
The agencies
will leave their final report the 1st of March 2011.
/ Last but not least I want to emphasize
that to solve the problem with pollution in fish from the Baltic Sea the supply of the toxins to
30
the Baltic Sea must be limited.
Sweden actively works with this nationally as well as within
the EU and globally.
/
When inspecting the classifications of the document it was found that topics which had a high probability
were often correct.
But topics with a low probability were often not correct.
(These topics were still
classified as being in the document,
just
not
with a high probability.)
The
protocols
were classified
with lots of topics, which is natural because they are from debates and proceedings which contain many
different subjects.
These topics were often of a more general type, for example about employment and
finances.
This is similar to the results for the
betänkande
,
SOU
and
propositions
.
These document types
were summarized.
Despite this, the retrieved topics for these documents were deemed suitable but quite
broad, usually concerning finances and organizations. However, this might be more due to the specificity
of the topics and the nature of the documents than bad classification.
The chosen topic model doesn’t
have a topic for the finances of the Royal household,
for example,
which is a very specific topic and
therefore a topic concerning finances in general should be good enough.
It is also in the nature of these
documents to contain lots of words related to finances, they are political documents.
5.2
The newstext data
Following the results for the Riksdag,
five filter combinations corresponding to the filters from five
highest rated models for the Riksdag were chosen for the newstext data.
The difference between the
models is that the Riksdag data has a stop list and the newstexts instead use a frequency filter,
called
Filter 2
.
This filter removes the 300 most frequent words, and words that occur in more than 75% of the
documents.
The results from the human judgements can be seen in table 22.
This table corresponds to the top five
models for the Riksdag in table 13, but without the results for the
npmi
measure. The highest rated models
differ from the Riksdag data. Here, the highest rated model is with the POS2 group, frequency filter 2, and
no lemmatization, as opposed to lemmatized nouns with a stop list, which had the highest scores in the
Riksdag. The second place is the same as the Riksdag, but the rest of the models have different rankings.
The frequency filter named
Filter 1
is the previously used filter which removes words occurring in 50%
or more of the documents.
It should be noted that both the mean ratings and number of 3’s are lower overall for the newstext data
than for the Riksdag.
here the maximum number of 3’s is also 75.
The lower ratings might be due to the
replacement of the stop list with a frequency filter, or the nature of the data itself. It could also be that the
results from the Riksdag didn’t generalize well to the newstexts.
Also, since the number of evaluators is
quite small, differences between the evaluators will have a large effect on the ratings.

As with the Riksdag data, the
cv
measure does not correspond to the ratings by humans.
Here, the differ-
ence between the human ratings and the
cv
measure is larger than for the Riksdag data.
The correlation
is also the highest for models with only nouns.

5.2.1
Inspection of topics
The same patterns found in the topics from the Riksdag can be seen in the topics for the newstexts.
Even
in the POS2 topics, nouns occur the most frequent.
When the topics are not lemmatized, there is a lot
of repetition in the most probable words.
Two examples of two top rated topics from the highest rated
model (POS2, note lemmatized,
filter 2
) can be seen in table 23, showing the

Table 23: Top rated topics from the newstext data.
When inspecting the topics,
some major areas or subjects can be found throughout the topics.
One is
the area or topic originally searched for, the housing policies area.
As opposed to the Riksdag, there are
more than one topic related to this.
There are topics related to incidents mentioning housing or living,
for example in reporting of crimes or fires.
There are also topics related to the housing market, where
words describing interiors or renovation are common.
There are also several topics relating to finances,
both private and political. Two examples of topics can be seen in table 24, which comes from the highest
rated model model.
The left topic concerns housing policies and finances, while the right is about crime.

Interestingly, there are also a few topics containing words related to time, including months and weekdays.
In table 25 examples of this is shown. The examples are taken from the top two models, but similar topics
were found in all the models, except for the ones with dependency relations filter.
This is similar to the

5.2.2
Performance of the selected model
In the newstext data, there were more topics found concerning housing policies than in the Riksdag. This
is further discussed in section 5.3.2.
As with the Riksdag data, a few of the documents/newstexts which
had the highest probability of one of the topics labeled ’housing policies’ were inspected.
The model
were found to identify documents good.
An example can be seen below.
This newstext was classified
with the ’lack of housing’ topic.
This is also what this newstext is about.
The Swedish original can be
found in Appendix F.
Dangerous silence in housing policies.
Signed Karlsson.
In almost half of the country’s 290
municipalities there is a lack of housing.
This is showed in a report made by LO. The lack
of housing is the largest in and around the country’s largest cities.
The lack of housing in
Sweden is not news.
But the opinions differ when it comes to what should be done to re-
solve the low building rate.
LO advocates for, unsurprisingly, stimulus from the state.With
15 millions in direct support to new tenancies, LO wants to solve the housing crisis where
the needs are the highest.
The building of housing should not be fueled with state funding.
Instead, to accelerate the building has to be more profitable, partly through simplification and
standardization of building regulations, partly through the removal of the regulation of rents.
Stefan Attefall (KD) has during his time as housing minister started a number of investiga-
tions.
These have resulted in concrete proposals, especially in relation to simplification of
the building process and to create standardized building regulations. It is plausible that a new
legislation will be here soon.
On the other hand, there is no solution to the possibly biggest
problem, the lack of tenancies.
The regulation of the rents of today is counterproductive to
its purpose to break the segregation of housing, as it instead creates another division in the
population, between the ones who have a housing of their own, and the ones who doesn’t.
This especially has an effect on young people, who are about to enter the housing market. To
reduce the large alienation in the Swedish housing market the thresholds need to be lowered.
This is done most easily with simpler and cheaper tenancies and student housings and with
the phasing out of the regulation of rents. Unfortunately, it is all too quiet within the political
arena,
housing issues are not hot topics.
But if there is no acceleration of the building of
houses the risks for the future are a much more dysfunctional work market and a suppressed
growth.
Mattias Karlsson, Kristianstadsbladet, 20131005
A few random newstexts were also chosen and classified by the model, below is one of them.
The top
four topics for this newstext are labeled ’Common verbs’, ’Fire & Emergency’, ’Family’ and ’Building
33
plans’. The first topic is very general, and should maybe have been removed. However, this and the other
three topics do occur in the newstext.
“Their home was eaten by the big fire”.
Göteborg.
Renovation of the whole house at De-
cembergatan 35-53 is ongoing.
Move in is planned to October 2016 for the first, and the last
is planned for January 2017.
The ones who move back arrives to a fully renovated house
with everything new.
Windows, kitchen, bathroom, everything.
Many faults are the reason
for the fire, but not everyone who were evacuated wants to return.
It took a couple of phone
calls before we reached someone was sure of what she wanted. – I want to return for the sake
of my child. He just started school, says Malin Forsell. Her son Liam has been able to stay in
his school because they weren’t moved very far.
The housing company Poseidon says that
care has been taken to current placements at kindergartens and schools when replacement
apartments were distributed.
Families have in general been able to stay in Kortedala, most
of the other ended up in Biskopsgården.
Second hand housing in other parts of the city also
occur.
– I can certainly understand the ones who doesn’t want to return, says Malin Forsell.
The fire has left more or less deep wounds at all the tenants who were evacuated from their
apartments the night between the 10 and 11 th of August.
Malin had to wait about a week
before she was allowed to return to her apartment. – It was a chock, Our bedroom was gone.
All that was left was bars.
A couple of months later she was offered a second chance to see
the apartment. – Everything was still there. I was there to look after some old things, not the
least some pictures.
They had made it, but they smelled of smoke.
They still smell, Malin
says.
Malins apartment on Decembergatan 51 didn’t burn and she has had some help from
Poseidon and her insurance company.
– But you don’t get a compensation for everything.
Our whole life just went up in flames, says Malin who later now have started to miss things
that can’t be replaced. A bit worse is it for her friend Linn Olin who lived at Decembergatan
35.
There was never a fire there.
But the apartment was damaged by water from the ex-
tinguishing.
– We could rescue some of the furniture, but I had had big problems with the
insurance company, who among other things questions that I had so much food in my fridge
and they don’t answer and are hard to get in touch with,
says Linn.
Both Malin and Linn
also thinks that it’s hard to get in touch with someone at Poseidon who can answer questions.
– Everyone refers to someone else.
Why isn’t there someone designated who we can turn
to with everything related to this, says the both of them.” Bertil Guslén, Göteborgs-Posten,

Analysis of the corpora with the help of the models
5.3.1
Riksdagen
After selecting the highest rated model for the Riksdag, this model was trained on all the parliamentary
periods, respectively.
The model for each period was then used to classify all the documents in the same
period.
The topics for each period was manually inspected, and in every period a topic corresponding to
housing policies was found.
In some of the periods, two topics were found.
Examples of topics labeled
’housing policies’ can be seen in table 26.
In all the periods the topic or topics labeled ’housing policies’
were fairly similar.

Table 26:
Example of
topics labeled ’housing policies’
from the period 1979–82 and the period
2006–2010
With the help of the chosen model classification, there is now a classification for each document.
This is
a list of topics the models finds in the document and the proportion of the topics.
With this, and a topic
labeled ’housing policies’, the data can be inspected in different ways.
Here follows a few suggestions
and examples.
First, using the classifications one can see how many documents contain the ’housing policies’ topic.
To
filter out the document with a low proportion of the ’housing policies’ topics, documents with less than
35% of the topic was removed.
Figure 2 shows the proportion of documents which contains over 0.35
of this topic in all the
motions
.
Figure 3 shows the proportion of ’housing policies’ in all the shorter
documents.
The time span is from 1998, because
interpellationer
and
skriftliga frågor
aren’t available
before.
Figure 4 shows the same, but for the longer document.
Note that the
SOU
aren’t available until
1994.
Inspecting the figures on can see a peak for almost all of the documents in the period 1998 to 2002. There
are also individual peaks for the different document types.

the short documents.
Figure 4: Proportion of documents with a proportion over 0.35 of the topics labeled ’housing policies’ in
the long documents.
37
To examine what
has been talked about
together with the ’housing policies’ topics one can compare
what other topics are found together with this topic.
In figure 5 all the
motions
from 1974 containing
the ’housing policies’ topics are shown.
They are shown together with the most frequently cooccurring
topics with the ’housing policies’ topic.
Each column represents a document,
with the date they were
handed in.
The y-axis is in chronological order.
The proportion of each topic in respective document is
shown in the intersection between the rows and the columns.
The most frequently cooccurring topic is
about the municipalities and taxes.
The cooccurrence is calculated from the whole period 1973 to 1976, the topics shown are the most fre-
quently cooccurring topics with the ’housing policies’ topic from that period.
Ideally, the motions from
the whole period would be shown, but the figure would be too condensed and hard to interpret if all
mo-
tions
were shown.
Note that the cooccurring topics are also calculated from all the document types, not
only the
motions
.
The most frequently cooccurring topics for the ’housing policies’ topics from the period 1991 to 1994
are shown in figure 6, together with the
motions
from 1992 and their proportion of these topics.
Only the
motions
from January for that year are shown, because as with the previous figure this figure would also
be to condensed to interpret if more document were added.
Here there is a small shift in topics, although
most of them are still concerning economy in different ways, and municipalities.
In figure 7 the most frequently cooccurring topics for the ’housing policies’ topics is again shown, but
for the period 2010 to 2014.
The
motions
are also shown here, but only for the month September.
This is
for the same reason as the previous figures. There were no
motions
from January containing the ’housing
policies’ topic,
otherwise these would have been shown for comparison.
Here ’Healthcare’ has come
up as the most frequently cooccurring topic.
In 2012 the ’housing policies’ topics were found in 228
motions
, but only in 4 of the
propositions
.
It was also only found in 22 of the
interpellations
, these can
be seen in figure 8.
The number of documents in the following figures is different, and this results to slight differences in size
of the figures.
For readability reasons these differences are kept.

To explore the results and the topic model more thoroughly, an interactive plot was made with the help
of the Python library Bokeh.
8
A screenshot of this plot is seen in figure 9.
The static plot is seen in
figure 10.
The static figure is similar to the previous figure,
but includes all topics.
It also shows all
documents, not just the ones containing the ’housing policies’ topics.
The documents on the y-axis are
in chronological order.
As can be seen in the screenshot, when hovering the mouse over a square, the
name of the document it represents is shown, in this case
Livet efter skyddat boende
(Life after protected
housing).
The topic is unnamed,
but the top ten words of the topic are displayed.
They include
våld
,
(violence),
kvinna
(woman), and
barn
(children).
The proportion of the topic is also shown.
Together
with the title, one can assume that the document is classified in a correct way.
This interactive plot or visualization is thus both a way to explore the data, but also a way to examine
how the model classifies documents.

5.3.2
The newstext data
As previously stated, there were more topics concerning ’housing policies’ in the newstext data then in
the Riksdag data.
Two topics were thus chosen for further investigation.
The first topic chosen was a
topic concerning rents.
See table 27 for an example of this topic.
We can see how the cooccurring topics
for the ’rents’ topic has varied in this span in the figures 11 , 12 and 13.
The second topic is
bostadsbrist
.
The topic can also be seen in table 27.
It was only found in the last
period, 2010–2015, something which may say something in itself.
In figure 14 this is seen, together with
the most occurring topics.

As with the Riksdag, an interactive plot was made. An example of how this looks is seen in figure 15. The
full plot, but static, is seen in figure 16.
This figure shows the 50 first newstexts in July, 2014.
However,
only newstexts containing the lack of housing topic (25) were selected, and therefore this topic is visible
as a thick line.
Naturally, the proportion of the lack of housing topic varies between newstexts, and this
can be seen in the color nuances in the line.
The most frequently cooccurring topics are seen further
below,
number 66 and 67.
These are about politics and political parties (67) and property owners and
public housing (66). Topic number 33 is also cooccurring for a few newstexts. This topic is about student
housing, and one would assume this topic would be more cooccurring during the months before a new
semester starts.
This can be further investigated if we inspect figure 17.
This figure shows the mean of
each topic for every month during 2014.
As with the earlier figures, only newstexts containing the lack
of housing are used. The lack of housing topic is removed, to be able to see the other topics more clearly.
Figure 18 shows the plot with the lack of housing topic included.
In figure 17, topic nr 33 (student housing) is slightly more cooccurring during July, August and September,
as expected.
This is more visible in this plot, as compared to the plot including the lack of housing topic
(figure 18).
The most frequent topics in figure 16 are frequent over the whole year.
Topic number 67,
which concerns political parties and politics have a strong peak in August.
In September 2014, general
elections were held in Sweden,
and this could explain this peak.
Other frequent topics are number 39
and 57.
39 is about investments and growth, and 57 are a topic of general words such as
said
.
Another
trend more visible in the plot without the lack of housing topic,
is that topic nr 63 is more frequently
cooccurring during the first two months of the year than the other months.
This topic is about legislation
and proposals.

Discussion
This section discusses the results from the previous section.
6.1
Evaluation methods
Evaluating evaluation methods wasn’t one of the original aims for this work, but by using both human
judgement and computational methods this came naturally.
Early in the process the perplexity measure
was found to be not good, and this result replicates previous research (Chang et al., 2009).
However, this
measure is easily accessible in many toolkits, including the one used here.
Possibly this measure could
be used as a first step towards developing a good model.
The results of the two semantic coherence measures follow the results of Röder, the
cv
measure performs
better than the
npmi
.
The correlation values here are not as high as in their work, which reports a mean
of 0.731, as compared to a mean of 0.68. But, this mean is much higher than the results of van der Zwaan
et al. (2016), were
cv
is reported to have a correlation of 0.129.
A difference in correlation should also
be expected,
the topic modeling has been carried out on different data sets,
with different languages,
preprocessing and filters.
The expected effect of language specificity was not present.
For the newstexts,
cv
performed similarly to the Riksdag data. Models with nouns have the highest corre-
lation, however two of the POS2 models have very low correlation.
cv
also ranks the models differently
than the humans.
These similarities between the models could indicate that the measure generalizes well
between the two data sets.
The
cv
measure’s ranking of the models differ from the human ratings, although with a small margin (0.57
vs 0.566) for the Riksdag.
This suggests that while
cv
can be used as a guide for selecting topic models,
one should also use complementary evaluation methods.
It should also be noted that the correlation was
the highest between the human rankings and both measures for models using only nouns.
The human judgement has been used as a gold standard here, but it is important to note that because there
was a low number of evaluators the results are sensitive to small differences in the ratings. This might be
the explanation for the lower results for the newstext data, where a new evaluator was employed.
This
could also be the reason for why the highest reported number of 3’s was 27, when the highest possible
number was 75.
Note that the number of 3’s is from the mean rating for every topic.
6.2
Effects of the linguistic filters and preprocessing
One of the two aims of this work was to examine the effect of different kinds of preprocessing.
The
results have been presented in previous sections, and here it will be discussed.
The highest rated models in the Riksdag data are trained only on nouns.
This result is also partly found
in the top models according to the semantic coherence.
This follows the results of Jockers (2013), who
reports better topics with only nouns,
and the results of Martin & Johnson (2015),
who report higher
coherence for nouns.
Martin & Johnson (2015) also report higher coherence with lemmatized data.
The highest rated model
from the Riksdag does have lemmatized nouns.
However the model with non-lemmatized nouns has no
frequency filter.
This will have had a negative effect on the ratings for that model, and may influence the
comparison between the models.
The highest rated model for the newstexts is also not from lemmatized
data.
53
Looking at the effect of lemmatization overall,
for the all POS group and the NN group,
lemmatized
models have higher ratings and coherence.
In fact, the non-lemmatized all POS model was disregarded
before the evaluation. However, as with the noun model above, this model also lacks frequency filter and
stop list.
This is probably the reason for the low ratings.
Comparing models based on the POS2 group with same filters,
with the exception of lemmatization
and no lemmatization, it can be observed that the later has higher ratings.
This could indicate that non-
lemmatized data is to be preferred, contrary to what was initially assumed here.
This initial expectation
was due to the fact that Swedish has a richer morphology than English and therefore the results was
expected to improve with lemmatization.
However, this effect might not be present.
But, lemmatization can’t be disregarded completely.
By observing the topics from non lemmatized and
lemmatized models,
it was found that models without lemmatization often had repetition of the same
word in the top words.
The evaluators were asked how understandable a topic was, and the same word
but in different forms would presumably be interpreted as understandable.
This might be the reason
why non-lemmatized data is rated higher.
Furthermore, understandable is not the same as informative,
which perhaps the evaluators should have been asked for instead, although this criteria is harder to assess
without knowing the task at hand.
This is also more subjective.
To conclude, the effect of lemmatization
is unclear.
Repeating what is stated above, the highest rated model in the Riksdag is trained on only nouns, despite
that they are lemmatized.
The highest rated model from the newstexts is based on the POS2 group, non
lemmatized, but with the lemmatized nouns as number two.
This indicates that part of speech has more
influence on the ratings of the topics than lemmatization.
In all the inspected topics from all the models,
the most frequent part of speech was nouns, so it is not surprising that models trained on nouns have high
ratings.
The dependency relations filter had a very obvious effect, it worsened both the ratings and the coherence
measures.
This is a bit surprising, because most of the selected words were nouns, which improved the
results for the other models.
The choice of dependency relations could be the cause of this,
or using
dependencies for the selection might not suit the LDA model.
There is also one exception,
the POS2
model with a stop list had improved ratings after the dependency relations filter was added.
In general,
in order to draw more conclusions,
more tests need to be done,
both on other dependency
relations then the ones tested here and on the NN and the All POS group.
Both of these groups needs
to be tested with frequency filters but without lemmatization,
in order to further examine the effect of
lemmatization.
Using a frequency filter and stop list almost always improved the result for both data sets, which is to be
expected.
There are two exceptions, for the newstext data the nouns with a lower frequency filter was
ranked higher than the one with a higher frequency filter.
This could be the frequency filter removing
too many words.
The other example is POS2 with dependency relations, from the Riksdag, which has a
higher result without a frequency list than with it. However, with a stop list and frequency list the models
have the higher rankings.
This could also be due to the frequency list removing important word,
but
leaving words the stop list would then remove.
The stop list for the Riksdag data was based on the period 2010–2014, and then used for all the periods.
This is not ideal, because the time span is quite large and the vocabulary surely will have changed over
time.
However,
the stop list is deemed to generalize ok,
because there were good topics from all of
the periods.
This might be because of the formality of the Riksdags language, possibly the vocabulary
changes slower and is more fixed as compared to other domains due to this.
54
For the newstext data using frequency only was deemed good enough.
The difference in results, and the
difference in the ranking of the models for the two data sets, highlight the need for different preprocessing
for different domains.
The newstext domain presumably has a less formal language, with fewer domain
specific words than the Riksdag and this might be the reason a frequency filter is suitable instead of a
stop list.
That the style of the newstext language is closer to spoken language might also be the reason.
However, when inspecting the topics from the newstext, at least one topic was found containing general
words such as
says
.
There might be a need to use a stop list for this domain too.
As stated above, the order of the top five models differ a lot between the two data sets, and the highest
rated model is different between the data sets.
The newstexts models had lower ratings overall.
This
indicates that the five highest rated combination of filters from the Riksdag data might not generalize
well to the newstexts, however the highest rated model for the newstexts was still found to be useful.
As stated in the background section,
many papers about topic modeling don’t explain or elaborate on
which preprocessing methods have been used.
The aim here has been to systematically explore the
effects of preprocessing,
and this becomes even more important if different domains require different
preprocessing and even different linguistically informed preprocessing, as suggested by the results here.
6.3
The chosen model and topics
The fact that there is a good LDA model for the Riksdag contradicts the results of Hägglöf (2014) who
found LDA not be a suitable model for the same data.
But, one can always discuss how good the chosen
model is.
In the Background section, the robustness of topic models was briefly mentioned.
Here there
has been no thorough investigation of robustness, but through the manual inspection by the author the
same topics were found to recur.
But, this is of course something that needs to be further investigated.
As discussed in the previous section,
the evaluators were asked to rate according to understandability.
But how understandable,
or interpretable,
are the final models? For the Riksdag,
the model with only
nouns were chosen.
Jockers (2013) argues that if one wants to explore sentiment, adjectives should be
included in the analysis.
However, in most of the models here nouns were the dominant part of speech
in the topics,
regardless of which POS filter was used.
For the newstext data a model from the POS2
group was chosen as the best model, but with nouns as the second highest rated model.
This means that
even if one wants to explore sentiment through adjectives, simply including them in the data might not
be enough.
Both of the two issues above could be further investigated, as could the many other parameters involved
in topic modeling.
However one must also focus on the usefulness of the model,
and what is needed
from it. Inspecting the data sets with the help of the models is indeed feasible, as demonstrated in section
5.3.
As mentioned in the evaluation of topic models, Jockers (2013) discusses if one can trust a model
with not only good topics.
He comes to the conclusion that one model cannot capture everything, and
that there is no reason not use it if it describes the topics one needs.
Of course, a good topic model is
preferred over a mediocre one.
In the same spirit, continuing with the lens analogy fromDiMaggio et al.
(2013), here a model is found that can describe what was searched for.
To conclude, the chosen models
here serve their purpose, but there is always room for improvement.
The labeling of the topics was as previously stated done by the author.
To label topics can be subjective,
but in order to interpret the topics this was needed.
However, in the interactive plots the topics are also
presented with the words from the topics instead of labels.
This gives the reader the opportunity to by
himself/herself explore the results and topics.
55
6.4
Data analysis
One of the aims of this thesis was to show how one could use language technology for analysis. In section
5.3 this has been exemplified.
There is a lot left to do for a full analysis, and most of the data is ready to
be examined further.
It has been shown that the chosen method, LDA topic modeling, is suitable for identifying and following
trends in the chosen corpora.
This was slightly more successful in the newstext data, possibly because
of the less formal language, although the topics were rated higher in the Riksdag data.
That the trends
were harder to follow in the Riksdag might be because the data wasn’t filtered like the newstexts.
In the
newstext data, a filter had been applied before the preprocessing, for selecting documents, and thus more
relevant document were found.
The topics found in the documents of Riksdag were more diverse than the newstexts.
In all the inspected
documents from the riksdag there seems to be fewer cooccurring topics and this will also have had en
effect on the following of trends.
Although this must be further investigated.
In retrospect, one could have wished for some of the topics could have been more narrow in their scope
for a more precise analysis.
Also,
despite thorough preprocessing,
there were still a few topics full of
general words. There were also some topics about very general subjects. For the Riksdag data, this could
be because the topic modeling was done on all the document types together.
However, the topics serve
their purpose in identifying documents.
The next step in the analysis could be to do topic modeling on
only these, in order to find more nuances in the data.

Conclusions and future work
7.1
Conclusions
The first aim of this work was to exemplify how topic modeling could be used for analysis of public
discourse, by investigating how the topics labeled ’housing policies’ have varied over time and what is
has cooccurred with. In section 5.3 this was shown, and the conclusion is that the topic modeling method
LDA can be used for investigation of public discourse regarding housing policies.
The second aim was to investigate how topic modeling is affected by different preprocessing, based on
linguistic information.
Of the three categories investigated here, part of speech had the largest impact on
the results.
Using nouns improved the topics.
Models based on verb, adjectives, participles and nouns
also improved the topics, however the most frequent part of speech in these models is nouns.
Lemmatization data is not as good as non-lemmatized data,
however without lemmatization the same
words are repeated in the topics.
This might have an effect on the topics usefulness and interpretability
and it is thus unclear if non-lemmatized data is preferred.
Using data selected based on dependency
relations does not result in good topics,
however this might change if one uses different dependency
relations.
The evaluation of the topic models showed that the
cv
measure has a better correlation with human judge-
ments than the
npmi
measure.
Both of the measures has the highest correlation for models using only
nouns.
56
7.2
Future work
There are many directions in which the results of this work could be taken further.
First and foremost, the results of the topic modeling and the classifications need to be further investigated
for a full analysis.
For example, the full time span could be considered and different periods could be
compared against each other.
The results could also be incorporated in some corpus exploration tool
such as Korp.
The interactive visualization could in these cases have a link to the specific documents
for further exploration.
The interactive plot could also be used as a means for evaluation, at least for an
initial manual evaluation.
Regarding evaluation,
the evaluation of the coherence measures could also be further explored.
More
measures need to be compared, as only two such measures were compared here.
The effect of different
reference corpora for the word statistics for the coherence measures is something that needs to be evalu-
ated as well.
Here, the same corpora was used both for topic modeling and for the coherence measures.
The topic modeling in itself could also be further explored.
For example,
the robustness of the model
could be checked by labeling topics and documents.
There is more work to be done when using a stop
list, or trying to avoid using one.
Different number of frequent words could be tested, to find the optimal
number of words to avoid.
There is more linguistic information to use, for example word sense or named entity recognition, which
are both already available through the annotation. Other possible extensions could be to split compounds
into parts, or using bigrams or multiword expressions. The information used here also needs to be further
investigated, especially the effect of both lemmatization and dependency parsing.

Motion till riksdagen2010 / 11:C264av Ann-Christin Ahlberg m.fl.
( S ) Byggandet av bil-
liga hyresrätter s34010 Förslag till riksdagsbeslut Riksdagen tillkännager för regeringen som
sin mening vad som anförs i motionen om stimulanser för produktionen av hyresrätter . Mo-
tivering Regeringen Reinfeldt har slopat de bostadspolitiska målen som tidigare fanns . Detta
gjordes samtidigt som de slopade ränte- och investeringsstöden vid nybyggnation av hyres-
rätter . Resultatet har givit förödande konsekvenser för byggandet av hyresrätter . Den förda
politiken har misslyckats .
Det som nu behövs är en politik som värnar om hyresrätten och
stimulerar byggandet av hyresrätter till en rimlig kostnad . En sådan politik består i att införa
ett investeringsstöd för hyresrätter samt en översyn av neutraliteten på bostadsmarknaden .

Swedish original of the written question used as an example on page 30.
den 7 september / Svar på fråga / 2009 / 10:999 Den svenska surströmmingen / Jord-
bruksminister Eskil Erlandsson / Peter Hultqvist har frågat mig vilka åtgärder jag tänker
vidta med anledning av oron för surströmmingens framtid .
Frågeställningen har sin up-
prinnelse i det tillfälliga undantag Sverige har från EU:s regler om gränsvärden för vissa
miljöföroreningar i
viss fisk från Östersjöområdet
som upphör den 31 december 2011 /
Sverige har tillsammans med Finland ett tidsbegränsat undantag från de regler som gäller
inom EU för tillåtna högsta halter av dioxiner och PCB i fisk , undantaget gäller bland an-
nat strömming från Östersjön .
Undantaget baseras till stor del på att Sverige har ett väl
fungerande system för att skydda folkhälsan , genom information riktad till konsumenterna
om att
konsumtionen av vissa fiskarter från Östersjöområdet
kan behöva begränsas .
/
Surströmmingen är en del av vårt matarv och en viktig tradition i stora delar av Sverige
, och det vill jag värna .
Därför har jag personligen haft kontakt med kommissionären för
hälso- och konsumentfrågor John Dalli och berättat om hur viktig den svenska traditionen
kring surströmming är .
Konsumtionen är dessutom vanligtvis begränsad såväl geografiskt
som tidsmässigt / Skulle undantaget upphöra och man inte finner någon annan lösning så in-
nebär det också med all sannolikhet att den övervägande delen av det småskaliga fisket längs
ostkusten skulle slås ut .
Det vill jag inte medverka till .
I stället vill jag värna surströmmin-
gen , och om våra experter på myndigheterna gör bedömningen att man genom nuvarande
kostråd och andra åtgärder säkerställer folkhälsan kommer jag att verka för en lösning som
möjliggör fortsatt fiske .
/ Inför den kommande förhandlingen om ett fortsatt undantag
har regeringen givit Livsmedelsverket och Fiskeriverket i uppdrag att ,
efter samråd med
Naturvårdsverket , utreda vilka handlingsalternativ som finns och vilka konsekvenserna blir
av de olika handlingsalternativen .
Myndigheterna ska lämna sin slutrapport senast den 1
mars 2011 .
/ Sist men inte minst vill jag betona att för att få bukt med problemet med
miljöföroreningar i fisk från Östersjön måste tillförseln av dessa föroreningar till Östersjön
begränsas .
Sverige arbetar aktivt med detta såväl nationellt som inom EU och globalt .

Farlig tystnad inom bostadspolitiken Signerat Karlsson .
I nästan av hälften av landets 290
kommuner råder det bostadsbrist .
Det visar en rapport som LO tagit fram .
Störst är bristen
xi
på bostäder i och omkring landets storstäder .
Bostadsbristen i Sverige är ingen nyhet.Men
vad som ska göras för att råda bot på det låga byggandet råder det delade meningar om .
LO
förespråkar föga överraskande statliga stimulanser .
Med 15 miljarder kronor i direkt stöd
till nya hyresrätter och studentboende vill LO lösa bostadskrisen där behoven är som störst
.
Bostadsbyggande ska inte dopas med statliga medel .
För att sätta fart på byggandet måste
det istället bli mer lönsamt , dels genom att byggkraven förenklas och standardiseras , dels
genom att hyresregleringen tas bort .
Stefan Attefall ( KD ) har under sin tid som ansvarig
bostadsminister dragit igång en rad utredningar . Dessa har landat i konkreta förslag , framför
allt vad gäller förenklingar av byggprocessen och att skapa enhetliga byggkrav . Det är troligt
att en ny lagstiftning är på plats inom kort .
Däremot finns det i dag ingen lösning på det
kanske största problemet , bristen på hyreslägenheter . Dagens hyresreglering motarbetar sitt
syfte att bryta bostadssegregering då den istället skapar en annan uppdelning av befolkningen
, de som har en egen bostad och de som inte har .
Framför allt drabbar detta unga människor
som ska ta de första kliven in på bostadsmarknaden . För att minska det stora utanförskapet på
den svenska bostadsmarknaden måste trösklarna sänkas . Det görs med enklare och billigare
hyreslägenheter och studentboenden och genom att hyresregleringen fasas ut .
Tyvärr är
det allt för tyst inom politikens område , bostadsfrågor är inte hett .
Men får man inte fart
på det svenska bostadsbyggandet är riskerna för framtiden betydande med en dysfunktionell
arbetsmarknad och en tillväxt som hämmas . Mattias Karlsson,Kristianstadsbladet,20131005

Deras hem slukades av storbranden - Göteborg Renovering av hela huset Decembergatan
35-53 pågår . Inflyttning är planerad till oktober 2016 för de första , januari 2017 för de sista
.
De som flyttar tillbaka kommer till ett totalrenoverat hus med nytt allt .
Fönster ,
kök ,
badrum , allt.Flera brister orsak till branden Men alla som evakuerades efter branden är inte
säkra på att de vill återvända . Det tog ett antal telefonsamtal innan vi stötte på en som var helt
säker på vad hon vill .
- Jag vill återvända för mitt barns skull .
Han har just börjat skolan
,
säger Malin Forsell .
Sonen Liam har kunnat gå kvar i sin skola då de inte måste flytta
särskilt långt bort .
Bostadsbolaget Poseidon säger att hänsyn tagits till befintliga platser på
dagis och i skola när ersättningslägenheter fördelats .
Barnfamiljer har i allmänhet fått vara
kvar i Kortedala , merparten av övriga har hamnat i Biskopsgården .
Bostäder i andra delar
av stan förekommer också .
- Jag kan mycket väl förstå de som inte vill återvända , säger
Malin Forsell . Branden har lämnat mer eller mindre djupa sår hos alla hyresgäster som blev
evakuerade ur sina lägenheter natten mellan den 10 och 11 augusti .
Malin fick vänta en
dryg vecka innan hon tilläts återvända till sin lägenhet . - Det var en chock . Vårt sovrum var
borta .
Allt som återstod var ett galler , säger hon .
Ett par månader senare erbjöds en andra
chans att återse bostaden .
- Allt stod kvar .
Jag var där för att se efter en del gamla saker ,
inte minst bilder .
De hade klarat sig , men luktade ju rök .
De luktar än , berättar Malin .
Malins lägenhet på Decembergatan 51 brann och hon har fått en del hjälp från Poseidon och
sitt försäkringsbolag .
- Men inte ersättning för allt . Hela vårt liv brann ju upp , säger Malin
som på senare tid börjat sakna en del saker som aldrig kan ersättas .
Lite värre är det för
kompisen Linn Olin som bodde på Decembergatan 35 .
Där brann det aldrig .
Lägenheten
blev dock allvarligt vattenskadad av släckningen .
- Vi kunde bärga en del möbler , men jag
har haft stora problem med försäkringsbolaget , som till exempel ifrågasätter att jag hade så
mycket mat i min kyl och som inte svarar eller är svåra att få tag i , säger Linn .
Både Malin
och Linn tycker också att det är svårt att få tag i någon på Poseidon som kan svara på frågor
.
- Alla hänvisar till någon annan .
Varför finns det inte någon utsedd vi kan vända oss till
med allt i just denna saken , säger båda .

Mycket försvann för Malin Forsell och sonen Liam i branden på Decembergatan . För Malin
Forsell och sonen Liam försvann allt i branden på Decembergatan i augusti .
Därefter bodde
xii
de på hotell innan de fick en ersättningslägenhet på Julaftonsgatan .
- Vi ska flytta tillbaka ,
säger Malin .
