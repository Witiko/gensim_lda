ABSTRACT 
Information Retrieval 
Literature Exploration 
Latent Semantic Analysis 
The fast increasing amount of articles published in the biomedical field is 
creating difficulties in the way this wealth of information can be efficiently 
exploited 
by 
researchers. 
As 
a 
way 
of 
overcoming 
these 
limitations 
and 
potentiating a more efficient use of the literature, we propose an approach for 
structuring the results of a literature search based on the latent semantic 
information extracted from a corpus. Moreover, we show how the results of the 
Latent Semantic Analysis method can be adapted so as to evidence differences 
between results of different searches. We also propose different visualization 
techniques that can be applied to explore these results. Used in combination, 
these 
techniques 
could 
empower 
users 
with 
tools 
for 
literature 
guided 
knowledge exploration and discovery.

Introduction 
In a thriving and evolving research area such as 
biomedicine, where the scientific literature is 
the main source of information, containing the 
outcomes of the most recent studies, being able 
to efficiently explore the literature or conduct a 
systematic 
literature 
search 
is 
fundamental. 
However, the fast increasing amount of articles 
published in this field creates difficulties in the 
way information can be searched and used by 
researchers 
[Shatkay, 
2005; 
Lu, 
2011]. 
Moreover, the inherent interrelations between 
concepts 
and 
the 
different 
perspectives, 
or 
themes, under which a given idea or concept 
may be studied are also important and introduce 
another level of complexity in exploring the 
literature associated with this specific domain. 
Given a disease, for example, researchers may 
be 
interested 
on 
different 
aspects, 
from 
the 
underlying genetics, to previous studies using a 
particular laboratory technique or experiment, to 
more clinically oriented information. 
Biomedical researchers may use services such 
as PubMed, Google Scholar, or one of the many 
available tools specifically aimed at this domain 
[Lu, 2011]. The results of these tools are usually 
presented in the form of a list of documents, 
with 
no 
indication 
of 
how 
they 
are 
related 
between each other or to the search expression. 
Users are familiarized with this type of output, 
but exploring the information contained in the 
documents, and relating pieces of information 
obtained from various documents, is difficult 
and inefficient. Moreover, although it is trivial 
to perform simple literature searches using such 
tools, translating a more complex information 
need 
to 
a 
search 
expression 
that 
returns 
a 
satisfactory (from the user perspective) set of 
results is a much more difficult task. This means 
that, especially when conducting an exploratory 
literature search, researchers often have to sift 
through 
vast 
amounts 
of 
documents. 
In 
that 
process, 
they 
will 
iteratively 
check 
related 
references and reformulate their queries in view 
of the knowledge they gather at each point, 
looking 
for 
more 
specific 
or 
more 
relevant 
information 
[Kim 
and 
Rebholz-Schuhmann, 
2008]. In the past years, different approaches 
have been proposed and evaluated as ways to 
facilitate simple literature searches, exploratory 
analysis 
and/or 
literature-based 
knowledge 
discovery. Some of these works have focused 
on literature-based methods for data analysis, 
generally 
extracting 
from 
the 
literature 
some 
sort of semantic descriptors to help compare or 
associate 
experimental 
data, 
such 
as 
sets

genes [Homayouni et al., 2005; Chagoyen et al., 
2006; Done et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011]. In this 
work, we focus on facilitating literature searches 
and exploratory literature analysis. Our aim is to 
explore ways to overcome the limitations of 
current 
literature 
retrieval 
tools, 
helping 
researchers 
in 
searching 
and 
exploring 
the 
wealth of information enclosed in the scientific 
biomedical literature, by structuring the search 
results according to their latent semantics. In 
this 
work, 
we 
evaluate 
the 
use 
of 
Latent 
Semantic 
Analysis 
(LSA) 
for 
structuring 
the 
results 
of 
literature 
searches 
into 
high-level 
semantic divisions, or themes. LSA is a natural 
language 
processing 
technique 
that 
allows 
analysing 
the 
relations 
between 
a 
set 
of 
documents and the terms that belong to those 
documents, by representing them in a multi-
dimensional semantic space [Landauer et al., 
1998]. LSA is obtained by applying a Singular 
Value 
Decomposition 
(SVD) 
to 
the 
term-
document matrix representation of a corpus, and 
then selecting the most important dimensions 
from this decomposition. Each dimension in this 
semantic space is then represented as a linear 
combination of words from a fixed vocabulary 
(the words that compose the documents in the 
collection), and is usually represented by the list 
of 
words 
with 
highest 
coefficient 
for 
that 
dimension. 
Since 
each 
dimension 
can 
be 
regarded as a different view of the results, we 
argue 
that 
looking 
at 
a 
given 
dimension 
corresponds to exploring the documents from a 
different 
perspective. 
This 
analysis 
allows 
organizing 
the 
documents 
according 
to 
the 
themes they include, providing an intuitive way 
for exploring the document collection. The next 
sections are organized as follows: related works 
are presented in Section 2, Section 3 describes 
the proposed methodology, Section 4 presents 
and 
discusses 
the 
results 
obtained. 
Final 
conclusions are made in Section 5.

Related work 
PubMed is the most popular and widely used 
biomedical 
literature 
retrieval 
system. 
It 
combines boolean and vector space models for 
document 
retrieval 
with 
expert 
assigned 
indexing 
terms 
from 
the 
Medical 
Subject 
Headings (MeSH) controlled vocabulary, and 
provides access to over 20 million citations [Lu, 
2011]. However, as most information retrieval 
(IR) 
systems, 
PubMed 
uses 
query 
proximity 
models to search documents matching a user's 
query terms, returning results in the form of a 
list. Similarly, several other IR tools have been 
developed based on the MEDLINE literature 
database, 
including 
GoPubMed 
[Doms 
and 
Schroeder, 2005], XplorMed [Perez-Iratxeta et 
al., 2003], Chilibot [Chen and Sharp, 2004], 
FACTA 
[Tsuruoka 
et 
al., 
2008], 
EBIMed 
[Rebholz-Schuhmann 
et 
al., 
2007] 
and 
PolySearch [Cheng et al., 2008]. All of these 
tools 
allow 
for 
some 
form 
of 
literature 
exploration. GoPubMed categorizes the results 
according to Gene Ontology (GO) and MeSH 
terms mentioned in the documents. Users can 
select terms in the ontology tree to interactively 
refine the query and filter the results. XplorMed 
extracts the words most strongly associated with 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
abstracts, 
and 
associations 
between 
these 
words. 
Based 
on 
these 
word 
associations 
it 
is 
then 
possible 
to 
iteratively 
extend and refine the set of abstracts. Chilibot 
accepts two or more search terms and processes 
the results using linguistic analysis to identify 
sentences 
describing 
relations 
between 
the 
search terms, displaying the results as a list of 
sentences 
or 
as 
a 
graph, 
from 
which 
inter-
concept relations can be inferred. FACTA and 
EBIMed show the results of a search as a table 
of the most relevant concepts mentioned in the 
returned documents, as well as the sentences 
where each of those concepts co-occurs with 
other terms. PolySearch also identifies concept 
associations, but the type of concept used as 
start and end points are defined initially, from a 
closed set of options. Although these tools allow 
exploring the results in one way or another, they 
all work at the term or concept level. None of 
these 
tools 
identifies 
higher-level 
semantics 
within 
the 
documents, 
which 
would 
allow 
identifying 
implicit 
relations 
and 
assist 
the 
exploration of the results by the user. More 
recently, the focus has been on the use of Latent 
Semantic 
Analysis 
(LSA) 
[Landauer 
et 
al., 
1998; Deerwester et al., 1990] and probabilistic 
topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
(LDA) [Blei et al., 2003]. These models allow 
identifying 
the 
relevant 
themes 
or 
concepts

associated to a document. Zheng et al. [Zheng et 
al., 2010] and Jahiruddin et al. [Jahiruddin et al., 
2010] 
have 
proposed 
document 
conceptualization 
and 
clustering 
frameworks 
based on LSA and domain ontologies. Zheng et 
al. 
base 
their 
methods 
on 
a 
user-defined 
ontology, matching the terms that compose this 
ontology to phrase chunks extracted from the 
documents in a collection. LSA is then applied 
to the term-document matrix constructed from 
these matches. The authors demonstrated that 
the application of LSA considerably improves 
document 
conceptualization. 
Jahiruddin 
et 
al. 
integrate natural language processing (NLP) and 
semantic analysis to identify key concepts and 
relations between those concepts. Their method 
starts 
by 
selecting 
candidate 
terms 
from 
the 
noun phrases in the document collection. LSA is 
then 
applied 
to 
the 
matrix 
constructed 
from 
these 
terms 
in 
order 
to 
identify 
the 
most 
important 
ones. 
Relation 
extraction 
is 
also 
performed, by identifying relational verbs in the 
vicinity 
of 
biomedical 
entities 
and 
concepts. 
Validated 
concepts 
and 
interactions 
are 
then 
used to construct a semantic network, which can 
be 
used 
to 
navigate 
through 
the 
information 
extracted from the documents. In this work, we 
also use LSA to identify the latent semantics 
within a corpus. We then explore how the LSA 
results can be organized in order to structure the 
results of search queries, highlighting the most 
important topics related to each different query. 
Throughout the paper, we will interchangeably 
use the terms ‘topic’ and ‘theme’ to refer to the 
underlying theme(s) corresponding to a given 
LSA dimension. However, the use of the term 
‘topic’ should not be confused with its meaning 
as used in (probabilistic) topic models.

Methods 
As mentioned before, our aim is to structure the 
results 
of 
a 
literature 
search 
into 
high-level 
themes, or topics, in order to help researchers 
search and explore the information enclosed in 
the scientific biomedical literature. Following 
our 
rationale, 
this 
process 
should 
be 
user-
centred and user-driven and should consider two 
interlinked 
factors: 
query 
reformulation 
and 
exploration 
of 
results. 
Therefore, 
instead 
of 
focusing on automatic knowledge discovery, we 
propose to give users the tools to search and 
explore 
the 
literature 
in 
an 
iterative 
and 
systematic manner, guided by their knowledge 
of the domain and supported by graphical and 
intuitive 
representations 
of 
the 
relations 
identified between the resulting documents and 
between concepts mentioned in those results. In 
order 
to 
test 
and 
validate 
our 
proposal, 
we 
applied 
our 
methods 
to 
a 
corpus 
related 
to 
neurodegenerative disorders, containing around 
135 thousand Medline documents composed by 
the title and abstract of the publication. The 
PubMed query used to obtain the documents 
was: 
“Neurodegenerative 
Diseases”[MeSH 
Terms] 
OR 
“Heredodegenerative 
Disorders, 
Nervous 
System”[MeSH 
Terms]. 
Articles 
in 
languages other than English or not containing 
an abstract were discarded. The list of MeSH 
term 
assigned 
to 
each 
document 
was 
also 
obtained. Our approach consists of an offline 
phase 
followed 
by 
two 
online 
steps. 
In 
the 
offline 
phase 
we 
calculate 
the 
LSA 
transformation matrix and transform the corpus 
to the LSA space. This operation is performed 
once 
for 
the 
complete 
corpus, 
and 
the 
transformation matrix is kept for transforming 
the user queries into the semantic space. Given a 
query, 
the 
two 
online 
steps 
consist 
of: 
a) 
identifying the significant topics for that query 
and ranking the most relevant documents within 
each 
topic; 
and, 
b) 
obtaining 
a 
list 
of 
representative 
MeSH 
terms 
for 
each 
topic. 
These steps are described in the next sections. 
3.1 Document representation 
Before applying LSA, the corpus was processed 
in 
order 
to 
identify 
vocabulary 
terms 
representing 
concepts 
from 
the 
biomedical 
domain. The vocabulary was created based on 
the UMLS Metathesaurus [NLM, 2013]. The 
Neji framework
1
was used to pre-process the 
corpus and perform concept recognition. A total 
of around 45 thousand distinct concepts were 
identified 
in 
the 
documents, 
producing 
a 
concept-document 
matrix 
with 
135 
thousand 
lines and 45 thousand columns.

3.2 Latent semantic analysis 
Following 
the 
concept 
recognition 
step, 
the 
documents 
are 
represented 
by 
the 
set 
of 
concepts 
occurring 
in 
them, 
and 
the 
term-
document matrix used for calculating the LSA is 
constructed from this representation instead of 
through the most common token level (bag-of-
words) representation. 
The Gensim framework [Rehurek and Sojka, 
2010] 
was 
used 
for 
calculating 
LSA. 
This 
framework implements an incremental method 
for 
performing 
the 
SVD 
step 
in 
the 
LSA 
calculation, 
making 
it 
more 
efficient 
and 
allowing more documents to be added to the 
LSA space. 
3.3 Ranking relevant documents 
This 
step 
starts 
by 
selecting 
only 
the 
most 
relevant LSA dimensions (topics) for the query, 
given 
the 
query 
representation 
in 
the 
LSA 
space. A threshold is applied to eliminate those 
dimensions to which the query is less related, 
i.e. has a smaller coefficient after transforming 
it to the LSA space. This is an important step 
since the LSA transformation is applied to the 
complete 
corpus 
and 
will 
in 
general 
include 
many dimensions that are not relevant for a 
given query. Next, we proceed to ranking the 
relevant documents within each of the selected 
topics. 
Given the selected dimensions, a first approach 
for finding the most similar documents is simply 
to project the documents and query values in 
each 
dimension 
and 
calculate 
the 
distance 
between them (Fig. 1). This, however, does not 
consider 
the 
relevance 
of 
the 
documents 
for 
each 
topic. 
Inspecting 
Fig. 
1, 
although 
the 
distance between the query Q and document A 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
distance 
between 
Q 
and 
document C for dimension 1, C is much more 
related to this dimension than A and should 
therefore have a higher score. To account for 
this, we calculate a score for each document in 
each dimension, given by the product of the 
document’s LSA coefficient for that dimension 
and the similarity between the query and the 
document, calculated as the cosine similarity on 
the LSA space: 
Score D

where 
V D

, T

(
)
is 
the 
LSA 
coefficient 
for 
document 
D
k
in dimension 
T
j
and 
Sim D
k
, Q
(
)
is the cosine similarity between document 
D
k
and the query 
Q
, in the LSA space. 
Finally, we use a second threshold to filter these 
scores, obtaining the most similar documents for 
the 
query 
regarding 
each 
of 
the 
considered 
topics. 
3.4 Representative terms 
In order to represent each identified topic and 
facilitate the exploration of results by users we 
make use of the MeSH terms assigned to the 
documents by expert annotators. These indexing 
terms 
represent 
the 
major 
concepts 
in 
each 
Medline 
article, 
and 
therefore 
provide 
a 
semantic representation of the documents. The 
important aspect to consider is that we expect 
that each cluster of results represent a distinct 
topic 
or 
theme. 
Therefore, 
the 
documents 
assigned to each dimension, after the previous 
step, should not only be different but should 
also be focused on different themes. To evaluate 
this, we can compare the set of MeSH terms 
assigned to the documents in different topics to 
see how different they are. In order to do so, we 
first define an association score for each MeSH 
term 
in 
each 
topic, 
creating 
a 
vector 
representation that we then use to compare the 
topics.

To define the association score between a given 
topic and a MeSH term, we consider the LSA 
coefficient of each document in that topic that 
contains that MeSH term, as well as the relative 
ranking of the document in that dimension. The 
ranking is an important factor since the value of 
the coefficients for the most relevant documents 
may 
vary 
significantly 
across 
different 
dimensions, 
and 
we 
want 
to 
force 
that 
if 
a 
MeSH term is assigned to the top ten documents 
in a topic, it should have a higher score for that 
topic than for a topic where it is assigned to 
lower ranking documents. Therefore, we define 
the 
association 
score 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
document 
coefficients, 
normalized 
by 
the 
ranking of that document within that topic:

Results and discussion 
Using the methods proposed in the previous 
section, it is possible to organize the literature 
search results into separate lists, each associated 
to a certain theme. Different numbers of LSA 
dimensions were considered, varying from 100 
to 400. There was no significant variation in the 
results, 
and 
here 
results 
are 
shown 
for 
100 
dimensions. The documents retrieved by LSA 
similarity will be distributed across these topics, 
allowing an easier navigation. Also, although a 
given document may occur in more than one 
topic, which is expected since articles discuss 
interrelated subjects, it will appear in different 
ranking positions in each result list. Therefore, 
users looking at two different topics will see 
two different sets of results. This also justifies 
using the document ranking when calculating 
the score for each MeSH term and topic pair, 
since the most important results for the users are 
the top ones in each result list. Table 1 shows 
the first five results for the query “Dopamine”, 
in topics 12 and 25. As can be noticed, the 
results lists are significantly different between 
topics, illustrating how the retrieved results are 
organized around separate themes.

4.1 Inter-topic distances 
Given the topic description as a vector of MeSH 
terms and scores, we can visually analyze the 
differences 
or 
similarities 
between 
pairs 
of 
topics. 
Since 
MeSH 
terms 
are 
assigned 
to 
articles 
based 
on 
the 
full-text 
content, 
and 
represent the themes of the article, using this as 
a measure of semantic similarity between the 
topics is a logical choice. We define the inter-
topic distance as

where 
A 
and 
B 
are 
the 
MeSH 
term 
vector 
representations of topics j and k, respectively, 
with coefficients given by Eq. 2, and M is the 
number of distinct MeSH terms. Fig. 2 shows 
the inter-topic distances corresponding to the 
query 
term 
“Dopamine”, 
illustrated 
as 
a 
heatmap. 
The 
dendogram 
is 
also 
shown, 
allowing 
identifying 
the 
most 
similar 
topics. 
Such a representation helps identifying topics 
that are similar and those that are more distant. 
For example, topics 25 and 27 and topics 70 and 
72 are very similar between each other, and at 
the same time each pair is very different from 
the remaining topics. These similarities could 
arise 
from 
LSA 
dimensions 
which 
are 
somewhat overlapping or, more interestingly, to 
distinct but somehow related topics.

An intuitive way to represent the different topics 
in 
the 
results 
is 
by 
using 
multidimensional 
scaling (MDS), an exploratory technique used to 
visualize proximities in a low dimensional space 
[Van Deun et al., 2007]. It uses a set of data 
analysis methods to detect underlying relations 
between entities from a correlation matrix and 
represents them in a geometrical space, being 
possible to visualize those relations. The MDS 
algorithm starts by determining the specified 
topics and initial coordinate matrix, followed by 
calculating the distances between the several 
entities in the matrix. The next step relies on 
optimizing the matrix scale using a measure of 
goodness-of-fit referred to as stress. After this 
evaluation the coordinates are updated and the 
scale is optimized once again. This process is 
repeated until the stress is minimized. Using 
MDS, 
the 
documents 
or 
the 
topics 
resulting 
from 
a 
search 
can 
be 
displayed 
on 
a 
two-
dimensional 
space, 
where 
they 
appear 
distributed according to their similarities. Fig. 3 
shows 
the 
result 
of 
MDS 
for 
the 
query 
“Dopamine”, using the LSA cosine similarity 
between each pair of documents. Only the top 
20 documents in each topic were considered. 
Each 
document 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
circle, 
coloured according to the topic that document 
belongs to; black circles represent documents 
assigned to more than one topic. Although some 
separation is lost due to the reduction to two 
dimensions, some clusters of documents from 
the 
same 
topic 
are 
still 
apparent. 
This 
representation, used within a literature retrieval 
system, 
would 
allow 
users 
to 
navigate 
the 
results 
while 
visualizing 
the 
relations 
or 
similarities between the resulting documents. 
4.3 Word clouds 
Another way of visualizing the results of LSA is 
by 
representing 
the 
topics 
by 
word 
clouds. 
Word 
clouds 
are 
popularly 
used 
as 
a 
visual 
representation for textual data, with each word 
differing 
in 
size, 
colour, 
position 
or 
font, 
depending on a weight, usually defined by its 
frequency 
in 
a 
document 
or 
collection 
of 
documents. 
For 
LSA, 
one 
could 
use 
the 
coefficient for each word in a LSA dimension, 
illustrating the words that better describe that 
dimension. However, for our proposed aim, this 
would not suffice, as this representation would 
not be associated with the searched query. 
Fig. 3. Distribution of documents in the geometrical space created by MDS. The top 20 documents for each topic relevant for 
the query “Dopamine” are shown. The colour of the circle indicates the topic to which the document is assigned; black circles 
indicate documents assigned to more than one topic.

Instead, we want that the word cloud for a topic 
reflect the most important terms for that topic 
given the specific query. Therefore, we follow 
the same approach as before, and represent the 
most 
significant 
MeSH 
terms 
for 
resulting 
documents assigned to that topic. In this case, 
we want the word cloud for a topic to reflect the 
most important terms for that topic given the 
specific 
query. 
Therefore, 
we 
use 
the 
most 
significant MeSH terms for resulting documents 
assigned 
to 
that 
topic. 
Fig. 
4 
illustrates 
the 
MeSH term cloud corresponding to topics 12 
and 25 for the query ``Dopamine''. From the 
most 
prominent 
terms, 
one 
can 
identify 
that 
topic 
12 
is 
about 
physiology 
and 
physiopathology in Huntington's disease, while 
topic 25 is mostly about receptors, transport and 
metabolism 
of 
Dopamine. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
emphasize that, although the LSA dimensions 
are defined for the entire corpus and are kept 
constant, the word cloud for this same topic 
would 
be 
different 
for 
a 
different 
query, 
as 
given by the score defined in Eq. 2. Combining 
this type of visualization with the MDS result 
described in the previous section would give 
users of a literature retrieval system a rich view 
of the information contained in their results, 
facilitating its exploration.

Conclusions 
We have described an approach for structuring 
the results of a literature search based on the 
latent semantic information extracted from the 
documents in a corpus, as expressed by LSA. 
Fig. 3. MeSH term cloud for topics 12 and 25 showing the most relevant terms in these topics for the query “Dopamine”. The size 
of the font is proportional to the score of that term for the topic and query combination. The cloud was created in the Wordle 
website (http://www.wordle.net/)

Moreover, we show how the results of LSA can 
be 
adapted 
so 
as 
to 
evidence 
differences 
between results of different queries and propose 
several 
visualization 
techniques 
that 
can 
be 
applied to explore these results. Further work 
is 
required 
for 
evaluating 
how 
users 
would 
benefit from the proposed solutions. Although 
objective evaluation of methods such as the one 
proposed 
here 
is 
usually 
very 
difficult, 
the 
results 
presented 
indicate 
that 
methods 
for 
structuring 
literature 
search 
results, 
used 
in 
combination within a literature retrieval system, 
could empower users with tools for literature 
guided knowledge exploration and discovery.
