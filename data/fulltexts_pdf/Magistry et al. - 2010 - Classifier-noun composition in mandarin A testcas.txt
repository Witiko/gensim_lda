Genesis
Start from a formal
semantics study trying to account for
coercion in the classiﬁer-noun composition
Interested in the DSM track for
bringing some empirical
support
complement the view on lexical
type
more generally bringing together two worlds in which we had
been working
But we are ”beginners” in DSM approach
This talk:
what has been done (including errors and wrong ways)
what we would like to do (or to see done)

Measure words
[Tang, 2005]:
Classiﬁers and measure are not easy to separate on syntactic
grounds
treat them as one syntactic category (量詞 liang4ci2)
Some forms can be noun or classiﬁer, but as noun they require
a (diﬀerent) classiﬁer
They diﬀer a lot on the semantic perspective
[Cheng and Sybesma, 1998]:
Classiﬁer:
[+sortal] selects some salient feature or property
Measure words:
[-sortal]

Why DSM?
Recap:
Lots of rather contradictory propositions
seems to never exhaust the question (because of accidental
association and creative use?)
Proposal
from rich typing system but what are exactly the
types:
previous slides, ”ontological
semantic” approach
Here, explore the possibility of using Vectors as Types
At least to get empirical
support on our lexical
typing
distinction
As for classiﬁers, validate an existing classiﬁcation or propose a
new one?
But, classiﬁers deeply link to the noun ❀ Compositionality

Sorting out classiﬁers
[Chen, 1999] has 12 classes grounded on very ﬁne-grained
distinction:
shape, function, location, social
status, ...
[Huang and Ahrens, 2003] distinguishes 3 main classes of nominal
classiﬁers:
.
.
.
1
individual
(174)
.
.
.
2
kind (14)
.
.
.
3
event (35)
They also have 4 classes of measure words
.
.
.
1
proximation
.
.
.
2
container
.
.
.
3
standard
.

activity
[Prevot and Hsieh, 2010], considered only a sub part of these
classiﬁers and proposed :

Why CL interesting for DSM and compositionality?
Not a lot of variation among semantic types
❀ Spaces involved intuitively easier to compare:
Cl:
hh
e, t
i
,
h
e, t
ii
N:
h
e, t
i
“CL N” :
h
e, t
i
There are compositionality issues but the vectors that need to
be combined are more similar than, e.g, predicate-argument
combination

segmentation of the text ( tokenization)
Mandarin has no ”blank” character
a text is a continuous ﬂow of characters
but a character is NOT a word
most “words” in a text (tokens) are made of two chars
most “words” in a lexicon (types) are made of three chars
naive native speaker don’t agree on where one would put
spaces
Mandarin have very ﬂexible POS system and (almost?) no
ﬂectional
morphems
highly ambiguous POS tagging

Distinction between Cl.

is good (but DSM may
be an overkill
to do this)
our Spaces seems totally unrelated to the 12 classes of Chen
based on our event/massiﬁer/units/sortal
lists, only units are
clearly categorized in our clusters
.
Comments

Clusters don’t match semantic types, but tend to be more
thematic or domain-related
Model
parameter estimation is challenging
need of a good test-set and procedure for evaluation (no gold,
no task)
we want N , Cl
and Compounds to be in the same space

p :
resulting vector for the compound
f
:
composition function
u, v :

R :
Relation between u and v .
p should correspond the vector of the compound in isolation, we
already know u, v and R is assumed to be uniform.

.

conclusion
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Semantic types were hard (if possible) to ﬁnd based only on
Classiﬁer vectors
Looking at their relative position to the Nouns seems more
relevant (but we need a more signiﬁcant amount of data to
assert it)
projection Compounds into a semantic space can be done (at
least for some kind of compounds)

Current issues on compositionality in DSM
(at least) Two interesting tracks explored:
[Erk and Pado, 2008] Work on the vectors representing the
lemma meaning, each lemma has:
.
.
.
1
its own vector
.
.
.
2
a set of vectors corresponding to the set of dependance
relations (e.
subject, object, subject
−1
,...) it can enters in (as
dependant or dominant)
Work on the operation combining the vectors
[Mitchell
and Lapata, 2008]
Here we did not want posit theoretical
distinction of relations
between CL and N ❀ work rather on the combination operation
Beneﬁt:
The result can be compared with the “CL N” vector
which is in the same space as the “N” alone.

Analysis of the results
Technical
issue:
to avoid noise, collected a speciﬁc set of data, might
introduce a bias
Linguistic issue:
Semantics of bare nouns are completely diﬀerent from
classiﬁed Nouns .
Semantic agreement vs.
coercion
Methodological
issue:
To capture the relevant meaning diﬀerence among classiﬁers,
the way to build the DSM space might be more subtle
later go more towards an approach a la [Erk and Pado, 2008]?

Semantic agreement and coercion
Diﬀerent cases:
.
.
.
1
CL.machine + N.car (subtype):
~
CL and
~
N are similar
.
.
.
2
CL.event + N.car :
~
CL and
~
N diﬀer strongly
.
.
.
3
CL.kind + N.car:
~
CL and
~
N diﬀer strongly (but diﬀerently)
In cases 2-3, CL coerces N: conﬁrms hypothesis that head has a
stronger weight in the composition operation, e.g
[Mitchell
and Lapata, 2008]:
~
c
=
0.95
×
~
pred
+
0.05
×
~
pred
×
~
arg
In case 1, there is no coercion
Can such diﬀerent kinds of composition be realized by the same
operation in the same semantic space?
Other option:
have diﬀerent spaces for
~
cl
and
~
n

A space for each POS?
Main issue:
NP → N|DET CL N|... ; VP → V |V NP|...
❀ more trouble for identifying dimensions later in the
compositions
+ issues on normalisation accross diﬀerent semantic spaces
really need to enter into non-blind dimension reduction (if
doable at all)
in order to match dimension (or group of dimensions) with
semantic features

Conclusion
Preliminary study on DSM on a new kind of problem
Track followed:
to gather CL and N in the same semantic
space
Major issues while building the semantic spaces
Possible to build diﬀerent space for each category
Compositionality become harder to approach, in particular
dimension reduction cannot remain a ”black-box”
Open question:
is it even realistic to address (formal
semantics)
compositionality issues on lemmatized ”content”-words corpora.
