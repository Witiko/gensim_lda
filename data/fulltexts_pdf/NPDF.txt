ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I am incredibly grateful
to my colleagues,
friends,
and family for all
of the various forms
of
support they have provided during the process of
writing this dissertation.
First,
I
would like to thank my committee members Peter Todd, Brian O’Donnell, Tom Busey, and
Jerome Busemeyer for their helpful comments, useful advice, and oversight throughout the
dissertation process.
Mike Jones was also an essential contributor to the early stages of this
work and I am thankful both for his insight as the project developed and for his willingness
to allow me to use the semantic priming and verbal ﬂuency data.
I would also like to thank
Bill
Hetrick and Brian O’Donnell
for their role in running the laboratories in which these
data were collected,
as well
as the research assistants who ran the experiments,
and the
participants who volunteered their time.
Jon Willits provided the Wikipedia corpus and
gave me some helpful
advice regarding training semantic space models.
I’d also like to
note that Jon played a large role in getting me interested in cognitive modeling to begin
with during my days as an undergraduate research assistant at UC Riverside.
Abby Carter
and Sarah Fischer spent many hours in the lab coding the audio recordings of the verbal
ﬂuency tasks and I appreciate their committment to doing this job in a timely and accurate
manner.
My colleagues Andrew Nystrom and Skyler Grammer were both incredibly helpful
with programming issues and our regular coﬀee breaks kept me sane and alert during
many weeks of inadequate sleep and constant programming.
I am particularly thankful to
Skyler both for encouraging me to use L
A
T
E
X and for putting up with me talking about
my dissertation progress nearly every morning before work.
This dissertation would also
iv
PREVIEW
not have been possible without the use of the Big Red II supercomputer,
allowing me to
perform years worth of
computations in about 3 days.
The high performance computing
support staﬀ at UITS provided swift technical
assistance that allowed me to utilize this
system for my research.
Due to my use of Big Red II, this research was supported in part by
Lilly Endowment, Inc., through its support for the Indiana University Pervasive Technology
Institute, and in part by the Indiana METACyt Initiative.
The Indiana METACyt Initiative
at IU is also supported in part by Lilly Endowment, Inc.
In addition to the direct contributions to this project by those listed above, many other
people helped indirectly by providing moral
support.
In particular,
I would like to thank
Paul
Toth and the Dissertation Support Group at CAPS for providing a space to discuss
dissertation-related issues and for teaching me skills that helped to keep this project on
track.
My mother and father,
Lillian Vences and Ken Matthews were very supportive
throughout my time in graduate school,
as they always have been.
I have them to thank
for raising me with a strong value for education and hard work and I have been incredibly
lucky to have both of
them as parents.
My aunt Virginia Burley was also quite helpful
throughout this process,
oﬀering her wisdom and support to get me through many rough
patches.
I would also like to thank John Putz both for housing me on my many trips back
to Bloomington and for being a great friend throughout graduate school.
My cousin David
Vences and friend Kenny Highsmith both kept me sane through many long stretches of
coding and writing by reminding me to laugh and take things less seriously.
My friend and
colleague Sarah Forster and I spent many weekends working on our dissertations together
in coﬀee shops around the twin cities and made working on the weekend every weekend
far more tolerable.
I am also deeply thankful for my partner, friend, and colleague Jerillyn
Kent.
Jeri has played a role in nearly every portion of the project including but not limited
to helping collect the data,
brainstorming about how to analyze the data and interpret
v

results,
dissertating side by side on countless nights and weekends,
providing emotional
support, believing in me even when I did not, and putting up with me talking about data
analysis during long walks that were supposed to be dissertation breaks.
Her companionship
has been invaluable throughout the many years that we have been together and her cheerful
disposition, sharp scientiﬁc mind, and loving heart made it possible for me to complete this
work.
I am incredibly grateful for everything she has done to help me through this process.
Finally, though it may seem a bit silly I would like to thank our beloved beagle Gracie for
napping dutifully at my side through many long days and nights of dissertating, for keeping
me calm, and for reminding me to get outside and enjoy life.

USING SEMANTIC SPACE MODELS TO QUANTIFY SEMANTIC MEMORY
DYSFUNCTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
Abnormalities in semantic memory have been observed in individuals with schizophrenia
using a wide variety of memory tasks.
Analyses of results in many of these tasks either
rely upon representations of semantic structure constructed by researchers (e.g.
Troyer et
al., 1997) or representations derived from patients that may reﬂect confounds associated
with the task used to construct the representation.
Semantic space models such as LSA
and BEAGLE avoid these issues, learning semantic representations from patterns of
co-occurrence and word order in large text corpora.
In this dissertation, representations
learned by these models were utilized to model behavior in two semantic memory tasks in
order to characterize semantic memory dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia.
A
hierarchical Bayesian instantiation of the drift diﬀusion model (Ratcliﬀ, 1978; Wiecki
2013) was used to model a lexical decision task.
vii
PREVIEW
Results were consistent with an account of decreases in the rate of information
accumulation in semantic memory in addition to general slowing of reaction times in
individuals with schizophrenia, as opposed to the hyperpriming frequently observed in this
population.
Verbal ﬂuency tasks were also modeled using semantic representations learned
by BEAGLE and LSA, and models of memory retrieval related to SAM (Raaijmakers &
Shiﬀrin, 1981) and ACT-R (Anderson, 1993).
While the paths taken through semantic
space by non-psychiatric controls were best modeled with the use of a dynamic retrieval
cue that switched between word frequency for global search and semantic similarity for
local search, static cue models that incorporate both word frequency and semantic
similarity were a better ﬁt for individuals with schizophrenia.
Furthermore, predictions
regarding behavior on the semantic ﬂuency task derived from optimal foraging theory
were found to hold equally well for controls and patients.
Patterns of results across both
experiments indicate semantic dysfunction beyond general slowing in this population
consistent with semantic inhibition.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction
1.1
Semantic Memory Dysfunction in Schizophrenia
Semantic abnormalities are often thought to be a core symptom of
schizophrenia,
dating
back to Bleuler (1911/1950) hypothesizing that a “loosening of associations” in this popu-
lation was responsible for disordered thinking and speech.
Individuals with schizophrenia
presenting with these symptoms have diﬃculty with the use of semantic and relational as-
pects of language, often exhibiting an abnormally high number of derailments, irrelevant or
tangential responses, intrinsic illogicalities, or other types of disorganization when attempt-
ing to communicate with others (Andreasen,
1979).
It has been hypothesized that these
abnormalities in discourse result, at least in part, from dysfunction in the semantic memory
system (e.g., Aloia, Gourovitch, Weinberger, & Goldberg, 1996).
Semantic memory is typically deﬁned as an individual’s long-term store of information
about word meanings,
facts,
concepts,
and general
knowledge about the world (e.g.,
Tul-
ving,
1972).
While individuals with schizophrenia have been shown to exhibit impaired
performance on tests of
real-world knowledge (Cutting & Murphy,
1988),
the pattern of
results observed in other tasks designed to test the functioning of the semantic memory sys-
tem suggests abnormalities that can not be described by a simple concept of impairment.
For example,
observations of
abnormally large facilitation eﬀects (or “hyperpriming”) as
compared to healthy controls in semantic priming experiments have led some researchers
1
PREVIEW
to hypothesize that activation may spread more extensively through semantic representa-
tions (see Minzenberg, Ober, & Vinogradov, 2002, for a review).
Furthermore, evidence for
abnormal
or disorganized category structure in semantic memory has been found using a
number of other tasks including verbal
ﬂuency (Allen,
Liddle,
& Frith,
1993;
Gourovitch,
Goldberg,
& Weinberger,
1996;
McKay et al.,
1996;
Elvev˚ag,
Weinstock,
Akil,
Kleinman,
& Goldberg,
2001),
category veriﬁcation (Chen,
Wilkins,
& McKenna,
1994),
and sorting
(McKay et al., 1996; Lawrence, Doughty, Al-Mousawi, Clegg, & Done, 2007).
1.2
Modeling Semantic Structure
While a great deal of progress has been made in characterizing semantic memory abnormal-
ities in individuals with schizophrenia, many of the analyses employed in these studies rely
on the researcher’s own judgments of semantic similarity or category structure (e.g., Robert
et al., 1998).
In addition to the signiﬁcant time cost associated with using measures based
on hand-coding of category structure, the experimenter’s judgments of category boundaries
may not match those of individuals with schizophrenia (Chen et al., 1994; Aloia et al., 1996;
Elvev˚ag, Fisher, Gurd, & Goldberg, 2002).
Attempts have been made to address these issues
by having participants deﬁne their own category structure (e.g., Elvev˚ag et al., 2002) or by
attempting to recover category structure indirectly from performance on semantic memory
tasks (e.g., Aloia et al., 1996; Paulsen et al., 1996), but there are signiﬁcant methodological
issues with both of these approaches.
For example, asking participants to deﬁne their own
category structure by sorting items that they produced during a verbal
ﬂuency task into
piles of semantically related items (Elvev˚ag et al.,
2002) artiﬁcially restricts each item to
belonging only to a single category (see section 1.4.1 for further discussion of sorting tasks).
Recovering semantic structure indirectly from inter-item production distances in verbal ﬂu-
ency tasks avoids these problems, but the method of estimating semantic similarity typically
2
PREVIEW
employed in these studies (Chan et al., 1993) requires many productions of an exemplar in
order to obtain stable semantic distance estimates between words.
As a result, this method
is only able to recover the category structure of high frequency words that are produced by
many participants, ignoring any possibility of disorganization in lower frequency words.
One promising alternative is to use memory representations from semantic space mod-
els (SSMs) to characterize the nature of
semantic memory disturbances in schizophrenia.
Though there are many diﬀerent implementations of these models, fundamentally they are
all
expressions of the distributional
hypothesis:
the idea that words that occur in similar
contexts are likely to have similar meanings (Firth,
1957;
Harris,
1970).
For example,
the
words
hammer
and
nail
may co-occur frequently in language, suggesting that they are se-
mantically related.
In addition, although the words
hammer
and
mallet
may not co-occur
frequently,
they typically appear in very similar contexts.
Many modern computational
models of semantic representation exploit these types of statistical regularities in large text
corpora in order to learn semantic memory representations for each word appearing in the
corpus.
After training, the result is a memory representation in which each word is repre-
sented as a vector in a high-dimensional semantic space, where words with similar meanings
tend to cluster near each other.
The lexical
semantic representations created by these models have been used to simu-
late a wide range of psycholinguistic phenomena including judgments of semantic similarity
(Landauer & Dumais, 1997), semantic priming (Lund & Burgess, 1996; Jones & Mewhort,
2007),
and free association (Griﬃths,
Steyvers,
& Tenenbaum,
2007).
Crucially,
these
models have the ability to recognize latent semantic similarities between phrases or doc-
uments without the need for keyword overlap or human-deﬁned ontologies.
For example,
the sentences “The doctor operated on the patient” and “The physician performed a sur-
gical
procedure” would be rated as highly similar despite the fact that they use diﬀerent
3
PREVIEW
words to describe the same act.
This property of semantic space models has made them
particularly useful for applications that rely on the understanding of meaning in documents
such as automated essay scoring systems (Landauer,
Laham,
& Foltz,
2003) and indexing
of documents for search (Deerwester, Dumais, Landauer, Furnas, & Harshman, 1990).

Purpose of Dissertation
The purpose of this dissertation is to examine semantic memory dysfunction in individuals
with schizophrenia using semantic space models as both a useful metric for semantic simi-
larity and as a representational
assumption that can be used to build cognitive models of
semantic memory tasks.
This expands upon previous applications of semantic space models
in investigations of semantic abnormalities in schizophrenia in two main ways.
First,
behavior on semantic memory tasks will
be modeled using process models that
operate on the memory representations learned by semantic space models.
Existing ap-
plications of
semantic space models for understanding semantic memory dysfunction in
schizophrenia (e.g.,
Elvev˚ag,
Foltz,
Weinberger,
& Goldberg,
2007) rely solely on cosine
similarity or other distance metrics derived from semantic space representations.
Building
cognitive models,
ﬁtting them to experimental
data,
and performing model
comparisons
will
allow for an examination of
how diﬀerent sources of
information are utilized during
semantic memory tasks, providing insight into the nature of semantic memory dysfunction
in individuals with schizophrenia.
Second, using semantic representations learned by BEAGLE (Jones & Mewhort, 2007)
in addition to representations learned by LSA will
allow for an examination of
the role
that order information may play in these tasks.
Word order is an important source of
information in language that tends to reﬂect information about lexical class and conceptual
substitutability in addition to semantic relatedness.
For example, the words
bee
and
wasp
4
PREVIEW
would be very similar in word order space because they occur in similar positions with
respect to other words in sentences as a result of the fact that they both refer to ﬂying insects
that sting.
In contrast,
contextual
co-occurrence information tends to reﬂect associative
relationships between concepts.
In a context-based semantic representation, the words
bee
and
honey
would be similar as a result of their associative relationship even though they
diﬀer with respect to animacy and many other characteristics.
Learning lexical
semantic representations from distributional
statistics in text corpora
using BEAGLE allows for contextual
co-occurrence based representations and word order
based representations to be built separately.
Each of these types of information may then
be utilized independently by computational
models of semantic memory tasks in order to
measure the degree to which each participant relied on these types of information during the
memory tasks.
For example, consider a semantic ﬂuency task in which participants are asked
to generate as many items as possible from a given semantic category in a set amount of
time.
Using semantic representations from BEAGLE in combination with a simple process
model, Johns et al. (2013) found that word order information was more predictive of search
patterns generated by participants than context information due to the fact that this type
of
information is inherently more useful
for the semantic ﬂuency task (see chapter 3 for
further discussion).
If activation is spreading more extensively through semantic memory
representations in individuals with schizophrenia,
we might expect to observe more use of
context information in this task in these individuals as compared to healthy controls.
The utility of this approach will be demonstrated using a semantic priming task and a
semantic verbal ﬂuency task, allowing for an examination of both recognition and recall in
semantic memory.
Semantic priming will be modeled using a hierarchical Bayesian instan-
tiation of the drift diﬀusion model
(Ratcliﬀ,
1978;
Wiecki,
Sofer,
& Frank,
2013) in order
to utilize the shape of the full reaction time distribution to model individual components of
5
PREVIEW
the lexical decision process.
The eﬀect of semantic similarity between target and prime on
drift rates in the drift diﬀusion model framekwork will also be calculated using each of the
three semantic space models.
Verbal
ﬂuency tasks will
be modeled using a modiﬁed Luce
choice axiom (Luce,
1959) as a process model,
allowing for an examination of
how word
frequency and semantic information captured by each SSM are utilized during this task.
Furthermore,
both tasks will
be administered to the same group of participants,
allowing
for an examination of relationships between semantic variables derived from each task.
The remainder of
this chapter will
be split into two main sections:
a review of
the
empirical
evidence for semantic memory deﬁcits in schizophrenia (withholding review of
verbal
ﬂuency and semantic priming experiments for their respective chapters),
and an
overview of
the semantic space models that will
be used as representational
assumptions
throughout the dissertation, setting the stage for the analyses in future chapters.

Review of Semantic Dysfunction in Schizophrenia
1.4.1
Category Veriﬁcation and Sorting
Category veriﬁcation and sorting tasks are perhaps the most direct methods of examining
the organization of the semantic memory system.
In a category veriﬁcation task,
partici-
pants are asked to decide whether or not words belong to a particular conceptual category.
These words vary in their degree of semantic relationship to the category,
allowing abnor-
malities at various levels of semantic relatedness to be detected.
Sorting tasks, on the other
hand,
assess semantic organization by asking participants to sort exemplars into piles of
related items.
This allows for the direct observation of
categorical
knowledge,
but inher-
ently restricts categories to be non-overlapping and makes no distinction between typical,
atypical, and borderline category members.
Chen et al. (1994) used a semantic categorization paradigm to examine the integrity of
6
PREVIEW
the semantic memory system in individuals with schizophrenia.
Stimuli
for each category
were grouped into 5 membership types:
typical category members, atypical category mem-
bers,
borderline members,
related but still
outside category,
and unrelated items.
Chen
et al.
found that individuals with schizophrenia diﬀered from controls in two ways.
First,
they were slower to make category membership decisions regardless of the typicality of the
stimulus with respect to the given category.
This is unsurprising,
as it is widely accepted
that individuals with schizophrenia perform poorly on nearly all cognitive tasks (Chapman
& Chapman, 1973), and are generally slower on reaction time measures (Yates, 1973).
Sec-
ond,
there was a signiﬁcant group by membership type interaction in reaction times.
For
controls, reaction times were the lowest in the typical condition, slightly higher in the atyp-
ical condition, and peaked at the borderline condition before decreasing successively in the
related condition and the unrelated condition.
Individuals with schizophrenia, on the other
hand, exhibited a diﬀerent pattern of reaction times:
while the reaction time steadily rose
between the typical
and borderline conditions,
it peaked for the related condition before
decreasing slightly in the unrelated condition.
In addition,
individuals with schizophrenia
were more likely to include borderline,
related,
and unrelated items in the category than
controls.
Chen et al.
interpreted this result as a disorder of category structure such that
internal category structure is preserved while category boundaries shift outward or become
more diﬀuse.
Rossell
and David (2006) extended on the method of
Chen et al.
(1994) by including
high and low frequency category exemplars and testing over multiple sessions in order to
determine whether the apparent loosening of category boundaries was due to a disorder of
access or storage.
Individuals with schizophrenia were found to be less accurate on the task
than controls, had more diﬃculty with low frequency items than controls even when IQ was
used as a covariate, and performed consistently over multiple administrations of the task.
7
PREVIEW
Sorting tasks have also indicated a dysfunctional
semantic memory system (McKay et
al., 1996; Lawrence et al., 2007).
Lawrence et al. administered a free sorting task known as
the Category Generation Task (CGT; Green, Done, Anthony, McKenna, & Ochocki, 2004)
as a part of a study examining the relationship between executive dysfunction and distorted
semantic category boundaries.
In the CGT, participants are given 45 cards with black and
white pictures from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) set containing exemplars from 5
taxonomic categories (fruit, vehicles, animals, body parts, and clothing).
They are then in-
structed to sort the cards into piles of “things that they feel go together”, with no restriction
on the number of piles.
Both overinclusions (deﬁned as grouping two or more items from
diﬀerent taxonomic categories together) and underinclusions (deﬁned as grouping members
of a single taxonomic category into two or more piles) were calculated after sorting.
Individ-
uals with schizophrenia were signiﬁcantly more likely to both overinclude and underinclude
than either healthy controls or individuals with acquired brain injuries presenting with a
primary dysexecutive syndrome.
In addition, no correlations were found between either un-
derinclusion or overinclusion and measures of intelligence or executive dysfunction.
While
this may indicate category disturbance in individuals with schizophrenia, it is also possible
that the observed increase in overinclusion and underinclusion was the result of an inability
to inhibit irrelevant information (Leeson, Simpson, McKenna, & Laws, 2005).
Indeed, this
seems to be the case when examining the abnormal card sorts generated by individuals with
schizophrenia,
as they contain many ad-hoc categories with varying degrees of agreement
with the taxonomic categories.
One way to test the integrity of
categorical
information that is less likely to encour-
age the generation of
ad-hoc categories is through the use of
a structured sorting task.
McKay et al. (1996) administered a structured sorting task as part of the Semantic Mem-
ory Test Battery (Hodges,
Salmon,
& Butters,
1992).
In this task,
participants are asked
8
PREVIEW
to sort 48 cards into diﬀerent categories on three diﬀerent levels:
living vs.
manmade,
the superordinate/category level, and the subordinate/attributional level.
Individuals with
schizophrenia performed worse on the task than controls at every level of semantic hierarchy,
but the diﬀerence was only statistically signiﬁcant at the subordinate level (e.g.
classifying
animals as
ﬁerce
vs
non-ﬁerce
).
This suggests that categorical information is largely intact
at the higher levels of semantic hierarchy,
but that ﬁne-grained category information may
be corrupted.
This type of
bottom up deterioration is often interpreted as a degradation of
seman-
tic memory representations.
One set of
criteria commonly used to distinguish between
impaired access and degraded storage was developed by E.
K.
Warrington and Shallice
(1979).
According to their deﬁnition, disorders resulting from degraded memory represen-
tations are characterized by:
(1) consistency of response to the same item over time; (2) the
corruption of
low-frequency items before high-frequency items;
(3) greater impairment of
subordinate/attributional
information as compared to superordinate information;
and (4)
ineﬀectiveness of cueing techniques for facilitation of access.
In contrast, disorders of access
are characterized by:
(1) an inconsistent pattern of response to the same item in repeated
testing; (2) a weak eﬀect of item frequency/familiarity on retrieval similar to that observed
in controls; (3) the absence of systematic diﬀerences between the loss of subordinate infor-
mation and superordinate information; and (4) improved retrieval with cueing.
Overall, it seems that categorization tasks and sorting tasks indicate a storage deﬁcit in
the semantic memory system in individuals with schizophrenia that goes beyond category
disturbances resulting from dysfunction in executive processes.
The ﬁnding of
expanded
or loosened category boundaries by Chen et al.
(1994) ﬁts with the early descriptions of
“loosening of
associations” (Bleuler,
1911/1950) and “overinclusive thinking” (Cameron,
1939) in schizophrenia, but this may not tell the whole story.
Lawrence et al. (2007) found
9
PREVIEW
an increase in both overinclusion and underinclusion in categorization,
but the tendency
of
individuals with schizophrenia to generate ad-hoc categories may have contributed to
this result.
Further research is necessary to determine the exact nature of the warping of
category boundaries in individuals with schizophrenia.
It is of particular interest that sub-
ordinate category information seems to be corrupted while leaving higher levels of semantic
categorization mostly intact (McKay et al., 1996), as this seems to indicate a storage deﬁcit
and is a type of degeneration often reported in dementia (e.g., Done & Gale, 1997).
1.4.2
Picture Naming
The naming of pictures or line drawings of objects is frequently used as a test of semantic
memory (e.g., Hodges et al., 1992).
Several studies have employed picture naming tasks in
order to examine semantic memory deﬁcits in schizophrenia (Barr,
Bilder,
Goldberg,
Ka-
plan, & Mukherjee, 1989; McKay et al., 1996; Laws, Mortimer, & Al-Uzri, 2004; Lawrence
et al., 2007).
Barr et al. found that individuals with schizophrenia produced more semantic
naming errors than controls using the Boston Naming Test (
Boston Naming Test
,
1976).
IQ has been found to correlate highly with naming ability (e.g., E. Warrington & McKenna,
1983), but McKay et al. (1996) and (Laws, Al-Uzri, & Mortimer, 2000) found that individ-
uals with schizophrenia exhibited deﬁcits on picture naming tasks even when IQ was added
as a covariate.
However, Lawrence et al. (2007) found that diﬀerences between controls and
patients became nonsigniﬁcant when diﬀerences in IQ were taken into account.
1.4.3
Word-Picture Matching
Word-picture matching tasks such as the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (Dunn & Dunn,
2009) require participants to listen to a verbal cue and then select the picture it is associated
with from a number of similar alternatives.
These tasks are generally considered tests of
recognition (J.
Marshall,
Pound,
White-Thomson,
& Pring,
1990) in contrast to picture
10
PREVIEW
naming tasks,
which are tests of
recall.
Several
studies have failed to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between individuals with schizophrenia and controls on word-picture matching
tasks (McKay et al., 1996; Laws et al., 2004; Barrera, McKenna, & Berrios, 2005; Lawrence
et al., 2007).
In addition, no signiﬁcant correlation was observed between symptom severity
and performance on word-matching tasks in these studies.
However,
Gurd,
Elvevag,
and
Cortina-Borja (1997) found evidence for impairment on word-picture naming tasks,
and a
recent meta-analysis also suggests that individuals with schizophrenia are impaired on these
tasks (Doughty & Done, 2009).
1.4.4
Semantic Association
Tests of semantic association such as the Pyramids and Palm Trees Test (Howard & Patter-
son, 1992), and the Camel and Cactus Test (Bozeat, Ralph, Patterson, Garrard, & Hodges,
2000) have also been used to examine semantic deﬁcits in schizophrenia.
In these tests,
participants are asked to determine which object from a set of four options best matches
a given object.
For example,
one trial
of the Camel
and Cactus test asks participants to
match a camel
to one of four diﬀerent types of vegetation:
cactus (the target),
rose,
sun-
ﬂower,
or tree.
Semantic association tests can be administered using either words or pic-
tures as stimuli.
The evidence for impairment on semantic association tasks in individuals
with schizophrenia is mixed, with some studies ﬁnding signiﬁcant impairment (Rodriguez-
Ferrera,
McCarthy,
& McKenna,
2001;
Barrera et al.,
2005;
Lawrence et al.,
2007),
and
some ﬁnding no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between patients and controls (Stirling,
Hellewell,
Blakey,
& Deakin,
2006;
Vogel
et al.,
2009).
In addition,
a recent meta-analysis suggests
that individuals with schizophrenia are impaired on semantic association tasks (Doughty &
Done, 2009).

Review of Semantic Space Models
1.5.1
Latent Semantic Analysis
The most well-known and inﬂuential
distributional
model
of
lexical
semantics is Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA;
Landauer & Dumais,
1997).
Like all
semantic space models,
LSA constructs a high-dimensional
vector representation of
words by operating on the
distributional
statistics of
language present in a large corpus of
words.
First,
a
word
x
context
matrix is constructed such that each row in the matrix corresponds to a word in the
corpus, and each column corresponds to a particular context.
The entries in this matrix are
simply counts of how many times each word occurs in each context.
Though it is possible
to deﬁne context in a number of diﬀerent ways, the typical implementation of LSA sets the
size of the contextual unit at the document level.
The next step in LSA is the computation of
a reduced-dimensionality representation
of the large
word
x
context
matrix.
This is performed using singular value decomposition
(SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of the matrix while retaining as much of the information
present in the matrix as possible.
In eﬀect, this step collapses across the raw co-occurrence
values in similar contexts to create a more abstract representation of the meaning of each
word.
This allows words that appear in similar contexts to cluster together in the reduced
multidimensional space regardless of whether or not they actually ever co-occurred in any
context in the corpus.
Landauer and Dumais argue that this is akin to creating a more
abstract representation of the meaning of a word from the raw co-occurrence data present
in the linguistic environment.
LSA has been successful at modeling a wide range of psycholinguistic phenomena, and
as such it has become a standard against which other semantic space models are tested.
Landauer and Dumais (1997) describe several
applications of LSA that show good ﬁts to
