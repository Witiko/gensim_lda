Abstract
Opinion Detection, Sentiment Analysis and User Attribute Detection from Online Text Data
by
Kasturi Bhattacharjee
With the growing increase in the use of the internet in most parts of the world today,
users
generate significant amounts of online text on different platforms such as online social net-
works,
product review websites,
travel blogs,
to name just a few.
The variety of content on
these platforms has made them an important resource for researchers to gauge user activity,
determine their opinions and analyze their behavior,
without
having to perform monetarily
and temporally expensive surveys.
Gaining insights into user behavior enables us to better
understand their likes and dislikes, which in turn is helpful for economic purposes such as mar-
keting, advertising and recommendations. Further, owing to the fact that online social networks
have recently been instrumental in socio-political revolutions such as the Arab Spring, and for
awareness-generation campaigns by MoveOn.org and Avaaz.org,
analysis of online data can
uncover user preferences.
The overarching goal of this Ph.D. thesis is to pose some research questions and propose
solutions,
mostly pertaining to user opinions and attributes,
keeping in mind the large quan-
tities of noise present in online textual data.
This thesis illustrates that with the extraction of
informative textual features and the use of robust NLP and machine learning techniques, it is
possible to perform efficient signal extraction from online text data,
and use it to better un-
derstand user behavior.
The first research problem addressed is that of opinion detection and
sentiment analysis of users on a given topic, from their self-generated tweets.
The key idea is
to select relevant hashtags and n-grams using an l
1
-regularized logistic regression model for
opinion detection.
The second research problem deals with temporal opinion detection from
x
PREVIEW
tweets, i.e., detecting user opinions on a topic in which the conversation evolves over time. For
instance, on the widely-discussed topic of Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act in the U.S.),
various issues became the focal points of discussion among users over time, as corresponding
socio-political events and occurrences took place in real-time. We propose a machine-learning
model based on seminal work from the sociological literature that is based on the premise that
most opinion changes occur slowly over time.
Our model is able to successfully capture opin-
ions over time using publicly available tweets, as well as to uncover the key points of discussion
as time progresses. In the third research problem, we utilize distributed representation of words
in a method that determines, from user reviews, aspects of products and services that users like
and dislike.
We harness the contextual similarity between words and effectively build meta-
features that capture user sentiment at a granular level. Finally in the fourth research problem,
we propose a method to detect the age of users from their publicly available tweets.
Using
a method based on distributed representation of words and clustering, we are able to achieve
high accuracies in age detection, as well as to simultaneously discover topics of conversation
in which users of different age groups engage.

are connected
by one or more types of relations [1,

Ever since the first human societies were formed,
social networks have been in existence and have played a role in influencing individual and
collective behavior.
However,
we have been experiencing a dramatic increase in the use and
popularity of online social network and other content generation platforms in the recent years.
The accessibility and widespread use of the Internet
in most
parts of the world has lead to
an enormous amount of content being generated on a daily basis by Internet users across the
world.
People generate content on a variety of platforms such as social networks (Facebook,
Twitter,
Pinterest),
review websites (TripAdvisor,
Yelp,
Amazon),
Web blogs,
and countless
others.
Figure 1.1 shows the tremendous increase in the usage of the Internet throughout the
world over the years, and Figure 1.2 illustrates the increase in popularity of social networking
sites.
These online platforms are used in a myriad of different ways.
For example, review web-
sites like Amazon [4], Yelp [5] and TripAdvisor [6] are used by people to publish reviews about
their purchases of products, places and services. These platforms help guide consumers in their
purchase-making decisions by providing them a view of similar purchases made by other peo-

ple.
On the other hand,
online social networks (OSNs) are used for other purposes,
ranging
from communicating with friends and family, obtaining a collated view of the news of the day,
advertising, etc. Further, these platforms have been recently used for socio-political reasons as
well. For instance, Facebook and Twitter proved to be effective mediums of communication for
protesters during the Arab Spring, enabling them to coordinate and conduct a revolution [7].
The massive popularity of social networks has led to their extensive use in political campaigns
as well [8].
Further, social and political organizations such as MoveOn.org [9] and Avaaz.org
[10] have emerged as platforms through which people start online petitions to increase public
awareness on a myriad of important social and political issues.
The variety of ways in which
online platforms are used today makes them an interesting and important resource for studying
user opinions and behaviour.
1.1
Importance of online user content as a research domain
This section highlights a few reasons why studying user-generated online text
data has
evolved into an important research area over the years.

•
Diversity of sources and opinions: Different online platforms are used for various pur-
poses,
which can be studied to address different
research questions.
For instance,
a
review website such as Amazon [4] or Yelp [5] would be used for the purpose of provid-
ing reviews on purchases of products or services, while a social network such as Twitter
[11] would be used for communicative purposes, and for general comments on everyday
topics, including socio-political ones [7]. The knowledge that is gained from this diverse
user-generated data is greatly useful
from several
perspectives - socio-politically,
and
also monetarily through viral marketing, recommendations and advertising.
In addition,
social networks have been shown to be fruitful in studying health and disease.
For in-
stance, Christakis and Fowler [12] have studied social factors that influence a seemingly
individual trait, such as smoking.
•
Data availability:
As mentioned before,
the rising popularity of online platforms has
3
PREVIEW
Introduction
Chapter 1
lead to a massive amount of content generation on a daily basis.
For instance,
as per
[13],
every minute,
Facebook users share about 2.5 million pieces of content,
Twitter
users tweet nearly 300,000 times, 200 million email messages are sent worldwide, and
so on.
A lot of this content is available for free for researchers to use, thereby making it
a rich domain for data-driven research.
•
Network interactions: For online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc., the
interactions between the users lead to interesting dynamics that has always been of great
interest amongst researchers [14, 15, 16].
•
Temporal dynamics: Since the content on these online platforms is being continuously
generated over time, it allows for the unfolding and analysis of temporal processes. Thus,
event detection, topic evolution and opinion dynamics can be studied using such data.
•
Need for Automation: The enormity of the data makes it infeasible for signal extraction
to be a manual process,
hence it needs to be automated.
Thus,
there is a need for the
development of methods to automatically extract information from online textual data.
1.2
Sources of Data
When conducting research on online social networks, it is important to be aware of the most
popularly used platforms since they would act as the richest sources of information, but ease
of data access also needs to be borne in mind. Here, I shall briefly discuss the most commonly
used platforms for user-generated data, and the data accessibility issues associated with each.
As per the statistics released by statista.com [17], as of April 2016, Facebook is the largest
online social network platform with over 1.5 billion active users.
Although research has been
conducted in the past using Facebook data [18, 19, 20], in general, owing to strict user privacy
settings, data access is very restricted.

Introduction
Chapter 1
Twitter, a popular microblogging tool, can be considered by far the most studied OSN [21].
The existence of a well-defined public interface for software developers to extract data from
the network [22],
the simplicity of its protocol,
and the public nature of most of its content
are some of the reasons why it has been widely studied.
However, since the beginning of the
service, rate policies have been created to control the amount of data allowed to be collected
by researchers and analysts. This has had a direct impact on research. While initial studies had
access to all the content published in the network, more recent studies are usually limited by
those policies [21].
It is also worth mentioning the existence of Chinese counterpart services for Facebook and
Twitter, like Sina-Weibo [23], the largest one, with more than 500 million registered users [24].
Although the usage of those services may differ due to cultural aspects [25, 26], similar lines
of inquiry can be developed in both the western and eastern equivalents [27, 28, 29].
Review websites such as Amazon [4],
Yelp [5],
etc.
host user reviews on products and
services and are rich sources of online content. Yelp [5] releases a portion of its data every year
for an academic challenge [30], containing user reviews on a number of businesses. Similarly,
portions of the Amazon [4] reviews are available from various academic research groups [31].
Other web services that integrate social networking features have been the focus of studies.
Examples are media sites like YouTube10 [32] and Flickr11 [33, 34], and news services such
as Digg12 [35, 36].
Research was also conducted over implicit social networks derived from
the Enron email dataset [37], university pages [38, 39] or blogs [40], even before the creation
of social networking services.

obtained by conducting surveys that can be expensive and time-consuming.
Further,
online
data provides us access to a large number of users and their self-generated content.
Thus, it is
a rich resource for analysing user behavior.
Chapter 2 of this thesis contains a detailed overview of some of the primary areas of re-
search in this area.
The research may be primarily divided into two groups: Social Data Anal-
ysis, in which the textual content is the focus of the study, and Social Interaction Analysis, in
which the user network is the primary object of study.
Our research focuses on Social Data
Analysis, with emphasis on user opinion mining and sentiment analysis, and user profiling.
In
particular, we conducted sentiment analysis on various datasets such as Twitter posts, Yelp and
Amazon reviews,
and on a number of topics such as U.S. Politics,
the Affordable Care Act,
Immigration Reforms in the U.S. on the Twitter front and restaurant and camera reviews from
Yelp and Amazon. Further, we analyze Twitter data to detect user ages by identifying topics of
conversation they engage in.
1.4
Challenges and Unresolved Areas
In spite of the large body of work in this domain, many of the primary challenges in work-
ing with online textual data have not been fully resolved.
Here,
we discuss a few of those
challenges.
•
Noise:
User-generated online text
data is inherently noisy in nature [41,
42].
Since
people tend to use informal language when expressing themselves online,
noise easily
creeps in and can make information extraction very difficult. Noise includes the presence
of misspellings, acronyms, slangs, case insensitivity, misplaced or multiple punctuation
marks, etc. to name a few. A few examples shall illustrate the point:
– Twitter: “Sometimes I snap at ppl on twitter bcuz im insecure.
its a defense mag-

nesium.”
– Twitter: “I wanna visit the ifold tower in france one day.”
– Facebook: “Illiturate people are making me sad.
How hard is it to actually spell
the words correctly???”
•
Ambiguity: When online surveys are conducted, participants are usually presented with
a set of questions to answer.
This results in a very structured format and makes signal
extraction easy.
However, online platforms do not possess such a structure, which often
results in the generation of ambiguous content from which it becomes hard to decipher
meaning. The following is an example of a camera review on Amazon:
Review:
“I recieved this camera a couple of days ago and I am very imprissed at the
ease of it and the sftware.
The quality of the pics are really stunning...I am looking like
a professional photographer alreaddy, and this is the first time I have picked up a real
camera since high school photography class...25 years ago...sigh; I have really checked
out the prices online and off, and this is a great buy! I dont know how you do it Amazon.
Keep bringing us the BARGAINS! Well, I am off to buy a compact flash memory card...ta
ta!” Rating: 3.0
On reading the review, it would seem like the user was very impressed with her purchase,
but the rating accompanying it does not reflect that.
•
Sparsity: Owing to the informal nature of the language used in online text data, there
are are many ways of expressing the same concept.
For instance, the word like may be
expressed in several other ways such as enjoy, admire, love, etc. In this case, considering
each word as a feature leads to high-dimensional, sparse data matrices.
•
Difficulty in signal
extraction:
OSNs are platforms where users can express their
generic likes and dislikes on a myriad of topics.
In such a scenario,
it is challenging
7
PREVIEW
Introduction
Chapter 1
to extract information pertaining to the research topic in question.
•
Absence of large-scale annotated datasets:
There is a lack of large-scale annotated
datasets in this area, which makes it hard to obtain ground truth with which to train and
verify models. This is a major problem in conducting research in this area.
•
Time:
There is an inherent temporal aspect to the data in this area,
since online posts
continue to be generated everyday.
Not many methods exist to capture and analyze this
temporal nature of conversation.
•
Generalizability: One of the primary problems in this area was the discovery that most
methods that analyze user behavior and sentiments are not generalisable.
From our own
experience, sentiment analysis methods that were previously developed did not perform
as expected when applied to our problem (Chapter 3.5.2). We have attempted to address
this issue by validating our proposed method on multiple datasets, for specific classes of
problems.
1.5
Scope and Outline of this Thesis
This thesis provides a general overview of the research questions that have been explored
in this domain in Chapter 2,
and then delves into the details of our own research projects.
Chapter 3 addresses the problem of opinion detection from Twitter data on specific topics, and
then proposes a solution.
It covers in detail the steps undertaken for the process, starting from
the data collection up until the model was formulated and verified.
In Chapter 4, we address
the concept of time with respect to online conversations on a topic and propose a solution on
detecting opinions in the face of an evolving conversation.
The method proposed has its roots
in seminal sociological models of the past. For both Chapters 3 and 4, Twitter [11] data is used
for conducting the experiments. Further, in Chapter 5, we explore the use of a review dataset for

performing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis.
The dataset, obtained from Yelp [5], contains
user reviews on businesses and services.
This work entails understanding user opinions but
with a deeper granularity. We propose a method to detect what users like and dislike about the
item under review and why, using distributed representation of words. Additional experiments
using the same method outlined in Chapter 5 are conducted on a digital camera review dataset
from Amazon, the results of which are presented in Appendix A. In Chapter 6, we address the
problem of identifying user age by analyzing their tweets. Using publicly available user tweets,
we propose a method that allows us to discover the various topics of conversation that users of
different age groups engage in, which in turn allows us to detect their age.
Finally, Chapter 7
provides a conclusion.

Survey and Related Work
This Chapter presents an overview of the existing work in this domain, from a computational
point of view. The research in this domain may be broadly categorised into two areas: research
that focuses on the textual content rather than the network,
and research that is more geared
towards the network and interactions amongst users.
The following sections will present an
overview of each of these areas and the research questions.
2.1
Social Data Analysis
Social Data Analysis focuses on the content that is generated by users. Working with noisy
online text requires extensive use of NLP techniques and machine learning.
In addition to the
challenge of building robust methods to solve the problems, scalability is a big issue owing to
the large amounts of social data that is available at the disposal of researchers.
2.1.1
Opinion Mining/Sentiment Analysis
Opinion mining and sentiment analysis focus on understanding user opinions and senti-
ments from online posts. This has been one of the most active areas of research in this domain.
