ABSTRACT 
Khan, Ishita K. Ph.D., Purdue University, December 2016. Protein Function, Diversity, 
and Functional Interplay. Major Professor: Daisuke Kihara. 
Functional annotations of novel or unknown proteins is one of the central prob-
lems in post-genomics bioinformatics research. With the vast expansion of genomic and 
proteomic data and technologies over the last decade, development of automated function 
prediction (AFP) methods for large-scale identification of protein function has become 
imperative in many aspects. In this research, we address two important divergences from 
the “one protein – one function” concept on which all existing AFP methods are devel-
oped: 
1. One protein with multiple independent functions – Moonlighting Proteins: 
Moonlighting proteins perform more than one independent cellular function within one 
polypeptide chain. Recent biological experiments have been discovering such multi-
functional proteins at a steady pace. Our work on moonlighting proteins can be divided 
into two logical parts: 
1a.
Development of a computational framework for comprehensive 
genome-scale characterization of moonlighting proteins based on functional and context-
based information. Our work identifies characteristic features of moonlighting proteins in 
both cases where current databases have functional annotations of the diverse functions 
of such proteins and cases where functional annotations do not exist. 
1b.
Development of

automated prediction models of moonlighting proteins. We take two different approaches 
for our model development: using functional and context based features in a machine 
learning framework, and using text-based features, learned through text-mining algo-
rithms. 
2. Group of proteins sharing a common function: On a regular basis, biological 
experiments reveal sets of proteins involved in disease/disorder/cellular phenomena 
without sufficient explanation of the functional mechanisms of these group activities. In-
tuitively, proteins interact in a cell physically, through gene expression or genetic interac-
tion to perform a common function that so often ends up causing a disease/disorder. To 
understand the functional nature of a set of proteins, it is often important to understand 
the functionalities in which they are involved in as a group, rather than understanding the 
detailed functional characteristics of the individual proteins. In this research, we develop 
a conditional random field (CRF)-based framework that predicts the function of the “pro-
tein groups”, based on group neighborhood of their interaction network, and iteratively 
updates the function annotation of the unknown group members such that it reflects the 
protein’s group activity. 
For the protein function prediction research domain, it is vital to keep pace with 
existing AFP methods by improving the prediction accuracy, updating the models and 
making the methods available to the bioinformatics community. The final part of this re-
search copes with the AFP problem in three aspects: improvement, database update and 
web-server development of two existing methods: PFP and ESG, and participation in a 
community-wide challenge for the AFP methods called CAFA (Critical Assessment of 
Function Annotation) and benchmarking the performances.

CHAPTER 1.
INTRODUCTION 
1.1
Background 
Elucidating 
the 
biological 
function 
of 
proteins 
is 
vital 
to 
understanding 
the 
molecular mechanism of life, hence stands as a fundamental problem in diverse branches 
of biology and bioinformatics.
As the amount of protein sequence and interaction data 
grows at an exponential rate, performing biological experiments to find functions of all 
the 
genes 
becomes 
an 
insurmountable 
task. 
At 
one 
end, 
large-scale 
experimental 
approaches give only non-specific information about the function of the protein, whereas 
in the other end small-scale experiments provide more direct evidence but are costly and 
labor intensive. Figure 1.1 shows the growth of sequence and structure databases well-
known in bioinformatics research domain. Striking growth of databases such as GenBank 
[1] and KEGG [2] is evident from the plot, as number of DNA sequences rise from ~10
3
to ~10
8 
in GenBank between years 1983-2014, and number of gene entries rise from 
10
5
~10
7
within years 1998-2016 in the KEGG database. 
Consequently, bioinformatics approaches have been long sought as solutions that 
bridge the gap between the pace of whole-genome sequencing and revealing functional 
insights for the newly sequenced genes. Computational function prediction methods are 
also useful for analyzing protein function on a proteomic scale, such as interpreting high-
throughput 
experiments 
including 
gene 
expression 
and 
protein-protein 
interaction

data, since these methods can be applied to a large number of proteins in a short time. As 
sequencing the whole genome of organisms becomes routine in experimental laboratories 
due to the rapid advancement of sequencing technologies, computational gene function 
prediction methods have become increasingly important.

Yearly release information of KEGG data was obtained from GenomeNet 
(http://www.kanehisa.jp/en/db_growth.html) 
1.2
Protein function prediction methods 
The history of computational protein function prediction goes back to a very early 
stage of bioinformatics, when algorithms of sequence alignments and sequence database 
searches covered the major research problems in this area
. 
From an evolutionary point of 
view, genes evolved from the same ancestor commonly retain sequence and functional 
similarity. Since protein sequence determines the tertiary structure of the protein, conven-
tionally researchers have used protein sequence or structural similarity to transfer func-
PREVIEW

tion information between proteins. Since structure-based methods rely on the availability 
of known structures of proteins, data that is quite scarce in the enormous genomic land-
scape, more often than not, the only available information on a functionally un-annotated 
protein is its sequence. Conventional homology-based function prediction methods can 
be summarized into three main categories: sequence-to-sequence comparison methods 
such as SSSEARCH [3], FASTA[4] and BLAST [5] extract functional annotations from 
top hit sequences which have a significant similarity score with the query. The second 
category of homology-based methods are profile-to-sequence comparison method such as 
PSI-BLAST[6], that iteratively construct a profile (multiple sequence alignment, MSA) 
with a target and retrieved sequences and uses it for the search in next iteration. Profiles 
can also be pre-computed for sequences in a database, and a target sequence is matched 
against them. This approach formulates the third category of sequence-based function 
annotation methods – sequence-to-profile comparison methods such as and BLOCKS [7], 
ProDom [8], PRINTS [9], Pfam [10] and InterPro [11]. 
Aside from the conventional homology-based function prediction methods, several 
advanced methods were developed that extract function information thoroughly from se-
quence database search results by making use of sequence-based features. Some of these 
methods have used machine learning tools such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) or 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as the backbone of their function prediction scheme. 
These methods include PFP [12,13], ESG [14], GOtcha [15], GOPET [16], OntoBlast 
[17], GOFigure [18], and ConFunc [19]. 
The homology driven function annotation methods have some shortcomings. There 
are cases where sequence similarity does not directly imply functional similarity (e.g. 
PREVIEW
4 
4 
gene duplication/paralogous genes). Also, homology driven annotation transfer leads to 
the percolation of miss-annotations in databases. Moreover, sequence data do not provide 
information on the biological context of protein functions. Such context driven function 
prediction can be performed using large-scale data on interactions (e.g. physical, genetic, 
co-expression) which are commonly represented as networks, with nodes representing 
proteins and edges representing the detected interactions. 
Network based approaches were classified into two categories in a review by Sharan 
et. al. [41]: direct methods predict the functions of a protein from the known functions of 
its neighbors/interacting protein in the network. Module-based/indirect methods first 
identify function modules in the network and subsequently assign enriched function in 
the module to their un-annotated components. On the other hand, SIFTER [20], Flower-
Power [21], and Orthostrapper [22] employ phylogenetic trees to transfer functions to 
target genes in the evolutionary context.
There are other function prediction methods 
considering co-expression patterns of genes [23-27], 3D structures of proteins [28-36] as 
well as interacting proteins in large-scale protein-protein interaction networks [37-42]. 
1.3
Vocabulary for function prediction 
For managing computational protein function prediction there is a need to trans-
form the descriptive biological knowledge into a controlled and well-defined vocabulary. 
The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium [43] of collaborating databases has developed a 
structured controlled vocabulary to describe gene function and currently serves as the 
dominant approach for machine-legible functional annotation. GO describes three aspects 
of gene product function: 
molecular function
, 
biological process
and 
cellular location
. 
PREVIEW
5 
5 
Biological process (BP) terms indicate pathways and larger processes made up of the ac-
tivities of multiple gene products. Examples of biological processes are 
carbohydrate me-
tabolism (GO:0003677)
, 
regulation of transcription (GO:0045449)
. Molecular functions 
(MF) represent activities carried out at molecular level by proteins or complexes, for ex-
ample, 
catalytic activity (GO:0003824)
or 
DNA binding (GO:0003677)
. Cellular compo-
nent (CC) indicates to which anatomical part of the cell the protein belongs to, for exam-
ple, 
ribosome (GO:0005840)
or 
nucleus (GO:0005634)
. Thus each GO term has a cate-
gory and an identifier in the format GO:xxxxxxx associated with it, along with a term 
definition to explain the meaning of the term. Each of the BP, MF and CC ontology is 
represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where terms are represented as nodes in 
the graph and are arranged from general to specific. By standardizing an annotation and 
defining the relationships between terms using a graph, annotations may be computation-
ally processed. 
1.4
One protein multiple functions ─ Moonlighting protein 
Automated protein function prediction methods are based on the concept of one pro-
tein involved in one function; hence conventionally AFP methods are based on sequence 
or structure homology. As the major focus of my research, I address two possible diver-
gences from the “one protein – one function” concept for the first time that has inevitable 
impact on cellular processes: the first is the aspect of one protein having multiple func-
tions, or moonlighting proteins, and the next is the aspect of group of proteins performing 
one function, described in the next subsection.

As the number of functionally characterized proteins increases, it has been ob-
served that there are proteins involved in more than one function [44-46]. These proteins 
were described as “moonlighting” proteins [44]. Moonlighting proteins (MP) perform 
more than one independent cellular function within one polypeptide chain. Recent biolog-
ical experiments have been discovering such multi-functional proteins at a steady pace. 
However, existing computational methods for automated function prediction (AFP) prob-
lem are aimed at identifying one, not multiple function of proteins; hence development of 
bioinformatics approaches for automatic identification of MPs has inevitable impact and 
novelty. Our work on moonlighting proteins can be divided into three logical parts: 
1a. [47-49]: Development of a computational framework for comprehensive ge-
nome-scale characterization of moonlighting proteins based on functional and context-
based information. Based on current knowledge of experimentally identified MPs, our 
work identifies characteristic features of MPs in both cases where current databases have 
functional annotations of the diverse functions of such proteins and cases when functional 
annotations do not exist. Different context-based protein association are explored for 
characterizing MPs apart from direct GO based results, such as protein-protein interaction 
(PPI), phylogenetic profile association, gene expression profile correlation, genetic inter-
action, protein’s structural features etc. 
1b. [50]: Development of an automated prediction model of moonlighting pro-
teins based on functional and context based features established in 1a. Our model applies 
machine learning classifiers to perform MP prediction on the diverse feature space. The 
model also addresses the missing feature problem commonly found in interaction net-
works, and imputes the features missing in protein databases through a iterative learning
