BSTRACT
Every year, hundreds of communities in the United States suffer the casualties, 
damages, and disruptions inflicted by extreme events. Recoveries may span from months 
to years, with some community recovery projects planned yet never implemented. 
Adapting to climate change is an urgent societal issue. The private and public sectors 
within the United States have embraced adaptation planning and building resilient 
communities as necessary to minimize these damages. In response, substantial climate 
change adaptation planning is occurring at all levels of the government and in local 
communities, yet implementation of these plans varies significantly and understanding 
how they contribute to reduced fiscal exposure also varies. Many local climate 
adaptation plans identify the need for federal partners, but few identify with which 
federal agencies to partner or how to prioritize plans to implement. Substantial research 
on how to define resilience is occurring, yet the existing literature has not yet converged 
on a definition. This leads to the predicament that the current techniques used to analyze 
climate adaptation and community resilience are not reaching their full potential and 
climate vulnerabilities might not be reduced as anticipated. The academic literature 
indicates there does not yet exist a framework to analytically test whether municipalities 
contains similar structures, which attributes or components are necessary and sufficient, 
and how feedbacks between the components lead to the properties identified as important 
in climate adaptation and resilience. Without a framework of this type, decision support 
tools cannot effectively identify the leverage points to close the implementation gap. 
This thesis aims to bridge this gap by identifying the critical success components and an

operational strategy for community resilience and climate adaptation planning that 
reduces the federal fiscal exposure to climate change. The results indicate that there are 
critical components common to most communities to implement climate adaptation 
actions, there is a plausible systems framework for posing the problem, and a decision 
tool has been developed that will be useful to communities seeking federal resources for 
implementation adaptation plans.

CKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This work was made possible by the support from exceptional mentors, peers, 
friends, family, animals, bikes, and skis who have support me over the last four years. 
My advisor, Mary Albert, introduced me to this research topic in her Climate Change and 
Engineering class. In Mary’s class, Dr. Kate White gave a seminar about the work the 
Army Corps was doing to enhance community resilience. After my first two years at 
Thayer studying sea ice and snow albedo in the Arctic, Dr. White’s seminar helped me 
find a pathway to combine my passion for physics and climate (particularly cold 
mountainous regions) with my interest in societal issues related to climate change. I am 
eternally grateful that Mary was excited to mentor me in this new field of climate 
adaptation. I am thankful she encouraged me to reach out to Dr. White and that Dr. 
White was excited to work with us on this thesis project. Over the past two years, Mary’s 
mentorship and high standards have shaped me into the scientist I am today. 
I would like to thank my committee members for their thoughtful guidance and 
feedback on this work. I would especially like to recognize Dr. White’s positive 
encouragement to frame problems as opportunities for improvement, Erich Osterberg’s 
interest in applying this work to improve climate resiliency in the Upper Valley, and 
Vikrant Vaze’s deep expertise and enthusiasm for modeling complex systems. 
Thank you to my mentors from across campus and CRREL. Especially to Steve 
Peterson, for his willingness to advise a last minute independent study on System 
Dynamics and his continued friendship and support since then, Melody Burkins and Dean 
Helble for guiding my development in science policy and diplomacy, Carl Thume for his

NTRODUCTION
American communities and the federal government face growing exposure from 
extreme weather events. In response to this urgent societal issue [1-4], climate change 
adaptation planning and building resilient communities have become important in policy 
strategies [5-9] and academic research [10-13]. The overall status of climate adaptation 
from the literature is that although climate adaptation planning is occurring at all levels of 
the government (e.g. [7]), private sector (e.g. [14]), and community level (e.g. [15, 16]), 
implementation of climate policies has been limited [3, 17-19] and many Americans are 
still vulnerable and not effectively prepared for climate change impacts [7, 8, 10, 20-28]. 
This leads some academics to the conclusion that the current adaptation and resilient 
community focused planning efforts have thus far provided limited operational advice to 
secure improved outcomes [4, 29]. To address this broad issue of how to effectively 
prepare American communities for the changing climate, recent academic literature 
suggests focusing back to the technical systems origin of the climate adaptation and 
resilience literature [12, 19]. 
Social constructs such as communities, cities, and the government are composed 
of built, natural, social, and economic environments that influence each other in dynamic 
and evolving ways [12]. As such, they have been proposed as analogous to complex 
natural or technical systems [12, 30]. Applying natural and technical systems thinking to 
social constructs is compelling [1, 12, 31]. However, in natural or technical systems, the 
system is often definable with a recognized set of structural components, has a proven 
solution, and its properties and behaviors can be mathematically derived based on the 
PREVIEW
2 
laws of physics. But in social systems, the system is often difficult to define and people 
have different points of views and no single solution is complete. Furthermore, the 
climate literature has yet not reached consensus on the critical common components [12, 
32], their properties, relationships [33], or resulting behaviors that allow for climate 
adaptation processes to occur [19], why barriers to climate implementation arise [34], and 
generally agree that no one solution fits all problems [1, 22, 29, 35]. The analogy breaks 
down here because there are not clearly defined building blocks to analyze the function, 
structural components, relationships, and resulting behaviors of social systems. 
Reflecting this, the adaptation and resilient community planning approaches have been 
largely focused on defining the attributes or components of a resilient community or 
successful climate policy adoption. 
The existing climate adaptation research generally provides static metrics in time, 
space, and scale [36-38]; most lack a framework for incorporating feedbacks or tools to 
assess the dynamic nature of a community [18]. There does not yet exist a framework to 
test whether many municipalities contains a similar structure, which attributes or 
components are necessary and sufficient [18], and how feedbacks between the 
components lead to the properties identified as important in climate adaptation and 
resilience [18, 19]. This makes it even more difficult to identify leverage points to begin 
to close the climate implementation gap and reduce vulnerabilities to the changing 
climate. 
This leads to three main questions that exist in the literature: 1) what are the 
critical components of the community system that work together as a system to 
implement climate adaptation actions and reduce the federal fiscal exposure to climate

change; 2) is there a systems framework that could be used to examine relationships and 
feedbacks between components; 3) can we build a decision support tool that can be used 
by communities to locate federal financial resources to use for implementation of climate 
adaptation plans? 
The contributions of this thesis are three-fold: 1) to identify the common structure 
and the causal relationships that lead to successful climate adaptation; 2) to propose a 
systems framework for community adaptation planning and implementation; and 3) build 
a decision support tool that can identify resources from federal agencies that would be 
appropriate for implementing community climate adaptation plans. This research uses a 
novel approach of applying technical and quantitative tools to qualitative requirements. 
Chapter Two provides a brief overview and background of the field of climate 
adaptation, community resilience, policy adoption theories, and the proposed structure of 
the dynamic climate adaptation process. The breadth of literature and experience that 
contribute to the understanding of climate adaptation is large. The contributing fields 
span a range from physics and engineering to psychological resilience to the 
fundamentals of policy adoption to using quantitative tools to understand qualitative 
processes. Chapter Three provides a brief overview of the techniques used in this thesis 
for translating qualitative concepts into analytical models. 
techniques used in this thesis for translating qualitative concepts into analytical models. 
Chapter Four uses case studies as evidence to identify the critical success 
components of a community that work together as a system to generate successful 
climate adaptation actions. From this, we propose an operation strategy that builds on 
PREVIEW
4 
concepts from systems engineering. We identify the added value of this system is 
evident in reduced planning-to-implementation time, which enhances the capability for 
projects to succeed thus reducing the community’s vulnerability to climate change. 
Reducing the community’s vulnerability to climate change can help reduce the federal 
fiscal exposure to future climate change. 
Chapter Five constructs a novel quantitative system dynamic model to study 
elements of community involvement in climate adaptation. This model is used to explore 
the dynamics of community resilience. The results demonstrate the proposed simplified 
community system framework can, in fact, describes the general community adaptation 
implementation behavior observed in the literature. This has not yet been demonstrated 
in the literature. 
Chapter Six develops a decision support tool that uses natural language 
processing to match community climate adaptation plans with federal agency strategic 
plans in order to identify potential sources of federal fiscal resources that would be 
appropriate for the community. The analysis technique can also identify latent 
connections between federal agencies that can be used by federal agencies to partner in 
leveraging resources. This research is novel as it provides a quantitative metric to 
describe latent qualitative and it results in a decision support tool that will be directly 
useful to the sponsor, USACE.

URRENT UNDERSTANDING OF COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND CLIMATE 
ADAPTATION PROCESSES 
To identify how the system works, the author examines the literature for identified 
states, the key structural elements that lead to persistent behaviors, feedbacks between the 
structural elements, and any modeling that has been done to turn the qualitative concepts 
into quantitative analysis. There are three dominant approaches identified in the climate 
literature, each is explained as both a behavior and a set of attributes – which includes 
stocks and flows. These are: 1) define the persistent barriers in order to overcome them 
(i.e. [19]); 2) define the resilient attributes of a community in order to plan for them (i.e. 
[39]); and 3) define the key components to policy adoption and implementation in order 
to pass and implement climate policy (i.e. [18]). Equally important, but less dominant is 
the importance of integrating human behavior into the climate adaptation process. This 
literature draws from diverse fields such as psychology, behavioral economics, 
community-engagement, health, learning, social networks, political science, engineering, 
natural hazards, mathematics and ecology and uses mostly theory and case studies to 
draw conclusions. The purpose of this section is to briefly recognize the status of these 
four approaches (barriers, resilience, governance, and human behavior) with respect to 
the behaviors identified, consensus on attributes, and any modeling that has occurred to 
represent these system concepts.

Ample research exists on climate adaptation barriers [4, 19, 34, 40-43]. The most 
common barriers include people (i.e. values, beliefs, leadership), resources (i.e. fiscal and 
technical), and communication of information [34, 41]. Barrier thinking generally 
involves a laundry list of different barriers identified from case studies, surveys, or the 
literature. For example, Bierbaum, Smith [41] review the literature and present 
adaptation barriers by category. Moser and Ekstrom [34] consolidates these barriers into 
barriers at each of the three phases of the climate adaptation process (identifying, 
planning, and implementing/monitoring). Burch [42] and Barnett, Graham [44] take a 
different approach and, based on case studies, identify attributes can transform barriers 
into enablers of action. Eisenack, Moser [19] argue that there is a need to first define the 
word “barrier” then identify the feedbacks that lead to persistent barriers in order to 
advance climate adaptation planning [19]. As far as the author has found, barriers have 
all been defined qualitatively and the persistent behavior has yet to be modeled. There is 
an opportunity to view the persistent barrier behavior as resulting from some relationship 
between stocks (i.e. people and resources) and flows (i.e. information transfer). 
Instead of defining barriers, another dominant perspective is to identify the 
attributes of a resilient community that are necessary to both prepare and respond for 
climate change [10-12, 31, 33, 38, 39, 45-51]. Resilience, by definition, is a reactive 
behavior, not a set of pro-active attributes (see definition above). This lends itself to a 
well-discussed dichotomy in the literature [12], but despite this, it is still used as the 
dominant buzzword. By identifying resilient elements and attributes, the literature aims 
to pro-actively enhance these elements to lead to better outcomes. Many of the listed 
terms may include more than one attribute, have more than one meaning, or be a process.

For example, Abramson, Grattan [52] propose the term “capital” can include human, 
social, economic, and political capital. But Cimellaro, Renschler [37] use the term to 
mean social-cultural capital. Maclean, Cuthill [46] identify community networks as a key 
attribute, but they define this as the process of gaining social capital by supporting local 
leaders and volunteers to facilitate building effective community networks. Regardless, 
here is a list of six common attributes/processes of social resilience: knowledge, skills 
and learning; community networks to support local leaders (social capital); people-place 
connections; community infrastructure (human capital); a diverse and innovative 
economy (economic capital); and engaged governance (political capital) [37, 46, 53]. 
Similar to barriers thinking, the field struggles to reach a consensus on defining the 
concepts [12, 32, 33, 53], its key structural elements [12, 32], how they influence each 
other to generate the behavior of interest [33], what that behavior of interest is [33], and 
making these qualitative concepts quantitative [10, 36-38] and dynamic. 
Despite these challenge, Cutter, Barnes [38] built a Social Vulnerability Index 
(SoVI) of the United States based on census and geography data. This is a great start to 
risk and vulnerability discussions, as it takes the qualitative concept of social 
vulnerability and provides it with a quantitative metric. Using SoVI as a metric for 
resilience is limited because it is a static variable not a dynamic behavior. Similarly, 
Cimellaro, Renschler [37] provide a mathematical framework for measuring resilience at 
different spatial and temporal scales based on seven dimensions: population; 
environment; organized government services; physical infrastructure; lifestyle and 
community competence; economic development; and social-cultural capital. Although 
they aim to be comprehensive, their model does not include concepts of social networks,

knowledge, learning, or feedbacks between the different components over time. These 
are all attributes and processes that contribute to the dynamic and evolving nature of the 
system’s resilient behavior pre and post impact. Without them, the model’s usefulness is 
limited. 
Finally, the academic literature has reached a consensus that human behavior is 
integral to not only driving changes in global climate, but to responding and adapting to 
it. Integrating psychological research is critical to all climate decision-making processes 
[38, 54-56]. Mental models are individually held cognitions that lead to the beliefs and 
values through which individuals interpret, filter, and interact with the external world 
[56]. Mental models enable individuals to make decisions given their internal set of 
information, and to allow different scenarios to be examined [54]. Change in mental 
models is considered a type of learning [54]. Mental models can change through social 
interactions between stakeholders within a given social network [54, 57, 58]. Models for 
learning exist, but these have not yet been incorporated into climate adaptation. Decision 
making models aim to incorporate mental models through stakeholder involvement. 
To summarize, there are three dominant approaches to understand climate 
adaptation: barriers, resilience, and governance. Less dominant, but equally important is 
integrating human behavior research into the climate adaptation process. These 
approaches indicate the literature has veered away from identifying how the system 
works towards defining the symptoms of a successful (or unsuccessful system) – i.e. the 
resilient properties, adaptation barriers, and policy enablers. This is slightly puzzling as 
the foundation of communities and governance is derived from physics, math, and 
systems engineering [12, 32]. Results of this attribute-focused static approach have led

to minimal implementation over time. Instead, a dynamic systems approach with well-
defined tools can be applied to advance the understanding of the implementation barrier. 
Thus far, it has been difficult to define how the system works because the climate 
literature does a poor job of separating and defining things that accumulate or drain (i.e. 
stocks) from things that flow (i.e. flows), relationships between stocks and flows, and/or 
expected behaviors over time.

VERVIEW OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION POLICY ADOPTION THEORY 
The literature on climate adaptation policy adoption in US municipalities also 
contains both barriers [4, 42, 59] and attributes for success [17, 42, 60]. Unlike barrier 
and resilient attribute thinking, governance literature focuses the conversation on the 
processes of adaptation planning and implementation. [4, 18] find three common critical 
conditions for explaining implementation of urban climate policy include: the capacity of 
municipal governments; the way climate policies are linked to local issues; and the role 
of local political actors and factors. When these conditions are met, the municipality has 
the components to implement successful policy decisions. If one or more of these 
qualitative conditions are not met, the system will not succeed. For example, even when 
government capacity exists, implementation of policy can be blocked or delayed by 
resisting actors [4, 18]. Despite the dynamic recognition in the literature, modeling 
climate policy innovation and adoption remains largely explained by static statistical 
analyses.

Policy adoption theories 
The field of policy adoption has two general theories: internal determinants model 
and policy diffusion theory [61-64]. The internal determinants model explains policy 
adoption as a function of key state attributes such as economic and political 
characteristics [60-64] in addition to demographics and geography [60]. This model is 
generally tested through a cross-sectional approach and has been supported by 
considerable empirical evidence. 
Within the internal determinants model, there exist several strategies for isolating 
the characteristics that lead to policy adoption. The dependent variable is either a 
measure of how early a state adopts a policy among a group of potential adopters or 
whether a given state has adopted a policy. The major issue with this approach is that 
policies are adopted over long periods of time. This causes some policies to be removed 
from the measurement year of the independent variables, which can lead to problematic 
results [61]. 
Policy diffusion research focuses on regional diffusion of state policies. It 
observes that a given state is more likely to adopt a policy innovation when other 
neighboring states have already implemented it [60-64]. This model is generally tested 
using an event history analysis and has also been supported by considerable empirical 
evidence [61]. 
Rashidi and Patt [60] offer two dominant horizontal diffusion pathways: attending 
a conference and being a member of a transnational climate network such as ICLEI and 
C40. At regional conferences, policy makers have more frequent contact with 
neighboring states at regional conferences, than those further away [61]. Whereas
