Abstract
Online social media and games are increasingly replacing offline social
activities.
Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication;
online gaming is not only a genuine social
activity but also a popular
spectator sport.
With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online
interaction shrinks social
and geographical
barriers.
Despite such ben-
efits,
social
disparities such as gender inequality persist in online social
media.
In particular, online gaming communities have been criticized for
persistent gender disparities and objectification.
As gaming evolves into
a social
platform,
persistence of
gender disparity is a pressing question.
Yet, there are few large-scale, systematic studies of gender inequality and
objectification in social gaming platforms.
Here we analyze more than one
billion chat messages from Twitch,
a social
game-streaming platform,
to
study how the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conver-
sation.
Using a combination of computational text analysis methods, we
show that gendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats.
Female streamers receive significantly more objectifying comments while
male streamers receive more game-related comments.
This difference is
more pronounced for popular streamers.
There also exists a large number
of
users who post only on female or male streams.
Employing a neural
vector-space embedding (paragraph vector) method, we analyze gendered
chat messages and create prediction models that (i) identify the gender
of
streamers based on messages posted in the channel
and (ii) identify
the gender a viewer prefers to watch based on their chat messages.
Our
findings suggest that disparities in social
game-streaming platforms is a
nuanced phenomenon that involves the gender of
streamers as well
as
those who produce gendered and game-related conversation.

Introduction
Simone de Beauvoir said,
“One is not born a woman,
but becomes one” [1],
highlighting the situation of women as not free to make decisions about their
life,
but rather shackled by a society that objectifies them,
severely limiting
their actions and opportunities.
Since Beauvoir’s clarion call,
researchers have
examined the extent to which women continue to be objectified in popular
media such as television,
movies,
and advertisements [2].
Such media continue
to reinforce women as objects under the “gaze” of men [3].
The Internet and the Web enable complex forms of
many-to-many social
interaction and make one’s identity less conspicuous.
On first glance,
they
provide an ostensibly “gender-neutral” medium,
offering new opportunities to
empower women.
However,
studies suggest that inequality remains in online
spaces.
For instance, in the popular microblogging platform Twitter, the “glass-
ceiling” effect [4]
and gender-biased user dialogue [5,
6]
are observed.
Studies
on image search engines [7] and Wikipedia [8, 9, 10] also demonstrate persistent
gender stereotypes and disparities.
While data-driven research on online gender inequality has focused on several
popular online platforms,
online gaming has received little attention,
although
the advent of the Internet and of social media has transformed video games into
genuine social activities [11]. Video games are no longer the purview of arcades
and family rooms; they are social activities connecting people across the world,
and a widely broadcasted and watched medium.
Numerous online communities
are devoted to discussing,
watching,
and playing video games.
Traditionally
considered a “boy’s activity” [12,
13],
the culture of
gaming communities has
been accused of misogyny [14]. Videos games themselves can be a medium that
glorifies the objectification of women [15, 16, 17]. The online space of video games
provides no respite from these inequities;
ethnographic studies have observed
that,
when female gamers have revealed their identities online,
gamers cease
speaking about game-related topics and instead shift to the gamer herself and
her gender [13, 18].
Yet,
little work has systematically examined,
on a large scale,
the possibly
gendered nature of the next evolution of social media and online video gaming:
social video game-streaming platforms.
On the most popular of these platforms,
Twitch,
gamers can stream their gameplay and communicate with viewers in
real-time.
To give an idea of
its popularity,
in 2015,
Twitch had a monthly
average of 1.7 million broadcasters and half a million concurrent viewers [19].
The 2013 world championship of “League of Legends”, a popular online game,
was broadcast live on Twitch; the event was watched by more people than the
NBA finals [20].
An interesting aspect of Twitch is that the success of e-sports has allowed
some video game professionals and personalities to garner a cult following ri-
valing those of many celebrities.
Central to the success of these individuals are
their channels.
In Twitch,
each game stream is called a “channel” and is run
by an individual streamer, a group of streamers, an organization, or a channel
aggregator.
Browsing the list of public channels,
one can not only find a wide

variety of
games — League of
Legends,
Counter Strike,
and Hearthstone [19,
21]
— but creative performance arts such as painting,
music,
and animation
making.
Many streamers play,
in addition to their main game,
other games in
their channels.
Twitch facilitates communication between viewers and the streamers by pro-
viding a public chat room for each channel.
Viewers can post chat messages to
communicate with the streamers or with other viewers.
Streamers can also post
in the chat, but often streamers just share their webcam feed and talk directly
in the stream.
Importantly, the relationship between viewers and streamers is a
potential source of income in Twitch;
streamers earn revenue by holding game
events, having subscribers, and encouraging donations.
Fig. 1 shows the inter-
face of Twitch which has a game feed, streamer’s webcam feed, and public chat
room.
In sum, Twitch represents one of the most popular platforms for the rapidly
rising form of
social
gaming.
In Twitch,
the spectacle of
gaming is not only
watching the video game and streamers but also the actions of
the viewers
themselves [22]. With this fundamental transformation in gaming culture, where
viewers and streamers both have the power to communicate and to be seen, our
study investigate how gender inequality manifests in the Twitch platform, asking
the following research questions:
• Are chat messages addressed to streamers gendered?
Is there a relation-
ship between the gender of
a streamer and the nature of
messages that
the streamer receives?
For instance,
do female streamers receive more
objectifying comments,
while male streamers receive more game-related
messages? Is it possible to classify the gender of a channel’s streamer by
the comments they receive?
• Are viewers and their messages gendered?
Do viewers choose channels
based on gender? Is the gendered choice of channels correlated with ob-
jectifying language?
3
Our analysis on whether social game-streaming platforms exhibit gendered be-
havior is timely.
These platforms have become a powerful and influential medium
for new and young gamers alike, and this influence may have far-reaching con-
sequences outside the domain of social media, for example by distorting beliefs
about women in the real world [23].

Data and Methods
2.1
Data and Terminology
Our data comprises of all chat messages posted in public Twitch chat rooms be-
tween August 26th and November 10th in 2014 (76 days).
There were 1,275,396,751
messages posted in 927,247 channels (1,375 messages per channel
on average),
by 6,716,014 viewers (190 messages per user on average).
For each message the
following information is available:
timestamp,
author,
channel,
and message
text.
Author and channel are identified by screen name; for the channel, this is
the screen name of the streamer.
Similar to other social media, the activity and popularity of Twitch channels
are highly skewed.
We can quantify them by counting the number of messages
produced by each user and channel (for activity), as well as the number of users
chatting in a channel
(for popularity).
Fig.
2 shows the distributions of these
variables.
Our analysis is based on the subset of
71,154,340 messages posted to the
chats of a matched sample of 200 female and 200 male streamers.
To estimate
the gender of streamers we manually examined the webcam feeds from archived
video feeds of
past streams.
We started by ranking all
channels by the total
number of chat messages and examined the streamers of the most active 1,000
channels.
We discarded those streamers who do not share their webcam in their
streams.
From this initial procedure we found 102 female streamers.
From this
group, we discarded three streamers whose profile information was not written
in English,
leaving 99 English-speaking female streamers from the top 1,000
streamers.
We then applied the same procedure to a random sample of
less
popular streamers, i.e. whose channels ranked between 1, 000 and 16, 000 in the
chat activity distribution, and found the remaining 101 female streamers.
Having found a sample of
female streamers,
we identify a matched sam-
ple of male streamers.
The reason for matching samples is that prior work on
these data has shown that the nature of conversations on Twitch depends dra-
matically on chat activity [24]. In particular, as the rate of messages increases,
messages become shorter and contain more emoticons.
Because male streamers
tend to be on average more popular than female ones, and since more popular

channels will inevitably have a higher rate of chat activity, statistical estimates
of language difference may be biased.
To control for this potential source of bias
we thus match male and female streamers by stratifying on the channel activity
distribution [25].
Because male streamers outnumber female ones, we sampled male streamers
who matched the 200 female streamers identified before.
We used the number
of
chat messages as the matching criteria;
that is,
every male streamer has
a matching counterpart in the female streamers sample with respect to the
channel activity, and not to the rank.
As we did for the identification of female
streamers, the gender of male streamers was manually identified and only those
who used English in their profile were kept.
For the remainder of this paper we
refer to the top 100 channels in each gender as popular channels and the rest as
less popular channels.
2.2
Statistically Overrepresented Words
As our first exploratory analysis, we detect unigrams and bigrams that are over-
represented in either male or female streamers.
To do so, we use log-odds ratios
with informative Dirichlet prior method [26]. The method estimates the log-odds
5
ratio of each word w between two corpora i
and j
given the prior frequencies
obtained from a background corpus α.
The log-odds ratio for word w,
δ
(i-j)
w
is
estimated as

w
(resp.

w
) is the count
of word w in corpus i (resp.

is size of the background corpus, and α

is
the frequency of word w in the background corpus.
Furthermore,
this method provides an estimate for the variance of the log-
odds ratio,

and thus a z-score:

(3)
By leveraging the informative prior obtained from the background corpus, this
method often outperforms other methods such as PMI (point-wise mutual infor-
mation) or TF-IDF, particularly in detecting significant differences of frequent
words without over-emphasizing fluctuations of rare words [26, 27].
2.3
Word and Document Embeddings
To characterize individual
users and channels we create a document for each
channel
(and user) by aggregating every chat message in the channel
(by the
user).
Then we jointly obtain vector-space representations of words, users, and
channels by using the paragraph vector (doc2vec) method [28], which is an ex-
tension of the popular word2vec embedding method [29]. This joint embedding
not only allows us to do vector operations across documents and words, but has
been argued to outperform other document embedding methods in document
similarity comparison tasks [30]. We use the skip-gram with negative sampling
(SGNS) model to learn word vectors.
Among two main doc2vec models — dis-
tributed memory (DM) and distributed bag of words (DBOW) — here we use
the DBOW model because of its conceptual simplicity, efficiency, and reported
superiority in performance [30]. We use the doc2vec implementation available in
popular gensim Python library [31]. The dimension of vectors is set to 100 and
the window (skip-gram) size is set to 5.
The model
is trained with 10 epochs.

Results
3.1
Exploratory Language Analysis
We perform a term-based exploratory analysis to identify gendered terms.
We
group channels based on their popularity (i.e.,
popular vs.
less popular) and
gender,
producing four “documents”:
‘popular male’,
‘popular female’,
‘less
popular male’, and ‘less popular female’.
To remove channel-specific terms, we
keep only words that are used in at least 100 channels, 20 female channels, and
20 male channels.
We make two comparisons:
popular female vs. popular male
and less popular female vs. less popular male.
We compute log-odds ratio (see
§ 2.2) for unigrams and bigrams by using the word frequency in the entire Twitch
dataset as the prior.
The terms are ranked by their estimated z-scores and the 25
terms with the largest absolute z-score values are selected and visualized.
The z-
scores of the displayed words range from 175 to 17.
The identified words are then
manually categorized into four categories — streamer ids, game-related jargon,
objectifying cues,
and miscellaneous — by using the information available in
Twitch and other online forums.
By objectifying cues, we mean language that
reduce women to their body or appearance [32]
or as objects to be owned or
used [33].
Popular channels display a clear contrast between two genders (Fig 3, left).
Game-related words are clearly overrepresented in male channels while words
that signal
objectification are strongly associated with female channels.
Inter-
estingly, such words are not apparent in less popular female channels.
Instead,
the words that signal social interactions such as “hello”, “bye”, and “song” (i.e.,
automated playlist requests) stand out in female channels.
Also note the word
“warning”.
This may suggest that the less popular female channels tend to have
stronger moderation in place,
and tend to be used more as a social
gathering
than a sporting event.
We repeat the same process for bigrams,
which illustrate a similar pattern
(Fig.
3,
right).
Among popular channels,
those belonging to female streamers
are characterized by terms,
presumably directed at the streamer,
about their
physical
appearance;
male channels are instead associated with more game-
related terms.
Again,
less popular female channels do not show clear signs of
objectification.
Additionally,
the results show the contrasting use of
second-
person and third-person pronouns across popular and less popular channels.
In
popular channels,
even though objectifying cues seems to be directed to the
streamer, other bigrams are in third-person.
By contrast, less popular channels
are dominated by second person pronouns.
This observation suggests that di-
rect communication with the streamer dominates in less popular channels while
participating in popular channels resembles watching sporting events.

features from female and male channels we train document
embedding models for the selected 400 channels.

“he”, “she”, “hes”,

“his”,
“her”,
“hims”,
“hers”,
“himself”,
“herself”,
“man”,
“woman”,
“bro”, “boy”, “sir”, “dude”, “girl” and “lady”.
After the preprocessing we train the doc2vec model (see Sec. 2.3).
As noted,
both document vectors and word vectors are trained jointly.
We visualize the
vectors by applying t-SNE, a popular manifold learning (dimensionality reduc-
tion) method [34].
The map suggests clustered structure based on gender (see
Fig. 4).
We then train two classifiers that predict the gender of a streamer by using L2
regularized logistic regression with two sets of features:
bag of words (BoW) and
doc2vec.
We evaluate the model by using 5-fold cross validation.
As a baseline,
we use BoW model with 10,000 features using TF-IDF vectorization [35]. This
model
exhibit the accuracy of
74% (± 0.11%,
95% confidence interval) and a
mean AUC of
0.80 in ROC curve for the holdout test set.
Then we use the
normalized document vectors as the features,
obtaining an accuracy of
87%
(± 0.07%, 95% confidence interval) and a mean area under curve of 0.93.
Let us examine the key features.
For the BoW model, we identify the words
that correspond to the largest absolute coefficient values (see Table 1).
For
the doc2vec-based model,
because it is not straightforward to connect each
feature to a word, we use a different approach; Since the doc2vec model learns
documents and words vectors in the same vector space, we simply identify the
words that are most clearly identified as a female or male document.
We first
extract the top 10,000 words based on frequency in the channel
corpus,
then
identify the words that result in the highest (lowest) probability values in our
classification model (see Table 1).
Our results indicate that female channels are characterized by words about
physical appearance, the body, relationships, and greetings while male channels
are characterized by game-related words.
Male channels are also associated
with many uncommon words, suggesting that the male channel chats are more
diverse while the content in female channels share common words that signal
objectification.
In sum, both our exploratory analysis and classification exercise
suggests that the answer to our first main research question — “are the chat
messages that streamers receive gendered?” — is “yes”.

Analyzing Individual Users
Now we turn our attention from the streamers and the chat messages that they
receive to the viewers and the messages that they produce.
We ask whether
the viewers and their chat messages are also gendered,
by examining gender
preferences in channel selection by users, and their linguistic differences.
We examine whether the selection of which channels to post to is associated
with a given gender by calculating,
for each user,
the percentage of
female
channels that they posted among all (400) channels.
1,818,028 individual users
posted at least one message in at least one of
the 400 channels.
We narrow
it down to 93,898 (5%) active users who have posted at least 100 messages,
primarily to obtain reliable language models.
Our result suggests strong gender
preference in channel selection (see Fig. 5).
Note that if choices were random we
would expect a binomial distribution with a peak at 50%.
By contrast, we see
a strong gender divide.
A large fraction of users (16%), even when we focus on
the users who have posted in more than five channels, have posted only in male
or female channels.
Moreover, if we limit ourselves to users who have posted in
many (10+) channels, a clear peak at 100% — 10 female-channels and 0 male-
channels — is visible, indicating that the choice of chat participation is gendered
and a significant fraction (8%) of users post messages only in female-streamer
channels.
Among 93,898 active users,
there are 20,185 users and 21,883 users
who posted only in female or male channels respectively.
Most of these users
has posted messages in popular channels (see Table. 2).
Let us examine the linguistic differences between those strongly gendered
users.
As described before,
a user’s chat messages is condered as a document
and its vector-space representation is obtained using doc2vec model.
From
42,068 users who posted only in male or female channels, we randomly selected
10,000 (24%) users (4,802 are female-only viewers) and examine them closely.
We first visualize their document vectors with t-SNE (Fig. 6, left).
The map shows a clear separation between the two types of users, suggest-
ing clear lexical
differences.
The map also shows distinct clusters.
We study
the meaning of these clusters by identifying strongly associated words for each
cluster.
Specifically, given a cluster of n document vectors C = {d
1
, d
2
, . . . , d
n
},
we find every word w that is close to many of the documents vectors, satisfying
9
the following condition:
{d ∈ C|S
c
(d, w) ≥ s
min
}
|C|
≥ f
min
,
(4)
where S
c
(d, w) is the cosine similarity between two vectors d and w,
and s
min
and f
min
are two free parameters.
We use s
min
= 0.4 and f
min
= 0.9.
We select eight clusters from the t-SNE map and identify characteristic words
for them (shown in Table 3).
The characteristic words clearly signal the ‘topic’
of
the cluster,
which we use as labels (see Table 3 and Fig.
6).
For instance,
every representative words in the “League of Legends (LoL)” cluster represents
either a position (“junglers”) or a character (“thresh”) in the game.
Some of the
identified clusters are related to streamers (“Kaceytron”,
“Kitty”,
“Trick2g”)
and some are related to games (Dota,
League of Legends (LoL),
Super Smash
Bros (SSB), Dark Souls).
We can also see two clusters related to Spanish lan-
guage and chat moderators.
The terms in the “Mods” cluster are the ids of the
users who are known as moderators for multiple channels.

Table 3:
Representative words for the identified clusters using doc2vec
and t-SNE.
To glean the relationships between these gendered users and their language,
we first pick the two most gender-biased words from Sec.
3.1:
“points” and
“boobs”.
We then calculate the cosine similarity between each of
the word
and user document vectors to identify the user document vectors that are most
similar to one of the two words.
The top 250 users for each word are selected
and overlaid on top of the t-SNE map in Fig. 6 (Right).
The two groups of users
10
are clearly separated on the map.
Interestingly, the identified user clusters tend
to contain only one set of
users.
For instance,
“Kaceytron” cluster is full
of
users whose vectors are highly similar to the vector for “boobs”,
suggesting
that the chat messages made by these users share high semantic similarity with
the word “boobs”.
Indeed, not only she portrays a highly controversial streotype
of female gamer (e.g. “attracting viewers with cleavage”), but also her channel
is famous for not banning anyone nor filtering any comments,
and for directly
responding to abusive comments [36].
By contrast,
the “Trick2g” — a famous
streamer for his game commentaries — cluster only contains users who share
the context with “points”.
Inspired by clear separability of
users based on their gendered language,
we analyze how these gendered viewers are distributed with other gendered
word pairs.
First,
we manually selected eight gendered word pairs from our
exploratory analysis in Sec.
3.1.
From these pairs,
we calculate the difference
vector between the two word vectors; given a pair of words, a game-related one
w
g
and an objectifying one w
o
,
we calculate ~v
g→o
=
−→
w
o
−
−→
w
g
.
This vector,
which roughly estimates the semantic difference between those two vectors,
is
then used to project and compare each user document vector.
A positive cosine
similarity value means the user vector is closer to
−→
w
o
and a negative value
suggests the user vector is closer to
−→
w
g
.
The results,
shown in Fig.
7,
confirm
our intuition.
Viewers who only post in female-streamer channels tend to share
similar context with words that signal
objectification,
while those who post
in male-stream channels only tend to share similar context with game-related
words.
Our analysis suggests that
gendered viewers should be clearly separable
based on their language.
So,
we build classifiers;
again,
we train logistic re-
gression classifiers with BoW and doc2vec features.
In an evaluation using
5-fold cross-validation,
BoW features achieve an accuracy of 96% (± 0%,
95%
confidence interval) and a mean area under curve of 0.99 in ROC curve,
while
doc2vec features achieve 88% (± 1%,
95% confidence interval) accuracy and
a mean area under curve of
0.95 in ROC curve.
The BoW model
performed
surprisingly well in this classification task.
However, our feature analysis shows
that it is a result of identifying trivial
features.
Table.
4 lists the most impor-
tant features in BoW model and most of them are channel-specific terms such
as streamer IDs.
By contrast, the key doc2vec features, inferred by the method
described above, are more general gendered terms.
So far our main focus has been on the majority of users,
who post only in
male or female channels.
Next,
in order to verify whether objectifying traits
are prevalent only in gender-biased individuals, we select a set of 2,734 balanced
users who posted an approximately equal amount of messages in both female and
male chat rooms (female chat percentage between 40-60%).
We then separate
those chat messages into two groups based on the gender of the streamers and
build classification models to predict the gender of the streamer whose chat the
message was written in.
Similar to previous analysis we train two classification
models:
one using doc2vec, and another using BoW. The latter has an accuracy
of
91% (± 0.02,
95% confidence interval) while the former 81% (± 0.01,
95%

Surprisingly, the learned features from both of these meth-
ods are similar to the features learned from the analysis of users who post only
in a specific gendered channels (see Table. 5), suggesting that objectification is
not a result of individual gender preferences, but is commonplace.

Discussion
We reveal a nuanced picture of gendered conversation in Twitch, a social game-
streaming platform.
Returning to the research questions we posed, our analysis
on both streamers and viewers shows that the conversation in Twitch is strongly
gendered.
First, the streamer’s gender is significantly associated with the types
of messages that they receive — male streamers receive more game-related mes-
sages while female streamers receive more objectifying messages.
Second,
the
streamer’s gender is also significantly related to the channels viewers choose to
watch.
Many viewers choose to watch and comment in only male or female
channels and their messages are similarly gendered;
the messages posted by
users who comment only in female channels tend to have semantic similarity
with objectifying cues while those who comment only in male channels tend to
have semantic similarity with more game-related terms.
Even the users who
post in both male and female channels maintain similar linguistic distinction
based on gender; when posting to female channels they tend to choose messages
that have semantic similarity to objectifying cues.
12
Yet, we cannot unequivocally say that Twitch is a conversational hotbed for
gender stereotyping.
In particular, the popularity of channels seems to change
the nature of chat,
not only in terms of information overload [24],
but also in
terms of objectification, moderation, and conversational structure.
Objectifying
cues are only prevalent in popular female channels.
Less popular channels in-
stead exhibit comments from viewers that represent chat moderation.
Moreover,
the user document embedding technique reveals that there exist user clusters
that consist of
famous moderators,
indicating that strong,
effective modera-
tion is in place for many less popular female-streamer channels.
Pronoun usage
also changes depending on the popularity of
channels;
less popular channels
are characterized by usage of second-person pronouns, signaling more intimate
conversation between viewers and streamers, while popular channels exhibit the
pattern that viewers are talking about
streamers,
except when they make ob-
jectifying remarks.
We analyzed the language of
users by employing multiple computational
methods.
Our approach of using log-odds ratio with informative Dirichlet prior
and the doc2vec method effectively revealed the gendered nature of chat mes-
sages.
doc2vec allowed us to look at words and documents in the same space
and also performed better than the BoW features in document classification.
t-SNE and vector arithmetic proved useful
in identifying clusters of terms and
users.
Our methods contribute to growing literature on constructing language
models to identify and unpack gendered phenomena; for instance, we can draw
parallel to models by Fu et al. [37] that found questions posed by journalists to
professional
female tennis players objectified women,
while questions posed to
male players focused were game-related, and by Way et al. [38], who found sub-
tle gender inequalities in faculty hiring practices among universities of different
rankings and career trajectories.
We acknowledge that our analysis has several limitations.
Most notably, we
provide only a static picture of Twitch limited to questions about association
rather than causal
relationships.
While we can only surmise the causes of the
gendered conversation we observed,
financial
motivations may commodify and
incentivize the objectification of
female streamers.
Twitch provides revenue
for streamers through a subscription system,
and many streamers also deploy
donation systems for additional
revenue.
Thus,
financial
incentives exist for
streamers to increase subscribers and possibly to conform to the requests of the
male viewers,
the majority of
many streamers’
“customers”.
Such incentives
may solidify the popularity of
female streamers who do not address (or even
encourage) objectification, facilitating abusive behavior against female gamers.
This vicious cycle may reinforce and spawn the structural
problem of
gender
imbalance in online social gaming communities.
If part of feminism’s remit [39]
is to consider how society,
females included,
may play a role in constructing
what a legitimate female’s identity is in,
for example,
online spaces,
we argue
that we should investigate how Twitch supports heteronormative stereotypes.
Future work may also examine how pathways to popularity differ for male and
female channels.
For instance, do female-streamer channels gradually evolve to
conform to gender stereotypes or allow objectifying comments?
13
Our study also does not investigate how streamers themselves engage view-
ers and the chat.
There are a wide range of
streamers from those who play
games without talking or chatting to those who actively engage with viewers
through frequent gaming events for their audience.
Analyzing streamer behav-
ior is a challenging task requiring analysis of
both the audio and video feeds
of streamers; emerging techniques for analyzing multimedia data may facilitate
future work examining the interplay between streamer behaviors and viewer
behaviors.
Last but not least, our work points to the need to examine the vast number
of
small
communities,
albeit not so popular,
on Twitch whose conversations
do not follow gender lines.
Our analysis shows the existence of
vigilant user
groups who provide moderation services to ensure the conversations revolve
around game-related topics.
This observation paints a less bleak picture of social
gaming.
Might there be a way to bridge between these two disparate spaces of
crowded and intimate spaces? Developing methods for automatic detection of
abusive and objectifying comments as well as other scalable communication and
moderation techniques will also be beneficial for online gaming communities.
