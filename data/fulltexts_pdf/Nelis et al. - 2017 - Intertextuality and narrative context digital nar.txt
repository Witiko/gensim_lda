Abstract 
Within the context of an interdisciplinary research project studying allusion in first century Latin epic, 
we examine some of the shortcomings of current digital methods for detecting poetic allusions through 
text reuse. We discuss the role that textual features above and beyond word identity often play in 
signalling intertextual connections to human readers, in particular, narratological structures and typical 
scenes. We suggest that such features can be captured by performing clustering and/or classification 
on word frequencies in paragraph-sized chunks of text, and propose a possible pipeline for fusing 
similarity measurements based on these ―thematic‖ features with existing metrics produced by the 
intertext search tool Tesserae. While work testing the stability of the proposed features is ongoing, we 
report some promising initial results based on k-means clustering, and describe plans for future work.

INTRODUCTION 
This paper describes ongoing work to improve the results of digital intertextual search 
algorithms in Latin epic poetry by supplementing existing phrase-based matching with a 
feature based on narrative structures. Scholars of intertextuality, both digital and non-digital, 
are already aware of the limits of purely verbal repetition as a proxy for poetic allusion and 
other literary gestures that make reference to earlier texts. In our view, going beyond simple 
lexical reuse should necessarily include consideration of the text at a thematic and a 
contextual level. In the endeavour to bring these additional levels of analysis to bear upon 
existing digital search procedures, one important first step is the development of prototype 
methods for automatically extracting information about narrative structure from the text. A 
second, equally important aspect is the comparison of current computational intertextual 
search results with the products and process of traditional philological reading methods. 
Our team is made up of classicists working with a combination of traditional philological and 
Digital Humanities methods to study the literary history of classical epic. The present project 
is devoted to trying to measure the complexities of text reuse in Latin epic poetry of the 
Flavian period (69-96 CE), contextualised by the larger frame of classical epic tradition.This 
work isfunded by a Swiss National Science Foundation research grant which permits us to 
collaborate with Neil Coffee's Tesserae group at the University at Buffalo. This partnership 
gives our classicist team in Geneva access to a wider range of computational competances 
than would otherwise be available, and provides a unique opportunity to compare the critical 
practices of non-digital philologists with ongoing development and design work in an 
established computational intertextual search project. One potential benefit of such a 
partnership is that close comparison of the priorities and reading habits of the digital and non-

digital teams will not only lead to improvements in each, but ideally also provide occasion for 
reflection and insight into the very nature of intertextual reading. 
I BACKGROUND 
1.1 Verbal reuse and Digital Classics 
For several decades now, classical scholars have been able to search for verbal connections 
between 
Latin 
texts 
by 
searching 
for 
specific 
terms 
in 
databases 
such 
as 
Poetria 
nova[Mastandrea and Tessarolo, 2001],the Packard Humanities Institutecorpus [PHI],the 
Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina Online, or the Brepolis corpus and search tools[CDS][LLT-
A][LLT-B].
1
But the last decade has witnessed a decisive increase in the sophistication of computational 
approaches to intertextual study, and this rapid expansion is transforming our vision of the 
role played by digital tools. More than a simple index or concordance, software is now seen as 
able to intervene in research at all scales and even to contribute to the theoretical definition of 
what constitutes a meaningful intertext [Trillini and Quassdorf, 2010][Coffee et al., 2012]. 
For example, the Musisque Deoque [MQDQ]
2
co-occurrence search allows the researcher to 
compare one particular poem to the wholepoetic corpusand can identify metrical patterns as 
well as words.
3
Fīlum performs similar one-to-many searches using edit distance between 
character strings rather than a dictionary of Latin words, allowing words with different 
lemmata but similar spellings to match[Filum] [Chauduri and Dexter, 2016]. Marco Büchler‘s 
[TRACER] is an open-source, general-purpose text re-use detection tool which, although it is 
not associated with a particular corpus, has been used with success in several classics 
projects.It provides several flexible word n-gram features out of the box, with the option to 
employ stemmers and more complex natural language processing tools if the research has 
them available. Tesserae, also open-source, provides a core classical corpus and several pre-
configured search tools via a web interface[Tesserae]. By default Tesseraematches on lemma 
bi-grams
4
,a relatively small feature in the field of text reuse. This fine-grained sensitivity 
allows Tesseraeto catch the often very brief allusions characteristic of Latin poetry, but at a 
cost:it also returns a large number of false positives which must be filtered out based on 
additional textual features. The parameters of this filtering, as well as the considerations 
involved in designing a model of allusion around text re-use, are discussed in[Coffee et al., 
2012]. 
An important difference between today‘s digital searches and their precursors is that they 
assume a more exploratory mode of research: whereas earlier tools required an a priori term 
or phrase of interest to search for (―how many works use the word arma?‖), these permit more 
open-ended queries (―what similarities exist between the Aeneid and the Amores?‖) and aim 
explicitly at the discovery of the unexpected. As the kindsof questions posed to computational 
tools begins to look more like the subjective, interpretive questions that areof greatest interest 
to scholars, the successes (and importantly also the failures) of these algorithmic approaches 
can shed new light on the behaviour and experience of readers [Scheirer et al., 2016].

We principally use the Tesserae search tool for the digital side of our research. Tesserae‘s 
own evaluation of their search tool‘s performance was, at least initially, largely based on a 
comparison between book 1 of Lucan‘s Bellum Civile and the whole Vergil‘s Aeneid, using 
lemma bi-grams as the only features. ―These works were chosen,‖ its authors argue, ―because 
they were long enough to give representative results, and well studied enough to allow 
comparison with traditional approaches‖ [Coffee et al., 2012]. The choice to focus on epic 
poetry is further justified, in our opinion, because this corpus is recognized as being intensely 
intertextual on the verbal level, and literary allusion in this field has always been seen as 
fundamental to literary analysis. 
At the same time, although lemma bi-grams may represent ―the most basic and common form 
of intertextuality‖ in this corpus, as [Coffee et al., 2012] claim, it is also clear that lemma 
identity alone is not sufficient to characterize intertextuality. [Wills, 1996] describes a large 
set of features which may operate in combination with lexical repetition or even without it to 
build intertextual links between Latin poems. [Bamman and Crane, 2008] have highlighted 
the need for digital intertextual search tools to take into account multiple features including 
word order, syntax, metre and sound similarities as well as the semantic similarity, in order to 
capture ―indirect references‖ as well as direct quotations.
5
The Tesserae team themselves 
estimate, based on their Lucan-Vergil benchmark, that at least one quarter of the allusions 
considered 
significant 
by 
commentaries 
cannot 
be 
caught 
by 
word-based 
matching 
alone[Coffee et al., 2012]. 
We assume that every example of text-reuse recovered by digital means occurs within a 
narrative structure that is sometimes far more likely than individual verbal reminiscences to 
trigger associations among readers, as this has been suggested by major contributors to the 
study of intertextuality in the world of classical scholarship, including [Knauer, 1979], 
[Juhnke, 1973], and [Nelis, 2001]. In our view, elements of this level of prominence should be 
taken into account as a criterion in the automatic detection of intertextuality. It is the goal of 
our project to explore, on the digital side, how we might add one or more narrative features to 
Tesserae‘s existing lemma bi-gram search, and, on the philological side, what sort of results 
we expect to see from a narrative-sensitive tool, above and beyond what is available now. 
1.2Allusion and Intertextuality 
The meaning and scope of the term ―intertextuality‖ are contested. When it was used for the 
first time by Julia Kristeva in 1966, the term had essentially a linguistic-semiotic dimension, 
extending well beyond the narrow world of classical literature: ―Every text,‖ she wrote, 
―constructs itself as a mosaic of quotations, every text is the absorption and transformation of 
another text‖ [Kristeva, 1967]
6
. Yet the term has most frequently seen service in the context 
of literary criticism and philology, and almost from the moment it was coined, scholars have 
continued to modify, challenge, and very frequently to refine and reduce the scope of this 
5
The authors categorized the allusions in two types: the ―direct allusion‖ which can easily be 
identified because is a sort of quotation and the ―indirect reference,‖ a very common form of allusion 
in Latin texts, where the referent text has so lexically changed that it is hardly uncovered by a simple 
string search. Other efforts in this direction are expended by the German [eTRACES] project, whose 
goal is to create new tools for detecting ―winged words and quotations.‖ 
6
―Tout texte se construit comme une mosaïque de citations, tout texte est absorption et transformation 
d‘un autre texte.‖

notion.
7
Classicists 
in 
particular 
have 
engaged 
with 
its 
theoretical 
definition 
and 
its 
application as an interpretive practice, focusing not only on the ways in which texts interact 
with one another but also on the respective roles played by authorial intent and by readerly 
interpretation. Even within classics views diverge significantly on the relative power and 
freedom of the author and the reader in performing the work of making meaning out of the 
links between literary texts.
8
In this paper we assume that there are different degrees of intertextuality, ranging along a 
gradient of subtlety. At one end of this scale is obvious quotation of the source (earlier) text, 
verbally pointed out in the target (later) text; at the other end liesallusion and other literary 
artifice, where source and target texts merge into each other.Our primary interest, here, is in 
the latter. We consider such allusions to be part of the literary design of the author and we are 
interested in understanding how they enrich the meaning of the target text for its audience. 
We work with the idea of a so-called―ideal reader,‖that is, a reader who is capable of 
decoding the allusive strategies and we assume that awareness of references to earlier texts is 
a fundamental element in the whole process of literary communication.
9
Our approach also takes into account multiple tiers of text re-use, that is, analysis of texts 
which contain layers of similarity to several earlier texts, and potentially bear meaningful 
references to all of these predecessors simultaneously. Scholars call this kind of intertextuality 
―window reference,‖ ―double allusion,‖ or ―two-tier allusion,‖ that is ―alluding to a model 
both directly and through an intermediary‖ [Hinds, 1997, 9 and 151][Nelis, 2001, 5]. Each of 
the 
model-texts 
has 
its 
own 
respective 
narrative 
forms 
and 
sequences, 
and 
yet 
in 
the 
juxtaposition of the target and its sources, a pattern emerges which sheds new light on their 
interrelationship. This will be illustrated in the example below (Section II). 
1.3“Heroic” epic poetry 
Our 
Flavian 
epic 
corpus 
consists 
of 
Statius‘ 
Thebais 
and 
Achilleid, 
Valerius 
Flaccus‘ 
Argonautica, and Silius Italicus‘ Punica. These are long poems on mythical (Statius and 
Valerius) 
and 
historical 
(Silius) 
subjects, 
composed 
in 
Latin 
hexameters, 
each 
work 
comprising multiple ―books‖ of many hundreds of lines.
10
It is widely recognized that this poetry marks an important stage in the history of Latin 
intertextuality. Yet, for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the work of these 
authors was generally relegated to an imaginary second division, considered inferior to their 
predecessors in the Augustan age, especially Vergil. The Flavian poets were at best seen as 
representative of a ―silver‖ age, at worst as proof of an irreversible trend towards hopeless 
decadence in Latin literature. In the latter part of the twentieth century, however, this 
dismissive 
approach 
began 
to 
evolve 
significantly, 
as 
a 
series 
of 
important 
studies

For examples, see[Jenny, 1976], [Riffaterre, 1979], [Riffaterre, 1981], and [Genette, 1982].For a 
summary history of these terms and concepts see [Allen, 2011];for their use with respect to Classical 
literature, see [Pucci, 1998], [Edmunds, 2001], and [Baraz and van den Berg, 2013]. 
8
Scholars have tried variously to categorize the multiple kinds of text-reuse, mostly referring to the 
shape or the function of these practices. Such attemps include [Conte, 1974], [Barchiesi, 1984], [Conte 
and Barchiesi, 1989], [Hinds, 1998], [Edmunds, 2001], [Thomas, 1989], and [Fowler, 1997].

Statius‘ Achilleid was interrupted by the author‘s death partway through book 2, but clearly was 
intended by the author to be much longer—he claims in book 1 that the poem will recount the entire 
life of Achilles.

inaugurateda radically new evaluation of these texts.
11
A relevant role in this process of 
renewal has been played by the appreciation of the sophistication of these authors‘ allusive 
techniques, and there can be little doubt today that in the field of complex intertextuality 
much work remains to be done on the corpus of surviving texts at our disposition. 
Although 
within 
the 
Graeco-Roman 
literary 
system 
any 
text‘s 
network 
of 
intertextual 
connections will inevitably extend beyond the bounds of a single literary genre, for the 
purpose of our article we will limit our focus to relationships between texts within the same 
generic framework, i.e. epic poetry. In our computational analysis, we consider the three full-
length epics of our Flavian authors, plus three canonical Latin predecessors of comparable 
size and thematic structure, from which our authors of interest all draw source material for 
their 
intertextual 
connections: 
the 
Aeneid 
of 
Vergil 
(written 
circa 
19 
BCE), 
the 
Metamorphoses of Ovid (ca. 14 CE), and the Bellum Civile of Lucan (ca. 65 CE). 
There is no simple, comprehensive definition of epic poetry because of the organic nature of 
the genre and its long history.
12
Nevertheless, we feel confident that scholars are broadlyin 
agreement as to the following heuristics: that an epic poem is a narrative text, considerable in 
scale, structured in sections or books, written in hexameters;further, thatit consists of a story, 
told by an omniscient narrator, whose action takes place in a mythical or historical past made 
up of gods, heroes and/or historical characters. Within this framework, which encompasses 
some very different works of classical literature, the three Flavians can claim to belong to the 
corpus of what we can call in a rather old-fashioned definition ―heroic‖ epic, whose ancestors 
are obviously the Homeric Iliad and the Odyssey. ―Homer has shown in which rhythm the 
successes of kings and leaders, and ominous wars can be written,‖ prescribed the Roman poet 
Horace in his Art of Poetry.
13
Recognizing its debt to the genre‘s originator, post-Homeric 
epic has continuously imitated and challenged the Homeric poems, which have lastingly 
dominated the literary landscape of Greece and Rome both directly and through the mediation 
of the scholarship of the Hellenistic age. 
1.4 Narrative structure and epic type-scenes 
In describing the scope of phenomena we hope to characterize, we use the collocation 
―narrative structure‖ in a very broad sense, including features as different as the articulation of 
the poem in books and scenes, the alternation of multiple types of ―discourse‖ (narrative, 
speeches, excursus, similes, apostrophes, ekphraseis and so on), and the disposition of 
repeated story elements often called ―type-scenes,‖ or ―typical scenes.‖ It has been recognized 
for a long time now that Homeric poems are structured by large-scale story patterns [Edwards, 
1987]
14
as well as by ―recurrent block[s] of narrative with an identifiable structure, such as a 
11
Over the last thirty years or so, one of the most valuable and exciting trends in the study of Flavian 
epic has been the publication of numerous commentaries on individual books. Some of these have 
achieved almost classic status in our field—among them, notably, [Dewar, 1991], [Smolenaars, 1994], 
[Zissos, 2008], and [Littlewood, 2011]. It is important to note also that these commentaries are 
building on a long tradition of earlier commentaries going back to the Renaissance (as investigated in 
detail for the case of Statius‘ Thebaid by [Berlincourt, 2013] and on such valuable modern 
contributions as [Juhnke, 1972]. 
12
For instance on the discussion about the ‗epic identity‘ of Ovid‘s Metamorphoses and, in general, 
the features which constitute the essence of the genre, see [Hinds, 2000]. 
13
Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella / quo scribi possent numero, monstravit Homerus 
(Hor. arspoetica 73-4). 
14
This idea has seen application beyond the bounds of epic of course—for example by [Levi-Strauss, 
1955]. More specificly to the Homeric tradition, [Edwards, 1987]gives one list of such story patterns

sacrifice, the reception of a guest, the launching and beaching of a ship, the donning of 
armour‖ [Edwards, 1992]. This latter definition encompasses a set of concrete, stereotypical 
actions, taking place in passages approximately the size of a paragraph. It corresponds to the 
units called ―themes‖ by [Lord 1960], and the English equivalent of [Arend, 1975]'s Typische 
Scenen. 
Albert Lord identified the use of type-scenes as a defining characteristic of oral-formulaic 
composition, noting analogous structures in the poetry of contemporary oral cultures outside 
the Graeco-Roman tradition [Lord, 1960]. Edwards who supports the theory of an oral 
composition of the Homeric poemshas pointed out [Edwards, 1992]that these type-scenes 
may be assimilated to the Homeric formulae first identified with the oral style by [Parry, 
1928]. Recently, scholars including [Rubin, 1996] and [Minchin, 2001] have presented 
evidence from cognitive science that certain narrative structures native to or informed by oral 
tradition may be shaped by the way the brain optimises memory and perception, and [Lyne, 
2016] extends at least some of the underlying intertextual mechanisms more explicitly to non-
oral literature. 
Whatever the origins of these structures in Homer and in the oral pre-history from which he 
emerged, it is important for our purposes to emphasize that within the framework of a mainly 
written culture—that is, Hellenistic and Roman literature—these scenes come to play a 
different, 
highly 
literary 
role, 
becoming 
the 
privileged 
places 
for 
confrontation 
and 
consequently for intertextual connections. Following [Edwards, 1992], who claims that ―in 
narratological terms, an amplified type-scene is not necessary to the ‗story‘, . . . but is part of 
the ‗discourse,‘‖ we assume that these scenes can be considered as equivalent to story-telling 
devices in an essentially narratological framework.
15
IICASE STUDY: APOLLONIUS RHODIUS, VERGIL, AND VALERIUS FLACCUS 
We will illustrate the role that similarities in narrative structures can play in 
marking 
intertextual relationships with a passage from the Flavian epic poet Valerius Flaccus, who 
wrote the story of the Argonauts in 8 books.
16
It is well established[Ripoll, 1998] [Liberman, 
1997, xxxii-xlvi], and indeed has been accepted by scholars at least since the beginning of the 
20
th
century [Stroh, 1905], that Valerius‘s poem is profoundly influenced by the Aeneid.For 
instance Philip Hardie points out that Valerius ―shows himself …Virgilian … in his use of 
symmetry and repetition to give form to his poem‖ [Hardie, 1990, 5-9]. At the same time, the 
storyline and structure of Valerius‘ poem are very close to his Hellenistic Greek predecessor, 
Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote his own Argonautica in four books sometime during the 
(withdrawal, devastation, eternal return [order into disorder, then return to order], loss of hero‘s best 
friend, quarrel between heroes, rescue of a man/hero by another one...). 
15
Even within the oral context, there exists a diversity of opinion as to the level of control and artistic 
freedom exerted by the poet in deploying narrative structural elements. Thus [Minchin, 2001, 39-42] 
argues that typical scenes in Homer proceed from an artistic development of existing cognitive 
functions, and stresses the creative originality of the artist.For a large-scale narratological perspective, 
see [Bal, 1978]. As epic is a narrative genre and also an ancestor, so to speak, of the novel, it is a 
frequent subject of narratological theory—see, for instance,[de Jong,2014]‘s Chapter 6, 
―Narratologyand Epic,‖ and her bibliography. As de Jong has pointedout, ―in fact, narratology can be 
said to have started in antiquity, when a number of central concepts weredevelopped‖ [de Jong, 2014, 
3]. 
16
In fact the poem was unfinished, or at any rate it has come to us in fragmentary shape. Nevertheless 
we agree with [Schetter, 1959], who thinks that the poem was designed to be in 8 books and that we 
have missed in the worst case a few hundred lines.

third century BCE. As Andrew Zissos puts it, if ―Valerius makes Virgil his principal model on 
the linguistic, conceptual and thematic levels,‖ then Apollonius is his primary source ―on the 
level of the plot‖ [Zissos, 2009, 508].
17
In particular, it is now clear that Valerius is organizing his text in two different halves (4 + 4 
books) repeating the shape of the Vergilian Aeneid (6 + 6 books) and, at the same time, 
following the thematic bipartition of Apollonius Rhodius' Argonautica (2 books on voyage + 
2 books on love, i.e. the meeting between Jason and Medea and its consequences). Consider 
the parallel thematic sequences 
which cluster 
around the poems‘ respective midpoints, 
schematically represented in Table 1 below. These three poems share not only a macro-
structure (i.e. sea voyage, love story) but also a number of much more specific type-scenes, 
including departure, arrival, burial and invocation to the Muse, in each case laid out in more 
or less the same order at the turning-point of each epic.

By this close alignement, Valerius Flaccus is telling his reader that he has built his story 
against both the Aeneid and the Greek Argonautica,and moreover that he has himself read the 
relationship between Vergil and Apollonius. In acknowledging and extending the existing 
allusive relationship between his two sources, he invites the reader to make sense of this 
intertextual background when trying to understand these sections of the poem. Unfortunately, 
the digitalsearch tools currently available, such as Tesserae, being based on text re-use as the 
model for allusion, will not succeed in highlighting this kind of extremely meaningful 
relations because the texts are verbally connected at a very thin level, sharing only one word 
or lemma. 
Let us look for a moment at one specific allusive locus within this sequence of interrelated 
passages. All three texts interrupt the narrative at its midpoint with an invocation of the Muse, 
a traditional epic gesture signalling a significant new direction in the story: 
Apollonius Rhodius Argonautica 3.1 
Εἰ δ' ἄγε νῦν, Ἐρατώ, 
―Come on, now, Erato‖ 
Vergil Aeneid7.37 
Nunc age…,Erato, 
―Come on, now, Erato‖ 
Valerius Flaccus Argonautics 5.217 
Incipe nunc cantus alios, dea, 
―Begin now, goddess, other songs‖ 
Vergil addresses the Muse Erato in what is not only a translation of Apollonius‘ Greek, but 
very nearly a word for word transliteration. Valerius Flaccus signals his awareness of the 
Vergil-Apollonius 
link 
with 
a 
more 
oblique 
reference, 
avoiding 
the 
Muse‘s 
name 
and 
addressing her simply as ―goddess.‖ At the same time, in a kind of one-upsmanship, he 
exaggerates Vergil‘s delay of the invocation after thecentral book division—what was for 
Apollonius the first line of his poem‘s second halfbecomes line 37 in Vergil and 217 in 
Valerius. To a human reader engaged in close reading, the three invocations to the Muse are 
unmistakably related. Yet a lemma-based automatic readingwould lose the match, if not 
between Apollonius and Vergil,
18
certainly between Valerius Flaccus and the other two. What 
is needed in order to catch the significance of Valerius‘ faint verbal repetition is sensitivity to 
the surrounding context—the alignment of the surrounding themes, proximity to the book 
division, and the identity of the discursive mode.
19
The question posed by the computational 
18
It might not be strictly appropriate to call any automatic match between a Greek source and a Latin 
target text simple ―lemma‖ matching, since the lemmata are obviously different. While such cross-
language matching is not reliably provided by the tools online today, an experimental version Greek-
Latin search is available through [Tesserae]. This search in fact is based around the notion that each 
lemma in Greek ought to have some close equivalent in Latin, and, having calculated the best 
―translation‖ of each Greek word, then proceeds as a lemma-based search [Gawley et al., 2014]. In 
theory, much more sophisticated machine translation techniques exist, and we hope to see their 
application to this problem soon.

As Jeffrey Wills shows, ―[a]lthough allusions through content or context are obvious enough,‖ the 
combination of multiple features can strengthen connections where any one feature might not be 
sufficient [Wills, 1996, 18]. This includes in particular ―positional marking (in relationship to line- or

component of this project is to what degree these narrative elements can be successfully 
extracted from the text. 
IIIDIGITAL METHODS 
3.1General goals 
The digital aspect of this research has two related goals. The principal question is whether 
what we call ―thematic features‖ can be successfully integrated into the automatic scoring of 
intertextual 
search 
resultson 
a 
purely 
verbal 
level. 
That 
is, 
does 
similarity 
of 
theme, 
narratological structure, or other contextual features contribute in a systematic way to the 
reader‘s perception of a verbal allusion‘s literary significance? If so, this kind of similarity 
can be used in the way we currently employ the frequency and proximity of specific matching 
words to predict the relevance of results[Forstall et al., 2015].A closely related, secondary 
goal is to extract thematic features from the text automatically, that is, unsupervised or semi-
supervised tagging of the corpus for at least the most important type scenes, narrative devices, 
and so on. The work reported here pertains principally to this latter, secondary goal;even so,its 
development and its evaluation always take place within the larger theoretical context of 
evaluating allusivity. 
It is important to note that in theory our principal goal, predicting allusive significance, does 
not depend on achieving the secondary goal of extracting thematic features automatically. In 
particular, it is plausible from the point of view of the Tesseraescoring system to employ a set 
of thematic tags assigned manually. Moreover, although complete classification of the themes 
of the classical corpus by hand represents a monumental task, it is not entirely out of the 
question, as it would be, for example, in a living and growing contemporary canon. For at 
least some subsets of Greek and Latin literature, in fact, such hand-tagging is being attempted. 
Thus, the Epische Bauformen project, directed by Christiane Reitz at the Universität Rostock, 
for example, is embarking on a mission to create a typology and catalogue of the type scenes 
of Greek and Latin epic poetry over the next three years, and envision making the entire 
catalogue 
available 
afterwards 
in 
a 
machine-accessible 
format 
[EB].Likewise, 
the 
collaborative interdisciplinary project Memorata Poetis, bringing together researchers at 
several Italian universities, is currently engaged in manually tagging the major themes in a 
corpus of Latin, Greek, Italian and Arabic epigrams [MP]. This database, which counts Paolo 
Mastandrea among its principal investigators, is currently online and searchable, although still 
in progress, and is apparently to be made compatible with the [MQDQ] allusion search 
engine. 
At the same time, the ability to automatically extract such information from the texts with 
much less human effort would provide an important complement to such databases. First, 
although as classical philologists we have the good fortune to work on relatively small and 
closed corpora, to devote this level of attention to the entire extant classical canon would 
require more resources than our field can afford at present. Indeed, one of the lessons of the 
digital humanities is that the greatest potential to learn something new about our field often 
comes from the examination of those more marginal and less-frequently studied texts that are 
often the last to receive careful treatment by hand. 
book-boundaries)‖ [Wills, 1996, 22]. Putting these together, ―sequential order seems another possible 
element of this grammar of allusion‖ [Wills, 1996, 27].

ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal 
Second, it is important that we look beyond the borders of our discipline, and make the case 
that our research has relevance to the study of literature more generally. We would hope that 
the search for intertextuality would be equally interesting when applied to much larger, open 
corpora, 
where 
manual 
tagging 
was 
not 
a 
feasible 
option. 
At 
least 
some 
branches 
of 
intertextual theory specifically argue that literary activity takes place in the vast, open system 
of our total semiotic environment, including texts outside the genre in question, everyday 
language, and even non-linguistic sign systems. [Fowler, 1997], for example, notes the growth 
of the view that, ―intertextuality is a property of language-and of semiotic systems in 
general-not simply of literature.‖ A method that could be generalized to something larger than 
our own proprietary, manually-prepared corpus would be potentially valuable to others, and at 
the same time invite collaboration and comparison that could benefit and add context to the 
present study. 
Finally, although the automation of feature-extraction is proposed as secondary to and in 
support of the principal goal of improving our scoring functionality, we believe that, if 
successful, it also represents an important end in itself, namely the modeling of readerly 
behavior. To the extent that we can use surface textual features to identify where readers are 
most likely to identify coherent and transcendent themes, we will better understand how such 
themes 
evolve 
out 
of 
the 
continuous, 
but 
ephemeral, 
stream 
of 
poetic 
composition, 
performance and transmission. This is a particularly pertinent line of research in the study of 
classical epic, which draws so much, even in its later and highly literary forms, from the oral 
tradition. While it is clear that the Roman poets, who in emulating one another also emulated 
Homer, felt that type scenes were a necessary and defining feature of the epic genre, 
nevertheless the question of how closely two scenes must resemble each other in order to 
belong to the same ―type‖ was for them, as it is for us, a subjective one. In attempting to 
model such judgments, to identify the textual features on which that subjectivity is nourished, 
we shine new light on what it is to read and to make meaning from these works. 
Work on the automatic classification of type scenes is still exploratory, but we plan a two-part 
program, 
comprising 
supervised 
and 
unsupervised 
approaches. 
At 
the 
moment 
we 
are 
undertaking the beginning of the unsupervised approach, which consists in four discrete steps: 
sampling, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. At the same time we 
arepreparing hand-tagged data for training the supervised approach, also to be used for testing 
of both approaches. 
3.2Sampling 
Sampling has traditionally been a thorny problem in the analysis of literary texts because the 
questions posed are often particularly finely-grained, as here, while at the same time the 
amount of text available is often small in comparison with other stylometric applications such 
as forensics or broader cultural studies. In particular, [Eder, 2015] cautions that for Latin 
poetry, 
samples 
of 
several 
thousand 
lines 
are 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
extract 
a 
reliable 
stylometric signal from a work, and also underlines the need for random rather than sequential 
sampling to ensure that the samples are representative. While we take these considerations 
very seriously, they are somewhat complicated by the nature of our object of study. The bulk 
of such stylometric feature extraction aims to characterize a unique, and relatively constant 
signal associated with a particular, author, work, or genre. Here, however, we are interested in 
bringing to light the internal heterogeneity of individual works, and, by contrast, the stability 
across the corpus of the different component structures employed in their composition. We 
therefore continue to use passages of consecutive lines in building our samples, since a 
11 
Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities 
http://jdmdh.episciences.org 
ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal 
defining feature of the epic typical scene is that it is in fact one, coherent passage of text.
20
Our samples must necessarily be small, as the scenes we hope to identify are often fewer than 
100 verse lines in length. At the same time, the degree to which automated feature extraction 
methods will tolerate such fine-grained sampling is an open question. [Scheirer et al., 2016] 
considered the use of topic modelling for allusion in Latin and offered some positive results 
tempered by cautionary examples. The authorsfound that two popular implementations of 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Gensim [Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010] and MALLET [McCallum, 
2002],while potentially useful at capturing something very like the type of similarity we are 
looking for, became unstable at sample sizes below several hundred lines, but that Gensim‘s 
implementation of Latent Semantic Indexing produced stable results for passages of the size 
considered here [Scheirer et al., 2016]. 
The other important consideration in sampling is the irregularity of the passages we hope to 
find. Our type scenes vary widely in length, and may be found anywhere within the texts we 
are searching. With too-large, and fixed-size samples, there is a danger that scenes falling 
between two samples will be so diluted by the surrounding material that their signals are 
unrecognizable. One solution would be an ability to accommodate irregularly sized samples, 
and ideally to identify the borders automatically though a bootstrapping process where 
samples were successively re-aligned so as to maximize the differences in their signals. A 
second option is to automatically detect editorial indications of scene change, such as 
whitespace between paragraphs, punctuation marks indicating speech boundaries, and the 
numbering of books and verses. Much of this information is already in machine-readable form 
in the TEI XML documents, downloaded from the Perseus Digital Library [Perseus], which 
form the basis of our corpus.
21
It must be noted, however, that use of this information 
resituates our unsupervised approach rather under a ―semi-supervised‖ rubric. 
For the work discussed here we have used an entirely unsupervised approach to sampling, 
taking samples of 50 consecutive verse lines. As a step towards the bootstrap method 
proposed above, we created 10 independent runs by changing the sampling window offset in 
five-line increments (i.e. with sample 1 beginning, respectively, at line 1, 6, 11, and so on). 
Each of these runs was treated independently through the remaining steps of the experiment—
feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. After classification, the results 
across all runs were compared on a line-by-line basis. Our hypothesis was that those lines 
which tended to have more stable classifications across multiple runs would represent regions 
of the text more firmly embedded within typical thematic material, while lines whose 
classification varied with the sampling offset would be more likely to represent transitional 
regions or otherwise less-stereotypical material. While in initial experiments the most stable 
areas have tended to correspond to typical scenes, we don‘t yet have enough evidence to 
claim that the method works generally, or to take the next steps towards fully automating the 
identification of irregular sample bounds. 
20
Homer famously portrays all action as sequential—[Scott, 1921, 158-159] goes so far as to claim 
that oral style made it ―impossible for the poet to picture events as taking place simultaneously.‖ 
While this seems unfair to the narrative sophistication of the Odyssey in particular, and while Homer‘s 
Hellenistic and Roman successors continue to refine and develop the handling of epic time, it is safe to 
assume that we will not encounter the type of interleaved narration of independent scenes found, for 
example, in modern novels. 
21
Preliminary work described here used XML versions of the texts downloaded directly from the 
[Perseus] website between 2010 and 2014; we are currently updating our texts to correspond with the 
corpus available on GitHub at https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit. The specific text files 
we used are also available on GitHub at https://github.com/cwf2/dh2016.

In comparison to this process, we have also tested, in a different but related study, a sample 
set defined by editorial scene boundaries, as taken from a modern published commentary. 
Compared with fixed-length samples, in that experiment the samples defined by editorially 
defined boundaries tended to show stronger and more heterogeneous stylistic signatures 
[Forstall and Galli Milić, 2015]. 
3.3Feature extraction 
The features we are using for this work are relatively simple, bag-of-words lexical features 
based on term frequency / inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weights of the lemmatized 
Latin words. We exclude a stoplist of words that occur in more than half of all samples; 
although the precise list can vary based on the sampling, this tends to amount to the top 50-60 
lemmata. While for the most part these are function words (et, qui, in, sum, hic, tu, and the 
like), a stoplist based solely on the number of samples in which words appear also includes 
generically important, but ubiquitous, content words such as arma, bellum, magnus, and deus. 
It is not inconceivable that such words, though present throughout the work, play special roles 
in defining particular type scenes, and should thus be included. This remains to be tested in 
future experiments. Finally, hapax legomena are also excluded. Intuitively, this seems an 
obvious step, but it is worth noting that in fact the pointed use of Homeric hapax legomena 
was an established intertextual gesture for later authors. It is possible, in fact, that a word 
found nowhere else in a specific canon nevertheless has a set of correspondences with other 
rare words in analogous passages, words which share not a common lemma or meaning but 
merely their rarity—what [Wills, 1996, 22] calls ―frequency marking.‖ 
3.4Dimensionality reduction 
Each sample was thus characterized by the tf-idf weights of all remaining lemmata. Again, 
while the specific number of terms varied somewhat with the sampling, this was on the order 
of seven or eight thousand for our corpus of six Latin epics. We used principal component 
analysis (PCA) to reduce this to the first 500 principal components. The use of PCA greatly 
reduced compute time for classification; we are still in the process of testing whether it 
reduces or improves classification accuracy over the original feature vectors, as well as the 
optimal number of dimensions for the reduced features. It would seem natural that methods 
from the field of topic modeling should be appropriate to this study. While initially wary of 
the small sample size, we are encouraged by the results of [Scheirer et al., 2016] and more 
recently [Köntges, 2016], and we are currently working to adapt these methods to our own 
pipeline. 
3.5Clustering 
Samples in a given run were clustered by the resulting feature vectors using k-means 
clustering. We had no a priori expectation as to the number of clusters, and so we attempted 
to determine the most appropriate value for k experimentally. We tested values between 2 and 
12. For each value of k, we repeated theclustering process 15 different times (Figure 1). 
Because initial cluster centers were selected randomly, the resulting assignment of samples to 
clusters could differ among the 15 repetitions. We tested agreement between repetitions by 
doing pairwise comparisons of the 150 resulting cluster assignments (10 different runs, with 
15 repetitions for each, Figure 2).The group assigned to a given sample was applied to each of 
the lines that made up that sample—considering lines rather than the samples allowed us to 
compare the tendency of specific lines cluster together even among runs with different 
sampling offsets. To measure agreement between any two clusterings we used the adjusted 
Rand index, which gives a value between 0 and 1 for two sets of sample labels, 1 representing 
13 
Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities 
http://jdmdh.episciences.org 
ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal 
perfect agreement, and 0 representing the level of agreement expected by chance. The 
stability of results for each value of k was approximated by an average adjusted Rand index 
for all pairwise comparisons. Preliminary results suggest that five or six clusters represent the 
limits of this method; higher values of k produce increasingly unstable classifications (Figure 
3). However, this process was not combined with the bootstrapping method for determining 
sample boundaries. It is possible that with more precisely defined samples, a greater diversity 
of clusters could be reliably distinguished.

Figure 3. Sample-by-sample stability of repeated k-means clustering, for varying values of k.For each value of k 
we measured the adjusted Rand index for every possible pair of 150 different clusterings. Each column thus 
represents 11175 values of this metric. Mean agreement decreases with increasing k; in initial experiments we 
preferred k=6 as a compromise between stability and precision. 
3.6Authorship signal adjustment 
The initial clustering experiments demonstrated that even with small samples of consecutive 
verse lines, and even 
with a significant stoplist of most frequent words removed, the 
predominant factor in clustering was authorship. Figure 4 shows the distribution of samples 
within the reduced feature space after PCA; even with only two principal components it can 
be seen that samples fall into distinct regions according to author. In particular, Ovid‘s 
Metamorphoses, Lucan‘s Bellum Civile, and Silius Italicus‘ Punica are localised in separate 
portions, around the periphery of the space. Vergil‘s Aeneid, Statius‘ Thebaid, and Valerius 
Flaccus‘

space. For Lucan, Ovid, and Silius Italicus in particular, the first two principal components alone allow for 
almost complete separation by author. 
Figure 5. Agreement between clustering by k-means and true authorship, by k. For a wide range of k, 
unsupervised assignment to clusters corresponds highly with true authorship; this effect peaks around k=6, the 
true number of authors. Each sample was represented by the first 10 principal components derived from tf-idf 
weights, as described above. It is clear that automated clustering for this feature set primarily groups samples by 
author. 
The results of k-means clustering of these samples correlates strongly with true authorship 
(Figure 5). In particular, agreement between clustering and true authorship peaks at values of 
k around 6, the number of authors in the corpus. 
In order to compensate for the effects of authorship, we created a ―mean author signal‖ for 
each work, subtracting from every sample in that work the mean vector for the work as a 
whole. This had the effect of centering each work within the feature space, while retaining the 
heterogeneity of its component samples (Figure 6). This was done after feature reduction, and 
the new, author-adjusted feature set was then put through the clustering stage as described 
above. This procedure eliminated the correlation between clustering and true authorship 
shown in Fig. 5 above. 
Figure 6. The same feature space as Fig. 4, but with samples adjusted for mean author signal. Each cloud of 
samples representing a single author‘s work has been independently recentered, so that all authors overlap, while 
preserving the relative distances between samples within each author.

3.7Verse-by-verse stability measurements 
Our hypothesis is that certain passages in these poems share stereotypical language that 
identifies 
them 
as 
type 
scenes 
belonging 
to 
specific, 
canonical 
types—tempest 
at 
sea, 
catalogue of warriors, lion among the herds, etc.—while the bulk of each poem is dominated 
by original, creative content. Our samples are taken from across the corpus, and recentered by 
author. The feature space now represents the internal heterogeneityof these poems, the 
diversity of language which occurs even within each author. It is our hope that in this space 
we will find small clusters of samples that partake of common thematic language, but it is also 
our expectation that most of the samples will not cluster reliably, since the work of the poet is 
generally to ―make it new,‖ as Ezra Pound put it, rather than simply to rearrange static 
thematic building blocks. 
We test this hypothesis by 
comparing the stability of the labels assigned by k-means 
clustering line-by-line through each work. As in the selection of k, we use stability across 
multiple re-clusterings as a clue to the coherence of the underlying clusters. Passages from 
different works that partake of a common, special vocabulary connected with a particular 
typical scene ought to be placed reliably in the same cluster across many repetitions of the 
sampling and clustering process. Although the lines of such a passage may be grouped 
differently as the sampling window moves from run to run, if the passage is long enough, we 
should see consistency overall when we consider a large number of trials at different offsets. 
As above, we apply the cluster label for each sample individually to the lines that make it up, 
allowing us to compare labels between runs even when they have different offsets. We then 
measure the degree to which each line of the corpus tends to be assigned to a reliable cluster 
in randomly selected pairs of trials. Of the 150 different sets of cluster labels we have for the 
verse-lines of the corpus, we choose two at a time and use the R package mclust‘s classError() 
function to create the best possible alignment of cluster labels between the two trials. Those 
lines whose labels cannot be harmonized are labeled as misclassified by classError(). Over a 
large number of such comparisons, we calculate the rate at which each line of the corpus is 
assigned to the same cluster in both trials,according to the harmonized labels. We hope that 
this success rate will serve as a clue to regions of stereotypical language. 
3.8Hand tagging 
In further work, we will systematically compare the consistency of cluster labels line by line 
to manual scene labels assigned by human readers. A definitive, ―gold standard‖ database of 
scene labels is for the moment out of our reach, and thus validation of these results remains a 
work in progress. Ourcurrent local database of hand-tagged type assignments was developed 
entirely by two post-doctoral researchers, and limited to a somewhat arbitrary repertory of 
scene types, of which those with the most numerous tagged examples are tempest and battle 
scenes. While such a limited approach, relying on the personal judgments of a very small set 
of readers, has proven sufficient for prototyping to this point, we will ultimately need a more 
diverse data set for robust training and testing. One potential source is the Epische Bauformen 
project mentioned above [EB]. Two other sources to which we have turned in the past are the 
work of graduate students, performed for credit in seminars, and published commentaries 
which, at least in some cases, contain internal classification schemes or habits of description 
consistent enough to be amenable to coding and digital transcription.

To a certain degree, the influence of commentaries is already present in the passages tagged 
so far, in that the classification of scene types is loosely based on that of [Edwards, 1987] and 
the boundaries of scenes are in most cases determined by the editorial choices of the editions 
used. That is, the majority of the researchers‘ attention is focused on evaluating which of the 
scene types best suits the passage under consideration, the boundaries of which are considered 
closely only in cases where ambiguity is apparent. In a future, larger-scale phase of data 
collection, this methodology will have to be more strictly controlled, especially as the 
broadening of the readership whose judgements are consulted will necessarily increase the 
complexity of this subjective process. 
IVPRELIMINARY RESULTS 
Results to this point have shown limited success, suggesting that the unsupervised method for 
extracting thematic features has potential, but also that it will likely be improved by closer 
study of the ways in which our human readers recognize typical scenes. Considering the 
tempest scenes which represent our most complete human-tagged benchmark at this point, we 
identified the longest example of this type for each of the authors in our corpus. Of these six 
scenes, five were flagged as containing lines consistently assigned to the same cluster across 
multiple trials (Figures 7-11) while one showed no difference in cluster stability from the 
surrounding material (Figure 12). 
Figure 7. Line-by-line cluster stability across a random selection of100 trials, for book 1 of Vergil‘s Aeneid. 
While most trials disagreed about the clusters to which most lines were assigned, nevertheless a few passages 
were assigned to the same clusters in significant numbers of trials. In particular, a group of lines coinciding with 
the tempest scene of this book were clustered together consistently across trials, regardless of the sampling 
window offset. In this plot, the line shows the number of times two randomly selected trials agreed as to the 
assignment of a certain line, out of 100 such comparisons. The colored bar at bottom shows our ground truth, the 
lines independently assigned to the tempest scene by human annotators. This is the classic scene in which 
Aeolus, king of the winds, lets loose a storm at sea at Juno‘s command in order to hinder and punish the Trojans.

Figure 8. Line-by-line stability measurements, as in Figure 7, detail showing book 1 of Ovid‘sMetamorphoses. 
Again, the great majority of the poem did not show any consistency across trials, but a few small passages 
showed high stability. The scene marked by our human readers here was the story of the deluge, in which Jupiter 
sets out to destroy the world by flood. Of the six definitive tempest scenes selected for our benchmark, this is in 
some ways the furthest from the classic epic ideal; nevertheless, its allusive connections to e.g. Aeneid 1.81-1.30 
(Fig. 7) are well established [Anderson, 1997, ad loc.].

with an unusually consistent cluster stability, while most of the poem‘s verse lines fluctuate much more.

Figure 12. Line-by-line cluster stability, as in the preceding figures.Detail showing the pre-selected tempest 
scene for Silius Italicus‘ Punica, lines 12.609-12.663.Here, Hannibal and his troops threaten the gates of Rome, 
but Jupiter brings a terrible storm to the city‘s defense. Unlike the five previous cases, the passage determined to 
be the poem‘s most significant example of the tempest type scene was unremarkable in terms of cluster stability. 
Indeed, while a few brief sections exceeded this one in stability, none of the lines in this book showed a level of 
clustering consistency across trials comparable to that seen in the other five passages studied. 
VFUTURE WORK 
5.1 Continued work on theme extraction 
In general, the poems showed great variation in stability from line to line. At the same time, 
over multiple comparisons, the boundaries of passages found to be stable were consistent. It 
would appear that the choice of tempests for the human tagging task was serendipitous: not 
only was the stability signal strong in five out of six cases, but in fact in most cases the pre-
selected region of interest demonstrated the strongest stability in its respective book. Based on 
the graphs examined here, it seems unlikely that similarly striking success will be achieved 
with every one of the types that has been identified in catalogues such as [Edwards, 1987]. As 
work on the benchmark tags proceeds, we will be better able to put the results shown here in 
the context of a larger repertoire of thematic narrative elements. 
The success of this method at flagging the passages independently selected by readers as 
worthy of interest belongs to the recall domain discussed above; the complementary ability in 
terms of precision can be measured by the degree to which other passages flagged as stable 
also turn out to contain typical thematic material. A related task will be to examine larger 
patterns of stability over the entire corpus, and to determine whether the simple percentage of 
misclassifications used here can be better calibrated to readers‘ impressions of the text. 
5.2Supervised approach 
In the supervised approach, we begin from hand-tagged texts subdivided into unequal samples 
according to editoral indications and according to the subjective judgements of our human

Although we have not yet implemented the remaining steps, we plan on 
implementing an analogous process to that found in the unsupervised method: feature 
extraction using tf-tdf scores, followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA and 
adjustment for mean authorship signals. 
We are considering a limited number of type scenes for the present, about a dozen, in order to 
test the viability of the general concept with thematic elements widely acknowledged as core 
to the genre, before wading into detailed discussion of exactly what constitutes a typical scene 
and how finely one ought to divide their classification. This also means the results will have a 
granularity roughly comparable to those from the unsupervised approach. 
To model the human classification of the resulting features, we intend to use a linear support 
vector machine (SVM), a method with which we have some experience and which has 
produced successful results in literary applications in the past.
24
5.3Application to text-reuse scoring 
The success of our project‘s primary objective will be evaluated using cases of text reuse in 
Valerius Flaccus‘ Argonautica, ranked by readers familiar with the poem and its precedents 
for their allusive significance. This set of parallels will be generated using the Tesserae search 
engine, which returns instances where a verse line in Valerius reuses at least two words from 
a verse line in one of his predecessors. These are ranked by Tesserae according to the 
frequency and proximity of the matching words. Tesserae regularly employs a cutoff score to 
weed out the vast number of cases where reuse of small phrases has no literary significance. 
We will evaluate the performance of this automated ranking using independent measures of 
recall and precision. For us, recall indicates the ability of the scoring system to place specific 
instances of text reuse previously identified by readers as significant above an arbitrary score, 
which can then be used as the cutoff; while precision indicates the proportion of all results 
above the given threshold that are deemed interesting after the search is done and the cutoff 
chosen. 
We do not attempt to combine precision and recall in a single metric such as the F1 measure. 
In fact, our measures of recall and precision are not entirely commensurate, since they deal 
with different populations. For us, recall answers the question, how many of the allusions that 
we knew we wanted did we actually get? It does not have any way to measure the 
serendipitous discovery of new, interesting intertexts, even though this is in fact a core 
function of search tools like Tesserae. Precision, on the other hand, answers the question, how 
many uninteresting cases did we have to sift through, even above the cutoff score? This is 
really more a measure of our patience with the machine than it is a measure of what 
proportion of all true negative results were excluded. 
At bottom, the incommensurability of these two metrics comes from the subjective nature of 
intertextuality and literary interpretation: we consider it impossible in principle to define once 
and for all the set of all ―true‖ allusions, since what constitutes an allusion depends largely on 
23
We consulted the following editions for paragraph and scene breaks: for Vergil, the online edition of 
Itinera Electronica[IE]; for Ovid, [Miller and Goold, 1977] and [Miller and Goold, 1984]; for Lucan, 
[Bourgery, 1927] and [Bourgery and Ponchont, 1930]; for Valerius Flaccus, [Liberman, 1997] and 
[Liberman, 2002]; for Silius Italicus, [Nisard 1855]; and for Statius, [Nisard, 1878]. 
24
For example, [Zhao and Zobel, 2003] show the utility of SVMs in traditional authorship attribution 
tasks using stylistic features on literary texts. [Forstall et al., 2011] is one attempt by members of our 
team to broaden the literary application of linear SVMs to more open-ended, literary critical tasks.

the experience of the reader. What we can attempt to model, however, is the degree to which 
the algorithm fulfills our expectations (recall) and at the same time avoids what we don‘t want 
(precision). 
In judging the success of the thematic features, then, we will take Tesserae‘s best recall and 
precision measures for searches on Valerius Flaccus as a baseline. We will then adjust 
Tesserae‘s scores by adding an extra term to account for whether the source and target phrases 
share thematic features. The best achievable recall and precision will again be evaluated, 
systematically testing various treatments of the thematic term and adjusting the cutoff. To the 
extent that better recall and / or precision are achieved, we will judge the new featureset to be 
useful.
