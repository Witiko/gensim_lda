Abstract.
This paper presents an alternative interface for browsing in the
Czech Digital Mathematics Library (DML-CZ) using our Visual Browser
web browsing tool. Using dynamic visualization, we have created a tool
for browsing the library graphically. Visualization can help users orient
themselves in complex data and at
the same time reveal
sometimes
unexpected relationships among units; it at least speeds up browsing.
This work follows the metadata processing undertaken on DML-CZ and
visualizes all reasonable and useful relationships among journals, issues,
articles, authors, classification, keywords, references and similar articles.
We converted metadata to RDF and use a Visual Browser Java Applet
that runs in a web browser. We describe briefly the metadata nature, then
server and client side of the visualization including data formats and
conversions. There follows a description of the interaction between visual
and textual interfaces.
Key words:
visualization, RDF, visual interface, Visual Browser, DML-CZ,

Introduction
This paper presents dynamic visual interface for browsing the Czech Digital
Mathematics Library (DML-CZ) as an alternative to a textual listing. We are
offering the interface to the ongoing EuDML project
1
[
13
].
The DML-CZ [
1
]
currently contains more than 28,000 articles in 11 journals, 5 proceedings series
and 28 monographs [
6
]. Users usually do not browse within such a vast amount
of data, rather they search for titles or authors.
On the search results page users can see the number of search results and
the list of articles. When clicking on an article, the information listed below is
shown:
–
bibliographic information about
the article (author,
title,
serial,
year,
Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) [7], . . . );
– preview of the article and link to the PDF;
– link to similar articles;
– references with links to articles where possible.

The particular advantage of the DML-CZ interface is that it finds similar
articles
in search results.
Three methods
for
calculating similarities
are
used [
10
] and the percentages are expressed graphically.
This is so far the
only information that is visualized.
Nevertheless according to [
14
] a good
visualization helps accelerating the cognitive process, since the eyes can pick
up details of the visualization and keep a holistic overview at the same time.
Visualization is most suitable for complex and relatively sparse data and this is
precisely the case of library data.
Google has started to offer a graphical interface for search results in addition
to the standard view: their so-called Google Wonder Wheel
2
has both plain text
and timelines.
Information seekers who would tend to use it,
are likely to
appreciate it for not only Google searches.
The structure of paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe the server side
including data formats provided by the server. Section 3 briefly describes the
Visual Browser and shows the interaction between the Visual Browser and the
textual listing on the web page. Section 4 contains both the conclusion and the
future development that the dynamic visual interface may undergo.

Server Side
Since the amount of data in DML-CZ is very large, a client-server architecture
is the most suitable. The server has to store the data, provide a method for its
retrieval and quickly return a small amount of the data requested.
2.1
Data Formats
Because the client side uses RDF [
2
], the server has also to provide this format.
We had to convert the existing XML format of metadata to RDF. This conversion
required the following steps:
–
selecting only the appropriate data for visualization (some information is
omitted);
– assigning IDs for articles, issues, journals and authors;
– adding short titles for the visualization;
– conversion of the
lang
attribute according to RFC 3066 sec. 2.3 [12];
– adding information about similar articles;
– adding MSC labels.
2.2
RDF Server
Joseki RDF Server
3
was used. It offers SPARQL [
9
] as a query language. Joseki
was selected because of the Jena Framework
4
used in the client. Nevertheless,
the server side can be substituted by any other RDF server if needed. The data
is stored in a relational database.

Client Side
On the client side two interfaces are used:
a traditional textual interface (a
list of authors and articles) and the Visual
Browser [
8
].
The latter is a tool
for the dynamic (animated) visualization of RDF graphs. It provides flexible
visualization thanks to the two-layer architecture:
–
first
layer—the data stored in RDF (whether in RDF/XML,
N3 [
3
]
or
Turtle [5]);
–
second layer—perspective of view, an XML description of graphic representa-
tion of nodes and edges of the graph.
The visualization of different types of data is described below.
The Visual Browser exists either as a standalone Java application or as a Java
applet.
The applet can communicate with textual parts of the search results
page. The interaction Java Applet—web page was made through AJAX
5
plus
JavaScript to communicate with the applet.
Submitting the search field or browsing data in one of the interfaces results
in a SPARQL query. The server evaluates the query and returns an RDF graph.
The XSLT [4] conversion is made and the result is returned as a list of authors
and titles.
The communication between the applet and the web page is bi-
directional:
clicking on a name or title in the list renders a set of nodes and
edges in the visual interface, a set of nodes and edges can be displayed as a list
of authors and articles.
We expect users to type (part of) a name or title in the search box.
Then
users can browse either the more familiar textual interface (as they are used
to), or the visual one. Conversely, when viewing a particular subgraph in the
Visual Browser, users can click to have it appear it in the textual interface as
seen in Figure 1.

users to choose how they browse the results. For this purpose, it is necessary
that the interfaces are able to communicate.

3.1
Visualizing Metadata
In this visualization,
nodes represent units such as authors,
articles,
issues,
journals,
and keywords and MSC as well.
Different
classes of
units are
represented by different colours and shapes.
Mapping from logical entities
to their visual attributes is fully configurable in Visual Browser.
Edges represent
authors and their articles,
articles in issues,
issues in
journals,
as well
as links between similar articles.
Some of these relations
are structural (e.g.
articles in issues),
some are semantic (e.g.
classification of
articles),
some have both aspects (authors of articles).
We have to evaluate
users’
behaviour to decide what types of relations are useful
for browsing.
Even though we expect
semantic relations to be more important
than the
structural ones, we nevertheless display both types of relations. Similarly to the
visualization of nodes, the appearance of the edge (its colour, shape and length)
distinguishes different classes of edges.
Pointing cursor on a node opens a small po-up window with a short text.
This can be helpful when displaying titles or even abstracts as seen in Figure 2.
Fig. 2.

pop-up in a small window
3.2
Visualizing Similarities
The current interface for DML-CZ provides information about semantically
similar articles. Similarities have been pre-calculated [11] using three different
methods [
10
]. Similar articles are connected with edges of different lengths; the
shorter the edge,
the more similar two articles are (see Figure 3 on the next
page).

Fig. 3.
Visualization of similarities:
the length of the edge is also a bearer of
meaning; with edge labels displayed, one can also see similarities expressed by
numbers
3.3
Visualizing References
Scientific articles usually cite other sources.
These citations (references) are
related to a topic mentioned in that article and therefore can help users who
have already read the article and are looking for further reading. The required
state will
be that
users can browse references to articles regardless of the
repository these articles come from.
Achieving a high coverage of at least
articles’ metadata is one of the major goals of the EuDML project.

Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented an alternative to the current DML-CZ interface.
Visual
interfaces are more attractive and can help orientation in complex data such as
library records. So far we do experiment with this, targeting at possibility to
include it in the official DML-CZ site and offering it to the EuDML project.
Future work comprises monitoring users’
preferences on interfaces and
their possible feedback.
It
will
probably take some time before users get
accustomed to utilize the visual interface,
since it is far from the traditional
way of browsing. But we hope that users will appreciate the holistic overview
of complex information.
Our immediate plans include working on the design of the search result
interfaces. For this, users’ feedback will be necessary. We also have to test the
RDF Server on the significant loads that are expected within DML-CZ and
EuDML. These conditions seem necessary for usability within any real-world
DML. Working prototype can be seen on
