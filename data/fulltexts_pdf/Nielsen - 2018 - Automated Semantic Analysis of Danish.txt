Why explicit semantic representations?
“When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired
from distributional
semantics (such as word2vec), it provides ap-
plications with understanding that they would not acquire from
distributional
semantics alone,
nor from narrower resources such
as WordNet or DBPedia.
We demonstrate this with state-of-the-
art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that trans-
late into improvements on applications of word vectors, including
solving SAT-style analogies.” — (Speer et al., 2016)

version

not
enable

→ we have no se-

:(
But senses for lexemes are
under
development
and a
test
version is
operational
at

For instance, we can say that the Danish noun spelled as “mandag” has
a sense and that sense denotes the concept described by the Wikidata
beta item Q487758, which is mandag/Monday/Montag.
