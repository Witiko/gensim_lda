ABSTRACT
In this paper, we describe how the hypergeometric test can be used to determine whether a
given theme of interest occurs in a storyset at a frequency more than would be expected by
chance. By a storyset we mean simply a list of stories defined according to a common attribute
(e.g., author, movement, period). The test works roughly as follows: Given a background storyset
and a sub-storyset of interest, the test determines whether a given theme is over-represented
in the sub-storyset,
based on comparing the proportions of
stories in the sub-storyset
and
background storyset featuring the theme. A storyset is said to be “enriched” for a theme with
respect to a particular background storyset, when the theme is identified as being significantly
over-represented by the test. Furthermore, we introduce here a toy dataset consisting of 280
manually themed Star Trek television franchise episodes.
As a proof of concept,
we use the
hypergeometric test to analyze the Star Trek stories for enriched themes. The hypergeometric
testing approach to theme enrichment analysis is implemented for the Star Trek thematic dataset
in the R package

INTRODUCTION
A literary theme, or theme for short, is loosely defined as “An idea that recurs in or pervades a work of art
or literature” (e.g., a story)
1
. Themes are often expressible in a single word or short phrase, as is illustrated
by such garden-variety themes as “love”, “loyalty”, and “the lust for gold”. These examples all happen
to be value-neutral abstractions. But themes can just as well take the form of morally charged messages,
such as “be wary of strangers” and “do not judge prematurely”. The consummate story-maker usually
takes pains to imply a theme indirectly, rather than state it explicitly. Sometimes the story-maker is even
unconscious of important themes found in their stories. A typical story will feature multiple themes. In the
present work, we distinguish between central themes (i.e., themes found to recur throughout a major part
of a story or otherwise important to its conclusion) and peripheral themes (i.e., briefly featured themes that

Theme Enrichment Analysis
are not part of the main story narrative). To sum up: the themes of a story furnish the partaker thereof with
an executive summary of what the story is truly about.
Enrichment (or over-representation) analysis, which amounts to a class of statistical tests, is well-suited
for determining if a given theme of interest is featured more than would be expected by chance in a subset
of stories drawn from a larger set of stories. In particular, the hypergeometric test uses the hypergeometric
distribution to calculate a p-value associated with having drawn at least
k
successes in
n
draws, without
replacement, from a population of size
N
that contains exactly
K
successes. We define a storyset to be a
set of stories defined by some common attribute (e.g., author, movement, period). In the present context,
it is appropriate to think of the population as a background storyset (i.e.,
a set of
N
stories),
and the
sub-population as a test storyset (i.e., a subset of
n ≤ N
background stories). A test storyset is said to be
enriched (or over-represented) for a given theme when the associated hypergeometric test p-value is lower
than a predetermined significance level.
The hypergeometric test
is routinely used in bioinformatical
analyses to identify over-represented
biological terms in lists of genes (Boyle et al., 2004; Zheng and Wang, 2008; Huang et al., 2009). This
differs from the corresponding state of affairs in literary studies. To our knowledge, the hypergeometric test
is yet to be implemented in any of the textual analysis tools in common usage among humanities scholars,
including the Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox (Ramage et al., 2009), TAPoR
2
, TOME (Klein et al.,
2015), Word Seer (Muralidharan et al., 2013), and Voyant Tools

. The same holds true of computer-assisted
qualitative data analysis software that is sometimes used for document analysis in the social sciences

are three such programs that allow users to manage, analyze, and
visualize data related to text, audio, and video documents. However, none of these programs implement the
said test at the time of writing.
In this paper,
we champion the hypergeometric test as a statistically principled approach to theme
enrichment analysis. To this end, we introduce a toy dataset consisting of a total of
280
themed Star Trek
television series episodes. We recorded themes for each of the
80
episodes of Star Trek: The Original
Series (TOS),
22
episodes of Star Trek: The Animated Series (TAS), and
178
episodes of Star Trek: The
Next Generation (TNG); see Supplementary Note 1 for an overview of the Star Trek franchise. What is
more, we hierarchically arranged the collected themes into a draft theme ontology. The Star Trek thematic
dataset paves the way for a demonstration of how the hypergeometric testing approach to enriched theme
identification is helpful for summing up what makes a storyset unique and for generating speculative
hypotheses. We present the results of two case studies as a proof of concept. The first examines how the
portrayal of the Klingons changed from that of a tyrannical and expansionist empire in TOS to an inward
looking warrior culture in TNG. The second explores the most significantly enriched themes for each of
TOS, TAS, and TNG. In short, we find that TOS stands out for its focus on the social issues of the day and
by extension on what constitutes a just and flourishing society, TAS for novel sci-fi and fantasy concepts
especially suited to an animated series, and TNG for its comparatively refined treatment of the human
condition. Moreover, we show that our findings compare favorably with those obtained using the standard
term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach to enrichment analysis (Salton et al.,

Theme Enrichment Analysis
1975), which is commonly implemented in textual analysis software packages. More specifically, we find
that the hypergeometric testing and TF-IDF approaches to enrichment analysis, while agreeing in broad
outlines, exhibit significant differences in terms of the top themes they identify as being enriched. This is
consequential because the hypergeometric test is, by its very definition, the standard according to which
heuristics (i.e.,TF-IDF) ought to be evaluated when it comes to answering the question of whether a theme
is enriched in a storyset of interest.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce our aforementioned draft theme
ontology. It is a hierarchically organized theme vocabulary, partitioned into the following four domains: the
human condition, society, the pursuit of knowledge, and alternate reality. There are
1535
unique themes in
total. Criteria and guidelines motivating our hierarchical arrangement are discussed. In Section 3 we explain
the hypergeometric testing approach to theme enrichment analysis in full technical detail. In Section 4 we
use the hypergeometric test to identify enriched themes in the two Star Trek case studies outlined above.
These results we compare with those obtained using the standard TF-IDF approach to enrichment analysis.
We conclude the paper in Section 5 with a summary of our main contributions,
a discussion of some
limitations of our methodology, and go on to describe a handful of possible future directions. Most notably,
in terms of limitations, we emphasize that we manually tagged stories with themes, and as a consequence
the findings we report inevitably reflect our point of view, and are not fully replicable. An overview of
Star Trek film and television series franchise is found in Supplementary Note 1. A list of episodes used in
the Klingon theme enrichment case study is found in Supplementary Note 2. The results of the TF-IDF
approach to theme enrichment analysis are presented in Supplementary Note 3. The theme enrichment
analysis procedure based on the hypergeometric test is implemented in the

A THEME ONTOLOGY
A theme ontology is a controlled vocabulary of defined terms representing literary themes in fiction. In this
section, we introduce a draft theme ontology covering all TOS, TAS, and TNG Star Trek television series
episodes, of which there are
280
. The ontology consists of
1535
unique themes arranged into the following
four domains:
The Human Condition [
]:
Themes pertaining to “characteristics, key events, and situations which
compose the essentials of human existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and
mortality”
10
.
Society [
]:
Themes pertaining to a “community of people living in a particular country or region and
having shared customs, laws, and organizations”
11
.
The Pursuit of Knowledge [
]:
Themes pertaining to “facts, information, and skills acquired through
experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject”

Theme Enrichment Analysis
Alternate Reality [
]:
Themes related to subject matter falling outside of reality as it is presently
understood. These are classical science fiction and fantasy themes
13
.
Figure 1 shows a bird’s eye view of the ontology. The abstract theme “literary thematic entity” is taken
as root theme. Each domain is structured as a tree descended from the root with “the human condition”,
“society”, “the pursuit of knowledge”, and “alternate reality” serving as the top themes of their respective
domains. Each child theme is made to bear a subtype relationship with its parent. In the figure, the ontology
tree structure is depicted to a height of three levels, although in reality it branches out a number levels
further still, as summarized along with other information in Table 1.
In designing the ontology,
we strive to define sibling themes so as to be mutually exclusive,
but not
necessarily jointly exhaustive. All non-root themes are accompanied by short definitions in an effort to
make their range of applicability plain. We appeal to the principle of refutability as an anodyne to vagueness
in definition writing. In other words, an acceptably defined theme will be such that there is the possibility of
appealing to the definition to show that the associated theme is not featured in a story. Take “to tell the truth
vs. offering a comforting lie” as an example, which is defined as “A character must choose between telling
a comforting white lie on one hand, and being honest on the other.”. We contend that definition writing
of this sort helps to bring the conversation of whether a theme is featured in a given story into the realm
of rational argumentation. The theme ontology dataset has been made accessible in a structured manner
through the
R
package
stoRy
(Sheridan and Onsj
¨
o, 2017). This paper uses version 0.1.1 of the ontology,
which can be accessed through the analogously numbered
stoRy
package 0.1.1. Functions for exploring the
ontology are described in the package reference manual. For example, the command
theme$print()
prints summary information for the theme object
theme
, and the function
print tree
takes a theme
object as input and prints the corresponding theme together with its descendants in tree format to the
console. We encourage non-R-users to explore the latest version of the ontology on the Theme Ontology
website
14
. Previous versions of the ontology have been made available for download there.
It is crucial to bear in mind that the theme ontology is wholly separable from the Star Trek television
series franchise.
Many of the themes populating the ontology are sufficiently universal in scope to be
helpful in the recording of themes for of almost any work of fiction. That said, we availed ourselves of
these themes in the recording of themes for
280
Star Trek television series episodes. We assigned central
and peripheral themes for each episode. Note that centrality and peripherality are to be understood not as
properties of a theme, but rather as relations between a theme and a story. Thus, it is perfectly fine for a
given theme to be central to one story and peripheral to another. A theme is said to be observed in a story
when it is featured in such a way that none of its descendent themes are also featured. An ancestor of an
observed theme in a story is said to be a latent theme. Table 2 shows a basic statistical summary of the
thematic data by series. Summary statistics for observed themes in are shown in the upper part of the table,
and observed and latent themes in the lower part.
Take the TOS episode The Devil in the Dark (1967) as an example.
In the story,
the starship USS
Enterprise is dispatched to investigate rumors of a subterranean creature that is thought to be responsible
for the destruction of equipment and the deaths of fifty men on the Janus VI mining colony. Captain James
T. Kirk and First Officer Spock discover a hideous “silicon-based life form” inhabiting the surrounding
bedrock. The mother Horta, as the creature comes to be known, is an “endangered species” – the last of its
kind. Kirk is faced with a “tough decision” as the creature seemingly blocks the miners path to wealth:

either commit genocide or forego plundering the mother Horta’s natural resources. But Spock fortuitously
manages to achieve a “cross cultural understanding” with the creature by means of a Vulcan mind-meld.
An unsettling compromise is reached when the mother Horta agrees to help the miners locate ore deposits
in the rock in exchange for a cessation of hostilities. The attentive viewer will note, from the creature’s
perspective, an “attack from outer space by a powerful conquering alien race” (a.k.a. “alien invasion”)
with overtones of “the morality of colonization” by the episode’s conclusion. This summarizes some of
the more salient central story themes, as recorded by the authors. The proverb “beauty is in the eye of the
beholder” is a noteworthy peripheral theme. Indeed, Spock learned, in the course of the mind-meld, that
the human form is just as repellant to the mother Horta, as her appearance is to humans.
We tagged each of the
280
episodes of TOS, TAS, and TNG with themes in a similar manner. The process
according to which we assigned themes can be summed up as follows. We independently tagged episodes
with themes and then compared notes with a view toward building a consensus set of themes for each
episode. We aimed to abide in the principle of low-hanging fruit in the compilation of consensus themes. In
the present context, this means we tried to ensure that at least the most salient topics featured in the episodes
are covered by appropriate themes. Another principle guiding our thought process is the minimization of
false positives (i.e., the tagging of episodes with themes that are not featured) at the expense of tolerating
false negatives (i.e., neglecting to tag episodes with themes that they feature). This strategy amounts to
erring on the side of caution. We fully acknowledge that this process lacks safeguards against the tagging
of stories with themes that are idiosyncratic and unique to our point of view. We will return to this subject
in the discussion section.

THEME ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS
This section is devoted to an exposition on the hypergeometric testing approach to theme enrichment
analysis. The test uses the p-value obtained from the hypergeometric cumulative distribution

to answer the question of whether a given theme occurs in a test storyset at a frequency significantly greater
than would be expected by chance alone. In the equation,
n
is the size of the test storyset,
k
is the number
of stories in the test storyset featuring the theme,
N
is the size of the background storyset, and
K
is the
number of stories in the background storyset featuring the theme. The
K
background stories featuring
the theme determine what we will call the theme storyset. Figure 2 depicts the testing framework in Venn
diagrammatic form. The value of
P (k, n, K, N )
is the probability of observing at least
k
stories featuring a
given theme in a test storyset of size
n
that is composed of stories drawn at random, without replacement,
from the background storyset. As we explained in the introduction, a theme is deemed to be enriched in
a test storyset with respect to a background storyset if its p-value is less than a preselected significance
level, alpha. Whether the test storyset is found to be enriched for a given theme or not will necessarily
depend on the choice of background storyset.
The hypergeometric testing procedure is silent on the matter of theme, test storyset, and background
storyset selection.
It falls on the investigator to first pose an interesting question,
and then choose the
hypergeometric test input storysets accordingly. In the previous section, we proposed that the TOS episode
The Devil in the Dark (1967) featured an “alien invasion”. Indeed, the theme has long been a favorite among
sci-fi writers. More generally, the sci-fi genre has proven to be particularly well-suited to the exploration of

“existential risks” (i.e., manners by which civilization on a planetary scale and beyond could come into
jeopardy), of which “alien invasion” is but one, albeit far-fetched, example. It is easy to imagine a fictitious
investigator who wishes to assess whether “existential risk” (theme) is enriched in TOS (test storyset) with
respect to all of TOS, TAS, and TNG (background storyset). This casts the question “Does TOS stand out
among Gene Roddenberry produced Star Trek television series for its featuring of existential risks?” in
precise enough terms to be made amenable to theme enrichment analysis. As we will see in Section 4.2,
the test results in a p-value of
0.0002
, so that we may conclude the theme “existential risk” is enriched in
TOS at significance level alpha equal to
0.05

In practice,
the curious investigator will often wish to check whether each theme in an ontology is
significantly enriched in a given test storyset relative to some background storyset. This raises the specter of
multiple comparisons (Noble, 2009; Meijer and Goeman, 2016; McDonald, 2014). To illustrate the matter,
recall that the p-value in a hypothesis test is the probability of getting a result at least as extreme as the
observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A p-value calculated to be less than the investigator’s
desired significance level, alpha, is interpreted as evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The value
7
Onsj
¨
o and Sheridan
Theme Enrichment Analysis
of alpha sets an upper limit on the chance of making a false positive discovery that the investigator is
willing to tolerate. Consider, for example, the classroom problem of testing whether a given coin is fair or
biased. The conventional null and alternative hypotheses are that the coin is fair and biased, respectively.
Choosing an alpha of
0.05
translates into a
1
in
20
chance of concluding that the hypothetical coin in
question is biased when it is actually fair (i.e., the null hypothesis is rejected when it is true). In the case
when a large number hypothesis tests are conducted, chance dictates that some definite proportion of the
p-values obtained will be less than alpha, even when the truth of all the null hypotheses is assured. For
example, suppose
1535
fair coins are individually tested in the above manner. This is as many coins as
there are themes in our ontology. If all
1535
coins are tested at an alpha of
0.05
, then the expected number
of fair coins mistakenly identified as biased ones works out to be
0.05 × 1535 ≈ 77
. The aim of multiple
comparison correction procedures is to limit the number of false positives. The Bonferroni correction and
the false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001) are the two most
common procedures. However, it is inappropriate to correct for multiple comparisons in the context of
testing for multiple enriched themes. This is because a given theme is either over-represented in a test
storyset relative to a background or it is not. If a theme is significantly enriched at a given significance
level, then it is a true positive by definition. Therefore it would be misguided to apply the sorts of standard
correction procedures that are used in biology in the context of testing list of genes for enriched terms. For
this reason, we refrain from correcting the p-values calculated in this paper for multiple comparisons.

A STUDY OF ENRICHED THEMES IN STAR TREK
In this section,
we present
two cases studies of theme enrichment
analysis applied to the Star Trek
television franchise. As we explained in the introduction, the first examines how the Klingons changed
from a tyrannical and expansionist empire in TOS to an inward looking warrior culture in TNG. The second,
also described in the introduction, takes an in-depth look into significantly enriched themes by series. In
short, we find that TOS stands out for its treatment of what constitutes a good society and how one is to lead
a good life within it, TAS for novel alien and sci-fi concepts appropriate to an animated series, and TNG for
its comparatively refined treatment of the human condition. The message we wish to convey based on these
case studies is that theme enrichment analysis is helpful when it comes to both the summarization what
makes a storyset unique and the formulation of speculative hypotheses. Note that we include both central
and peripheral themes in the analyses.
In addition,
we present the reassuring results of some negative
control experiments, and compare the TF-IDF approach to enrichment with the results of our case studies.
The theme enrichment analyses are easily replicated using version
0.1.1
of the stoRy package.

Theme Enrichment Analysis
4.1
A Tale of Two Klingons
The Klingons are an
¨
uber-belligerent humanoid species in the Star Trek alien pantheon. In TOS, the
Klingon Empire is made to pursue a harsh imperialist foreign policy, characterized by the unapologetic use
of military force in the subjugation of their weaker neighbors. The Federation, by contrast, is portrayed as
a group of confederated alien races, united under the common principles of human rights, equality, and
interstellar cooperation. In the series, the Federation fights to check Klingon expansion in the galaxy. The
conflict between the Federation and the Klingon Empire in TOS is commonly understood as an allegory for
the Cold War (Cantor, 2000). According to this interpretation, the Federation represents the Western powers,
and the Klingon Empire represents the Soviet Union; both as seen from a more or less contemporaneous
American point of view.
But by TNG,
Klingon society had undergone a radical transformation.
The
Klingons changed from being an avowed Federation enemy hell-bent on galactic domination to a loose
Federation ally with a warrior culture preoccupied with internal struggle and the maintaining of cherished
traditions in a changing world (Knight and Smith, 1998). The changing face Klingon society has been
examined in much detail in books (Taylor, 2002; Gonzalez, 2015; Telotte, 2008), academic papers (Knight
and Smith, 1998; Cantor, 2000), and scattered online sources
15 16 17
.
In this case study, we use the Klingons as a positive control to demonstrate that our approach to theme
enrichment analysis is able to distinguish the imperialist Klingons of TOS from the warrior culture ones of
TNG. To this end, we curated a storyset consisting of all
26
Klingon-centric TOS, TAS, and TNG episodes;
see Supplementary Note 2 for a complete episode listing. The criterion for episode inclusion is that the
Klingons were deemed by the authors to have been featured throughout the episode in a way that is central
to the story. We performed two theme enrichment analyses: 1) the test storyset of TOS/TAS Klingon-centric
episodes against a background of all TOS/TAS episodes,
2) the test storyset of TNG Klingon-centric
episodes against a background of all TNG episodes. The TOS and TAS episodes we pooled because TAS is
conventionally considered to be a continuation of TOS. The TOS/TAS and TNG test storysets consist of
n = 8
and
n = 18
episodes, respectively. In each experiment, we calculated an enrichment score, that is, a
hypergeometric test p-value, for each of the
1535
themes present in the ontology.
The test identified
27
and
22

Table 3 shows the top

We focus on
interpreting the enriched themes shown in the table, but we note that the excluded ones are consistent with
the interpretation we advance. With that caveat aside, an inspection of Table 3 shows that our positive
control test results are interpretable in a manner that is in keeping with expectation. Consider first those
themes from the society domain. TOS/TAS Klingon “imperialistic society” posed a serious military threat
to the Federation. When an inevitable “transnational social issue” flared up between the Federation and
Klingon Empire, such as a “conflict over a shared resource”, the resolution usually came about by either
“diplomatic negotiating” or outright “war”. Although in rare instances, Klingons and Federation members
came to a “cross cultural understanding” when united by a common enemy. But TOS/TAS Klingon society
had at its heart a “conflict of moral codes” with Federation ideology that proved insuperable.
Where
TOS/TAS Klingon society is enterprising and enthusiastic in its convictions, TNG Klingon society is inward

Theme Enrichment Analysis
looking and gloomy. The society themes enriched in TNG Klingon episodes pertain to internal conflicts, as
evidenced by the themes “racism in society”, “religious fanaticism”, and “war of succession”. No longer is
the Klingon Empire striving to impose Klingon values on the galaxy by means of military force, but rather
it is focused on its own internal affairs. This brings us to the human condition. In TOS/TAS, the human
condition domain themes are almost all virtues possessed by the aliens that the Klingons conquered (i.e.,
“pacifism”, “humility”, “patience”, and “temperance”). On the other hand, the human condition domain
themes enriched in TNG (i.e., “honor”, “rage”, and “loyalty”) are all signature TNG Klingon characteristics.
Notice, by contrast, that “honor” is nowhere to be found among the top
20
significantly enriched TOS/TAS
Klingon themes. In fact, it occurs as the
101
st ranked theme with a p-value of
0.219
. What is more, in
the one episode in which it was featured – Friday’s Child (1967) – it pertained not to the Klingons, but to
their enemy the Capellans. A number of the human condition themes pertain to Worf trying to maintain
his Klingon culture in a Human world
18
. The themes “the need for cultural heritage” and “belonging” are
two noteworthy examples. Other human condition themes surround aspects of life in a cut-throat warrior
culture, like “the lust for power” and “the desire for redemption”. Finally, it is pleasant to note that Klingon
“
¨
uber-belligerence” and a passion for “the art of war” shine through in both cases.
4.2
A Tale of Three Series
We used the test to identify enriched themes in TOS (
120
themes), TAS (
6
themes), and TNG (
46
themes)
at significance level
0.05
. The background storyset in each case consists of the episodes from all the series
combined. Here we report the outcomes of the analyses and show how they can aid in the generation of
speculative hypotheses. In keeping with the Klingon case study from the previous subsection, we frame our
hypotheses about TOS and TNG in terms of the top
20
most enriched themes for each respective series.
This, we contend, is enough to convey the merits of our methodology without burdening the reader with
protracted syntheses of long lists of enriched themes, however pleasant an exercise the formulation of such
syntheses might be for the authors. On the other hand, we take some leeway and extend our analysis of TAS
to the top
10
most enriched themes. But we note that our general conclusions would remain unchanged had
we limited our interpretations to the
6
enriched themes at significance level
0.05
. Tables containing the
full results from these analyses are included in Supplementary Information File 2. Star Trek enthusiasts
will find few surprises in the kinds of themes that are shown to distinguish the respective series. To the
layperson, however, the results of Table 4 may be unexpected and serve as a useful point of departure for
exploring the series. The stacked percentage bar plots of Figure 3 show a broad pattern of human condition
domain themes being enriched in TNG, alternate reality domain themes in TAS, and society domain themes
in TOS to some degree. The associated matrix scatterplot hints at some interesting enriched theme domain
correlations between series. But let us proceed to inspect and compare more specific themes in order to
gain a more nuanced understanding of the series.
TOS: The two society domain themes “female stereotype” and “gender issues” stand out as they relate
to the role of women in
1960
s society. The former is indicative of what Karen Blair and R. P. M. have
described as a tendency in TOS to portray females in such a manner as to “affirm traditional male fantasies
in a most direct and unenlightened way” (Blair and R. M. P., 1983). The latter, however, is in keeping with
another line of scholarly thought that contends TOS made some positive contributions to the advancement
of women in society (Ferguson et al., 1997; Vettel-Becker, 2014). Three of the seven enriched alternate
reality domain themes (i.e., “alternate society”, “existential risk”, and “man-made existential risk”) confront
viewers with ideas about how society could be changed for better or worse. In particular, the emphasis on
18
Worf, a main character in the TNG series, is the lone Klingon crew member aboard the Enterprise-D starship.
10

Theme Enrichment Analysis
existential risks is likely a reflection of the Cold War and relatively fresh memories of the Second World
War (Cantor, 2000). In light of this, it is interesting to note that five of the most enriched human condition
domain themes (i.e., “wrath”, “facing a fight to the death”, “rage”, “unpleasant emotion”, and “disagreeable
characteristic”) are also closely tied to conflict. The remaining human condition domain themes (i.e., “way
of life”, “purpose in life”, “personal ethical dilemma”, “tough decision”, and “the need for a challenge in
life”) pertain to life choices and decision making. Speculating about why this might be a feature of TOS
relative to the later series is left to the reader. Suffice it to say that they, like all the most enriched human
condition domain themes in TOS, are notably different from the most enriched themes in TNG.
TAS: Seven of the ten most enriched themes can be labeled simply as fanciful notions. Four are typical
sci-fi themes: “earth-life inspired life form”, “life-support belt”, “miscellaneous life form”, and “what
if my life were different”. The remaining two themes “Chariots of the Gods” and “Atlantis” refer to the
“crackpot theories” that aliens made contact with humans in ancient times and Atlantis was a civilization
with advanced technology, respectively. That such themes are enriched in TAS can be explained by the
fact that it is the only animated series of the trio. This would have released the authors from constraints
otherwise imposed by the need for costly props and special effects (see Table 4 for some examples) and
allowed them to further unleash their imagination. We hypothesize the lack of emotion-related themes
may be partially explained by early animation technology’s inability to approach the nuances of facial
expression and body language that the consummate actors of TOS and TNG, such as William Shatner and
Patrick Stewart, would routinely employ.
TNG: Nearly all of the
20
most enriched TNG themes relate to individual human experience.
About
half of them are descendants of the themes “family affairs”:
“familial love”,
“growing up”,
“mother
and son”,
“maternal love”,
“adolescence”,
“familial relations”,
“father and son”,
“paternal love”,
and
“child rearing”. The others are not dissimilar: “human emotion”, “heavenly virtue”, “human personality”,
“social interaction”, “pride”, “belonging”, and “introspection”. Anyone familiar with the android Data
will recognize that the themes “android” and “AI point of view” relate to stories about individual human
experience as well. One theme that stands out for not falling under the human condition is “virtual reality
room”, a particular sci-fi concept that refers to the holodeck in TNG, which has become something of
a meme in its own right. Why it is that TNG so distinctly features these family affair, relationship, and
emotional themes is of course open to interpretation. We speculatively hypothesize that an inexorable trend
in modern television has been towards vapid character development designed to evoke safe familiarity
rather than intellectual stimulus or moral controversy. Be that as it may, it is safe to say that the main
characters in TNG have more elaborate background stories,
subtle personality traits,
and complicated
interpersonal relationships than the main characters of the two earlier series.
4.3
Negative Control Experiments
We performed a series of negative control experiments. In one such experiment, we performed enrichment
analyses for
1000
test storysets consisting of
n = 8
randomly selected TOS/TAS episodes against the
same background. This mirrors the TOS/TAS Klingon positive control settings. The average number of
significantly enriched themes was
10±5
at significance level
α = 0.05
. The corresponding Klingon storyset
has
28
significantly enriched themes at the same significance level. This is noticeably more enriched themes
on average than would be expected by chance. In a similar negative control with
n = 18
for the test storyset,
we found the average number of significantly enriched themes to be
13 ± 5
relative to a background of
all TNG episodes. The corresponding Klingon storyset has
22
significantly enriched themes. Again this is
more than would be expected to be enriched by chance.

Hypergeometric Test and TF-IDF Comparison
TF-IDF is a statistic that is used in data mining to measure the importance of a word in a document in a
collection of documents (Rajaraman and Ullman, 2011). It is implemented in such textual analysis tools as
the Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox (Ramage et al., 2009), TAPoR
19
, TOME (Klein et al., 2015), Word
Seer (Muralidharan et al., 2013), and Voyant Tools
20
. In this subsection, we take a TF-IDF approach to the
identification of enriched themes in the Klingon and series case studies, and compare the results with those
obtained using the hypergeometric test. We implemented the TF-IDF formula
−k/n × log(K/N)
, where
k/n
is the term frequency,
and
− log(K/N)
is the logarithmically scaled inverse document frequency.
Table S2 contains the top
20
TF-IDF scoring themes in TOS/TAS Klingon and TNG Klingon episodes.
Table S3 contains the analogous results for the individual series TOS, TAS, and TNG. For Tables S2-S3, refer
to Supplementary Note 3. The results significantly overlap with those obtained using the hypergeometric
test. For the Klingons of TOS/TAS a remarkable
20
out of the top
20
themes are held in common (it turns
out to be
38
out of the top
50
),
and for the Klingons of TNG the figure amounts to
14
out of
20
.
The
numbers for the individual series TOS, TAS, and TNG are
12/20
,
6/10
, and
8/20
, respectively. What is
more, the scatterplots of Figure S2 show broad correlation between TF-IDF scores and hypergeometric
test logarithmically scaled p-values. What we take from this is that TF-IDF and the hypergeometric test
approaches agree in their broad outlines, but differ in the details. Based on these outcomes, we contend that
elucidating the mathematical relationship between TF-IDF and the hypergeometric test would make for an
interesting future work. For the present, we merely point out that one advantage of the hypergeometric
test is that the p-values obtained therefrom are, on the face of it, more amenable to interpretation than
TF-IDF scores. To be specific, the p-value of a theme is interpretable as the probability of drawing a sample
consisting of at least
k
stories that feature the theme in
n
draws, without replacement, from a background
of
N
stories of which exactly
K
feature the theme.
By contrast,
the search for a simple probabilistic
interpretation of TF-IDF scores remains a subject of ongoing research (Sparck Jones, 1988; Robertson,
2004; Havrlant and Kreinovich, 2017).

DISCUSSION
The primary aim of this paper has been to introduce the hypergoemetric test for theme enrichment analysis
to the digital humanities community. We consider our proposed draft theme ontology and toy Star Trek
thematic dataset to be contributions of a secondary nature. The hypergeometric testing approach to the
identification of enriched themes in a list of stories equips the digital humanist with a new weapon to wield
in their document analyses. We have demonstrated the potential of the hypergeometric test by applying
it to Star Trek television franchise thematic data. In the first place, we found the lists of enriched themes
produced by the test to be helpful for identifying what makes the corresponding storysets special and for
generating speculative hypotheses. In the second place, we argued that the hypergeometric test compares
favorably with the commonly used TF-IDF statistic when it comes to answering the question of whether
such-and-such a theme (or any term for that matter) occurs in a storyset at a frequency significantly greater
than would be expected by chance. But we would be remiss not to touch on the potential for “garbage
in, garbage out” (GIGO) to bias and confound theme enrichment analyses. In other words, the result of a
theme enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test is at best as good as the themes on which it is
based. The GIGO menace warrants special mention in the context of thematic analyses. The reason is that
themes, unlike objective scientific entities such as genes, are generally complex abstractions of a highly

test to thematic data. All that said, it is our hope that this work will contribute to the judicious use of the
hypergeometric test in the digital humanities in the fullness of time.
Two main obstacles stand in the way of making theme enrichment analysis practical on a large-scale.
First, a protocol for tagging stories with themes in such a manner that stories can be meaningfully compared
in terms of their shared themes must be developed.
We have taken a first step toward addressing this
need by proposing a draft theme ontology.
Moving forward,
we aim to make the ontology compliant
with Basic Formal Ontology design best practices (Arp et al., 2015). This includes the incorporating of
related ontologies such as the Emotion Ontology (Hastings et al., 2011) to name but one. Ontology design
is an open-ended process, subject to setbacks and changes of direction. It is plain that our draft theme

ontology will be no exception. However, we point out that even if the structure of the ontology changes
markedly, many of the themes will remain intact as presently defined. Second, a large-scale database of
compatibly themed stories is required. To this end, we have launched the Theme Ontology (beta version)
14
Onsj

online community platform
21
. The website features an ever-expanding controlled vocabulary of defined
themes, hierarchically arranged into our draft theme ontology. Community members are encouraged to
tag whatever stories (e.g.,
short stories,
novels,
films,
TV shows,
etc.) they please with themes drawn
from the ontology, and adorn the ontology with newly coined themes as necessary. Stories are manually
tagged with themes at present. Topic modeling techniques (Blei, 2012) as implemented in such software
packages as MALLET
22
, the Python module gensim (
ˇ
Reh
˚
u
ˇ
rek and Sojka, 2010),
topicmodels (Gr
¨
un
and Hornik, 2011), and the
R
package
tm
(Feinerer et al., 2008) have been used successfully to identify
literary themes in text copora (Jockers, 2013; Jockers and Mimno, 2013; Goldstone and Underwood, 2014;
Boyd-Graber et al., 2017). In the future, we plan to use topic modeling to automatically collect themes for
large numbers of stories in order to grow the Theme Ontology database. An interesting challenge awaits
in figuring out how to adapt the current methods for automatic topic labeling (Lau et al., 2011; Basave
et al., 2014; Bhatia et al., 2017) to the problem of mapping identified topics to themes in the ontology.
Lastly, a theme enrichment analyzer web application is available for download at the Theme Ontology
GitHub repository at
https://github.com/theme-ontology/shiny-apps
.
Tools from the
the
stoRy
package, including our theme enrichment test, will be made accessible as web applications on
the Theme Ontology website in order to help users analyze curated thematic datasets. It is our aim to build
up a large-scale database of freely available themed stories that can be analyzed using web applications via
this story theming system.
On the identification of themes in stories, something must be said. We emphasize that our tagging of
Star Trek television series episodes with themes in this paper was manual, subjective to our point of view,
and not fully replicable. In general, theme identification is admittedly subjective, but this is not to say the
endeavor is altogether arbitrary. The Oxford Dictionaries definition of theme quoted in the introduction,
which proves adequate for most literary-critical purposes, is problematic from the present point of view
insofar as it designates a theme to be a property of a story. Instead, we propose to consider a theme as a
relation between story and partaker thereof. According to this subjective view, it is entirely possible for
partaker A to contend that theme X is featured in story Y, but not partaker B. Objectivity is approached to
the extent that universal agreement among story partakers is attained. The potential for a system of this
kind to degenerate into a wasteland of subjectivity depends on the extent to which themes can be made
precise. At the Theme Ontology community platform, we are presently drafting a policies and guidelines
document that will emphasize the need for clarity in and verifiability of theme definitions. The theme “the
desire for vengeance”, which is defined as “A character seeks vengeance over a perceived injury or wrong.”,
constitutes a model definition. Growing pains are inevitable. But by concentrating on cataloging precisely
defined and verifiable themes, i.e., the low-hanging fruit, we hope to ensure that Theme Ontology becomes
a useful literary studies resource in the future.
There are a few points to mention in closing. First, the toy thematic dataset we have introduced in the
present work consists of the combined
280
episodes of TOS, TAS, and TNG. We contend this sufficed for
our purpose of demonstrating the value of theme enrichment analysis. But there entire Star Trek franchise
is made up of
740
episodes and films. A good future work would be to round out the toy dataset with
themed episodes from all the other series along with the films. Second, the hypergeometric test is designed
to answer the question: what themes in a test storyset of interest stand out against a background storyset.
But other interesting literary questions are also amenable to statistical investigation.

investigator may wish to discover a subset of stories in a storyset that have similar themes by performing
a clustering analysis. Another example is time-series analysis for the study of how theme usage changes
over time in a storyset with timestamped stories. In the future, the

include statistical methods to address questions of these sorts. Lastly, computer-assisted qualitative data

VERBI Software (1989-2017). MAXQDA, software for qualitative data analysis. are three such programs that allow users to manage, analyze, and visualize
data related to text, audio, and video documents. It is possible to use these sorts of programs to annotate stories with themes and subsequently explore the
correlations among them. However, to our knowledge, none of these programs implement the hypergeometric test. The same thing holds for the popular textual
analysis tools the Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox (Ramage et al., 2009), TAPoR
26
, TOME (Klein et al., 2015), Word Seer (Muralidharan et al., 2013), and
Voyant Tools
