Abstract
In recent years, topic modeling has become an established method in the analysis of text corpora, with probabilistic techniques
such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) commonly employed for this purpose. However, it might be argued that enough attention
is often not paid to the issue of topic coherence, the semantic interpretability of the top terms usually used to describe discovered
topics.
Nevertheless,
a number of studies have proposed measures for analyzing such coherence,
where these have been largely
focused on topics found by LDA, with matrix decomposition techniques such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) being
somewhat overlooked in comparison.
This motivates the current work,
where we compare and analyze topics found by popular
variants of both NMF and LDA in multiple corpora in terms of both their coherence and associated generality, using a combination
of existing and new measures,
including a distributional semantics measure based on an algorithm provided by the increasingly
popular word2vec tool.
Two out of three coherence measures find NMF to regularly produce more coherent topics,
with higher
levels of generality and redundancy observed with the LDA topic descriptors.
In all
cases,
it
appears that
the associated term
weighting strategy plays a major role.
The results observed with NMF suggest that this may be a more suitable topic modeling
method when analyzing certain corpora, such as those associated with niche or non-mainstream domains.

Introduction
Topic modeling is a key tool
for the discovery of latent
semantic structure within a variety of
document
collections,
where probabilistic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA) have effectively become the de facto standard method
employed (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003).
The discovered topics
are usually described using their corresponding top
N
highest-
ranking terms,
for example,
the top 10 most
probable terms
from an LDA
φ
topic distribution over terms.
In the case of
probabilistic topic models, a number of metrics are used to eval-
uate model fit, such as perplexity or held-out likelihood (Wal-
lach, Murray, Salakhutdinov, and Mimno, 2009b).
At the same
time,
it might be argued that less attention is paid to the issue
of topic coherence, or the semantic interpretability of the terms
used to describe a particular topic, despite the observation that
evaluation methods such as perplexity are often not correlated
with human judgements of topic quality (Chang, Boyd-Graber,
Gerrish,
Wang,
and Blei,
2009).
However,
a number of mea-
sures have been proposed in recent years for the measurement
of coherence, based on approaches that include co-occurrence
frequencies of terms within a reference corpus (Newman, Lau,
Grieser, and Baldwin, 2010; Mimno, Wallach, Talley, Leenders,
and McCallum, 2011; Lau, Newman, and Baldwin, 2014) and

distributional semantics (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013). The in-
tuition is that pairs of topic descriptor terms that co-occur fre-
quently or are close to each other within a semantic space are
likely to contribute to higher levels of coherence.
Non-probabilistic methods based on matrix decomposition
are also used for topic modeling, such as Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis (LSA) (Deerwester, Dumais, Landauer, Furnas, and Harsh-
man, 1990) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee
and Seung, 1999; Arora,
Ge,
and Moitra, 2012b).
Here,
topic
term descriptors can be generated in a similar fashion to those
of probabilistic models, for example, using the top
N
highest-
ranked terms from an NMF topic basis vector.
In our previ-
ous work, we generated topics using both LDA and NMF with
two particular corpora, where a qualitative analysis of the corre-
sponding term descriptors found the most readily-interpretable
topics to be discovered by NMF (O’Callaghan,
Greene,
Con-
way,
Carthy,
and Cunningham,
2013).
An example of the is-
sues we encountered can be illustrated with the following topics
that were discovered by LDA and NMF for the same value of
k
within a corpus of online news articles (described in further
detail in Section 5):
•
LDA: iran,
syria,
syrian,
iraq,
weapon,
president,
war,
nuclear, military, iranian
•
NMF: syria, syrian, weapon, chemical, assad, damascus,
rebel, military, opposition, lebanon
At
a glance,
both topics appear both relevant
and coher-
ent, with no identifiable irrelevant terms, where the topics may
Preprint submitted to Expert Systems with Applications

be interpreted as being associated with the ongoing Syria con-
flict.
A closer inspection of the terms suggests that the LDA
topic is in fact a general topic about the Middle East, while the
NMF topic is far more specifically concerned with Syria (in-
cluding the lebanon term in this context), which could also be
interpreted as being more coherent depending on the end user’s
expectations.
This issue regarding the possibility for LDA to
over-generalize has been raised previously by Chemudugunta,
Smyth,
and Steyvers (2006).
However,
a study by Stevens,
Kegelmeyer, Andrzejewski, and Buttler (2012) of the coherence
of topics discovered by LSA,
NMF and LDA within a single
corpus composed of online New York Times articles from 2003
(Sandhaus, 2008), concluded that NMF produced the more in-
coherent topics.
As our previous findings suggest that this is-
sue is unresolved, we perform an evaluation of LDA and NMF
using a range of corpora,
where our two major objectives are
the measurement and comparison of 1) topic coherence, and 2)
topic generality.
The latter is considered at two levels; the ten-
dency for a method to generate topics containing high-frequency
descriptor terms from the underlying corpus,
and also the ap-
pearance of terms in multiple descriptors for a particular model,
signifying the presence of overlap or dependence between the
topics.
To this end, we compiled six new and existing corpora con-
taining documents that had been (manually) annotated with cla-
sses, including online news articles from the BBC, the Guardian,
and the New York Times, in addition to Wikipedia project page
content.
A consistent set of pre-processing steps was applied
to these,
and topics were discovered with LDA and NMF. Al-
though multiple variants exist
for both topic modeling meth-
ods,
we restricted the experiments to those that
appear to be
commonly used,
with popular implementations being run ac-
cordingly (McCallum, 2002; Pedregosa, Varoquaux, Gramfort,
Michel, Thirion, Grisel, Blondel, Prettenhofer, Weiss, Dubourg,
Vanderplas,
Passos,
Cournapeau,
Brucher,
Perrot,
and Duch-
esnay,
2011),
in addition to recommended parameter values
(Steyvers and Griffiths, 2006). Two out of three coherence mea-
sures,
including a new measure based on word2vec (Mikolov,
Chen,
Corrado,
and Dean,
2013a) term vector similarity,
find
NMF to regularly produce more coherent topics,
while higher
levels of generality and redundancy are observed with the LDA
topic descriptors.
However, it appears that the associated term
weighting strategy plays a major role, as modifications to both
document term pre-processing (NMF) and descriptor term post-
processing (LDA) can produce markedly different results. Sep-
arately, we also find that LDA produces more accurate document-
topic memberships when compared with the original class an-
notations.

Topic Modeling
Topic modeling is concerned with the discovery of latent se-
mantic structure or topics within a set of documents, which can
be derived from co-occurrences of words in documents (Steyvers
and Griffiths, 2006).
This strategy dates back to the early work

on latent semantic indexing by Deerwester, Dumais, Landauer,
Furnas,
and Harshman (1990),
which proposed the decompo-
sition of term-document
matrices for this purpose using Sin-
gular Value Decomposition.
Probabilistic topic models have
become popular in recent years,
having been introduced with
the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) method of
Hofmann (2001),
also known as Probabilistic Latent
Seman-
tic Indexing (PLSI).
Here,
a topic is a probability distribution
over words, with documents being mixtures of topics, thus per-
mitting a topic model to be considered a generative model for
documents (Steyvers and Griffiths,
2006).
With this process,
a document is generated by first sampling a topic
z
from the
document-topic distribution
θ
, followed by a word
w
from the
corresponding topic-word distribution
φ
.
The extension of this
model by Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003), known as latent Dirich-
let allocation (LDA), suggested using a Dirichlet prior on
θ
with
an associated hyperparameter
α
.
Griffiths and Steyvers (2004)
proposed also using a Dirichlet
prior on
φ
,
with correspond-
ing hyperparameter
β
. The plate notation for this model can be
found in Figure 1.
Griffiths and Steyvers (2004) also used collapsed Gibbs sam-
pling to indirectly estimate these distributions, by iteratively es-
timating the probability of assigning each word to the topics,
conditioned on the current topic assignments of all other words,
using count matrices of topic-word (
C

) and document-topic
(

) assignments:

There have been a number of additional
variants of LDA
proposed in recent years. However, in this paper, we are primar-
ily concerned with the coherence of topic modeling in general,
and so the discussion here is accordingly restricted to a) popular
LDA variants, and b) those used by the topic coherence exper-
iments described in Section 2.2.
Two popular toolkits that are
often used for topic modeling with LDA are MALLET (McCal-
lum, 2002), which provides a fast implementation of the Gibbs
sampling method described above,
and gensim (
ˇ
Reh
˚
u
ˇ
rek and
Sojka,
2010),
which implements the online variational
Bayes
method of Hoffman, Blei, and Bach (2010). The motivation for
the latter method was the application of LDA to data streams
or large datasets.
In addition to the method implementations
provided by MALLET and gensim,
other prominent methods
featuring in the topic coherence experiments that have not been
discussed so far include the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) of
Blei and Lafferty (2006), which attempts to directly model cor-
relation between the latent topics themselves, and the P
´
olya Urn
method proposed by Mimno,
Wallach,
Talley,
Leenders,
and
McCallum (2011), which extended Gibbs sampling to incorpo-
rate information used in the corresponding coherence metric.
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique for
decomposing a non-negative matrix
V ∈ R
into two non-negative
factors
W
and
H
, where
V ≈ WH
(Lee and Seung, 1999). Al-
though it has been used in multiple domains, it is also applicable
to topic modeling (Arora, Ge, and Moitra, 2012b).
In this con-
text,
V
is an
n × m
term-document matrix, and
W
and
H
are
reduced rank-
k
factors whose product is an approximation of
V
, with dimensions
W = n × k
and
H = k × m
. This enables
a parts-based representation, where
W
contains a set of
k
topic
basis vectors,
and
H
provides the coefficients for the additive
linear combinations of these basis vectors to generate the corre-
sponding document vectors in
V
. The weights in a
W
topic ba-
sis vector can be used to generate a topic descriptor consisting
of high-ranking terms (analogous to the most probable terms in
an LDA
φ
distribution),
while a
H
vector of coefficients can
be interpreted as the
k
topic membership weights for the cor-
responding document.
Two common objective functions (Lee
and Seung, 2001) used to generate
W
and
H
are the Euclidean
squared error:
n
X
i=1
m
X
j=1
(V
ij
− (W H)
ij
)
2
= ||V − W H||
2
F
(3)
and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, when
V
and
WH
both sum to 1 (thus acting as normalized probability distribu-
tions):
D(V ||W H) =
n
X
i=1
m
X
j=1

V
ij
log
V


(4)
NMF with KL divergence was previously shown to be equiv-
alent
to PLSA by Gaussier and Goutte (2005).
As an alter-
native to the multiplicative update rules approach of Lee and
Seung (2001) for determining
W
and
H
, Lin (2007) proposed
the use of a projected gradient
method with alternating non-
negative least squares.
Separately, to address the instability in-
troduced by standard random initialization of
W
and
H
, Bout-
sidis and Gallopoulos (2008) introduced deterministic initial-
ization with Non-Negative Double Singular Value Decomposi-
tion (NNDSVD), which is particularly suitable for sparse ma-
trices.
As with LDA,
here we are primarily concerned with
popular NMF variants, where the focus is upon the implemen-
tation of the method proposed by Lin (2007), with the squared
error objective function and NNDSVD initialization,
as pro-
vided by the scikit-learn machine learning library (Pedregosa,
Varoquaux,
Gramfort,
Michel,
Thirion,
Grisel,
Blondel,
Pret-
tenhofer, Weiss, Dubourg, Vanderplas, Passos, Cournapeau, Brucher,
Perrot, and Duchesnay, 2011).
2.2.
Topic Coherence
Although perplexity (held-out likelihood) has been a com-
mon method for the evaluation of topic models,
the study of
Chang,
Boyd-Graber,
Gerrish,
Wang,
and Blei
(2009) found
that
this was often negatively correlated with human judge-
ments of topic quality (using topics discovered with PLSI, CTM,
and LDA),
and suggested that
evaluation should be focused
upon real-world task performance that
includes human anno-
tation.
This has led to a number of studies that have focused
upon the development of topic coherence measures, which cap-
ture the semantic interpretability of discovered topics based on
their corresponding description terms (for example, the top
N
most probable terms from a
φ
distribution estimated by LDA).
Newman, Lau, Grieser, and Baldwin (2010) calculated the cor-
relation between human judgements and a set of proposed mea-
sures,
and found that
a Pointwise Mutual
Information (PMI)
measure achieved best
or near-best
out
of all
evaluated mea-
sures. This was based on co-occurrence frequency of each set of
top 10 (LDA) topic terms within a reference corpus (Wikipedia),
using a sliding window of 10 words,
with the mean pairwise
term PMI used as an individual
topic score,
where the intu-
ition was that terms that regularly co-occurred were likely to
produce coherent
topic descriptors.
A similar co-occurrence
measure was suggested by Mimno, Wallach, Talley, Leenders,
and McCallum (2011), which used log conditional probability
(LCP) rather than PMI (conditioned on the higher-ranking term
in each term pair), and was found to produce higher correlation
with human judgements than that of the latter.
In contrast to
Newman, Lau, Grieser, and Baldwin (2010), the co-occurrence
frequencies were calculated using the corpus being modeled,
rather than relying upon a reference corpus.
Here, LDA topics
were discovered using the Gibbs sampling method along with
their proposed extension.
Both of these measures were employed in the study of Stevens,
Kegelmeyer,
Andrzejewski,
and Buttler
(2012),
which com-
pared the coherence of topics generated by LSA,
NMF and
LDA using a model-level summarization. Although they found
that each of these methods had certain strengths, they also con-
cluded that NMF tended to produce more incoherent topics than
either of the other two methods.
Aletras and Stevenson (2013)
proposed measuring LDA topic coherence using distributional
similarity (DS) between the top terms,
where each term was
represented as a vector in a semantic space,
with topic coher-
ence calculated as mean pairwise vector similarity; Cosine sim-
3
ilarity,
Jaccard similarity,
and the Dice coefficient were used.
As before, these were correlated with human judgements, in ad-
dition to the PMI measure, a normalized variant of PMI (Bouma,
2009) (NPMI, range =
[−1, 1]
), and LCP. They found the term
vector similarity measures to compare favorably with those based
on PMI, in particular, Cosine similarity, while LCP performed
poorly in general,
where they suggested that the latter is sen-
sitive to the size of the modeled corpus.
Lau,
Newman,
and
Baldwin (2014) performed an empirical
comparison of these
four PMI, NPMI, LCP and DS measures in the context of the
original evaluation tasks used by Chang, Boyd-Graber, Gerrish,
Wang,
and Blei (2009) (using PLSI,
LDA,
and CTM),
where
the NPMI and DS measures were those most
strongly corre-
lated with the human raters at the topic level.
To address the
sparsity issue with using the corpus being modeled to calcu-
late term co-occurrence for LCP, as pointed out by Aletras and
Stevenson (2013) (and also an earlier work by Lau,
Baldwin,
and Newman, 2013), they proposed instead using the same ref-
erence corpus as required by the PMI measures.
More recently, R
¨
oder, Both, and Hinneburg (2015) proposed
a unifying framework that represented coherence measures as
a composition of parts,
with the objective of achieving higher
correlation with human judgements.
This was an attempt
to
address certain issues raised in their earlier work in relation to
coherence measures based on term co-occurrence (Rosner, Hin-
neburg,
R
¨
oder,
Nettling,
and Both,
2013).
The emphasis was
largely on topics discovered by LDA, as they followed the eval-
uation schemes of Newman, Lau, Grieser, and Baldwin (2010),
Aletras and Stevenson (2013),
and Lau,
Newman,
and Bald-
win (2014).
One clear observation that
can be made about
these previous works is the attention given to LDA or similar
probabilistic topic modeling methods,
where matrix factoriza-
tion methods such as NMF are very much in the minority.
The
current work aims to address this issue with a comparison of
topics discovered with NMF and LDA across multiple corpora,
particularly in light of our previous findings that the former pro-
duces more readily-interpretable topics (O’Callaghan, Greene,
Conway, Carthy, and Cunningham, 2013).

Data
A range of corpora were analyzed in this evaluation, where
we were focused upon both new and existing corpora contain-
ing documents that had been (manually) annotated with classes.
The first
new corpus contained news articles from the BBC
website
1
.
At the start of January 2014, we retrieved all tweets
up to the 3,200 Twitter REST API
2
limit for 71 manually se-
lected Twitter accounts affiliated with the BBC or its journalists
(for example, @BBCNews, @BBCSport, @bbcscitech), which
yielded a total of 91,616 tweets.
All unique URIs containing
the domains bbc.co.uk or bbc.com were extracted from these
tweets,
and the corresponding web pages (where still accessi-
ble) were then retrieved,
with the exception of a set of black-
1
http://www.bbc.com
2
https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api
listed URI prefixes (for example, those related to careers, adver-
tising and other non-news content).
From the retrieved pages,
we extracted and fetched web pages for all unique URIs con-
taining either of the two BBC domains that had not been previ-
ously fetched; this process was performed twice.
We then fil-
tered all retrieved articles that were published outside the time
period 2009-01-01 to 2013-12-31,
or whose publication date
could not be ascertained from the corresponding page metadata.
The article body text was extracted using the Java Boilerpipe
library
3
(Kohlsch
¨
utter, Fankhauser, and Nejdl, 2010), with arti-
cles containing empty body text being filtered. The final corpus
consisted of all articles in the top 40 sections, as annotated by
the BBC and extracted from the page metadata, where each ar-
ticle is assigned to exactly one section.
A similar process was used to generate a corpus contain-
ing news articles from the Guardian website
4
, where 29 manu-
ally selected Twitter accounts affiliated with the Guardian or its
journalists (for example, @guardian, @GdnPolitics, @guardian-
film) yielded a total of 184,284 tweets.
Unique URIs contain-
ing the domains guardian.co.uk or theguardian.com were used
to fetch the article text,
with the final corpus consisting of ar-
ticles found in the top 24 annotated sections as extracted from
the metadata,
with each article featuring one section annota-
tion.
Two additional
news corpora were extracted from the
New York Times Corpus,
which contains over 1.8 million ar-
ticles written and published by the New York Times (NYT) be-
tween January 1,
1987 and June 19,
2007,
in addition to arti-
cle metadata annotations (Sandhaus,
2008).
The first of these
corpora consisted of articles from 2003,
as also analyzed by
Stevens, Kegelmeyer, Andrzejewski, and Buttler (2012) in their
coherence evaluation of multiple topic modeling methods, with
the second containing a stratified 10% sample of articles from
2000 to 2007.
In contrast to our extracted BBC and Guardian
corpora,
the NYT articles can contain multiple section anno-
tations.
For both extracted corpora,
identifiable meta-sections
covering multiple topics were excluded, such as “Front Page”,
“Corrections”, and “Magazine”.
The final two corpora consisted of pages found on Wikipedia.
We initially selected eight top-level categories from the WikiPro-
ject
Council
Directory
5
that
had active sub-categories and/or
task forces,
and also selected the set of active sub-categories.
As the sub-categories found in each top-level category directory
are often not peers of each other in the hierarchy, sub-categories
at the highest level were chosen, for example a sport category
was selected as opposed to a category for a particular team. For
each category, a list of page titles in the classes ’FA’, ’FL’, ’A’,
’GA’,
’B’,
’C’ was retrieved from the corresponding category
class page,
and the page text was extracted from a Wikipedia
dump from January 2014 by means of a wrapper around the
WikiExtractor utility
6
.
This resulted in 42,170 page titles for

Topic Discovery and Descriptor Generation
A set of common pre-processing steps were applied to all
six corpora.
We initially compiled a “standard” set of 671 En-
glish stopwords from a variety of sources including those fea-
tured in the machine learning library scikit-learn (Pedregosa,
Varoquaux,
Gramfort,
Michel,
Thirion,
Grisel,
Blondel,
Pret-
tenhofer, Weiss, Dubourg, Vanderplas, Passos, Cournapeau, Brucher,
Perrot,
and Duchesnay,
2011),
the Natural
Language Toolkit
(NLTK) (Loper and Bird, 2002), and the MALLET toolkit (Mc-
Callum,
2002),
in addition to English honorifics and contrac-
tions documented on Wikipedia
8 9
.
These stopwords were fil-
tered, along with any terms containing common top-level-domains
such as “.com” or “.co.uk”.
URIs and terms containing digits
were also filtered, and ascii normalization was performed to re-
move diacritics. Terms were converted to lowercase, and a lem-
matizer was applied (NLTK wrapper around WordNet’s built-in
morphy function).
Stemming was not performed as it often led
to the subsequent generation of topic descriptor terms that were
not interpretable by an end user.
Finally, low-frequency terms
occurring in fewer than
l
of the total
m
documents were also
excluded, where the
l
threshold was set to
max(10, m/1000)
.
Although multiple variants exist
for both LDA and NMF
(for example,
Blei,
Griffiths,
Jordan,
and Tenenbaum,
2004;
Rosen-Zvi, Griffiths, Steyvers, and Smyth, 2004; Saha and Sind-
hwani,
2012),
we restricted the experiments to those that
are
popular and/or were used by the topic coherence papers dis-
cussed earlier in Section 2.1.
In the case of LDA,
we used
the fast Gibbs sampling implementation provided by the MAL-
LET toolkit
(McCallum,
2002),
with the same parameters as
found in the coherence evaluation code provided by Stevens,
Kegelmeyer, Andrzejewski, and Buttler (2012)
10
apart from an
increased number of iterations. This included the recommended

values (Steyvers and Griffiths,
2006) for the Dirichlet
hyper-
parameters
α
and
β
of
50/k
(
k
= number of topics) and 0.01
respectively (these are actually the default parameter values in
MALLET),
in addition to hyperparameter optimization for an
asymmetric Dirichlet prior over the document-topic distribution
θ
(Wallach, Mimno, and McCallum, 2009a).
LDA operates on
bag-of-words document representations, and the corresponding
feature sequences used by MALLET were created for each cor-
pus following the pre-processing steps described above.
For NMF, the same pre-processed corpus documents were
transformed to log-based Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors (Salton and Buckley,
1988),
and
subsequently normalized to unit length.
We used the squared
error NMF variant as provided by scikit-learn (Pedregosa, Varo-
quaux, Gramfort, Michel, Thirion, Grisel, Blondel, Prettenhofer,
Weiss, Dubourg, Vanderplas, Passos, Cournapeau, Brucher, Per-
rot, and Duchesnay, 2011), which is an implementation of the
fast alternating least squares method proposed by Lin (2007).
The Kullback-Leibler objective function was not considered for
this evaluation due to its equivalence to PLSA (Gaussier and
Goutte,
2005),
itself a probabilistic precursor to LDA.
To ad-
dress the instability introduced by random initialization in stan-
dard NMF,
the deterministic NNDSVD initialization method
was also employed (Boutsidis and Gallopoulos, 2008).
For each topic found by applying these variants of LDA and
NMF, a descriptor was created as follows:
1.
NMF
w
: the top 10 highest-ranking terms from the topic’s
basis vector in
W
k
, a factor of
V
T F −IDF
.
2.
LDA
u
:
the top 10 most probable terms from the topic’s
φ
distribution.
The
w
(weighted) and
u
(unweighted) notation reflects the
term weighting strategy employed,
in addition to the simplest
bag-of-words weighting strategy based on term frequencies. The
IDF pre-processing step used by NMF
w
down-weights the con-
tribution of TF in the case of frequent
(more general) terms,
while also boosting the contribution of rarer terms that may be
more discriminating.
As the analogous term weighting with
LDA
u
is effectively that of TF, we refer to it as unweighted for
the purpose of this evaluation. Although it is customary to gen-
erate LDA term descriptors using the most probable terms, Blei
and Lafferty (2009) state their preference for selecting the top
terms ranked using the score defined in Equation 5:
term-score
k,v

log
b
β

(
Q

)

This is inspired by TF-IDF weighting,
where the first ex-
pression
β
k,v
,
the probability of term
v
for topic
k
,
is analo-
gous to TF,
while the second expression down-weights terms
that have high probability across all
k
topics, somewhat similar
to IDF. As this operation mirrors the weighted nature of NMF
w
,
we also discovered topics by applying NMF to TF input vectors
V
T F
(minus the IDF component), which in turn mirrors the un-
weighted nature of LDA
u
. Thus, the following topic descriptors
are also generated:
3.
NMF
u
: the top 10 highest-ranking terms from the topic’s
basis vector in
W
k
,
a factor of
V
T F
.
As this is based
on a pre-processing operation,
these topics are entirely
separate to those of NMF
w
.
4.
LDA
w
: the top 10 highest-ranking terms, weighted using
Equation 5.
As this is based on a post-processing opera-
tion, these topics are the same as those used by LDA
u
At this point, we note that other work that measured coher-
ence of topics found by LDA appears to be largely focused upon
the LDA
u
topic term descriptors of option 2 (Newman,
Lau,
Grieser, and Baldwin, 2010; Mimno, Wallach, Talley, Leenders,
and McCallum, 2011; Stevens, Kegelmeyer, Andrzejewski, and
Buttler, 2012; Aletras and Stevenson, 2013; Lau, Newman, and
Baldwin, 2014).
4.2.
Measuring Topic Coherence and Generality
Having generated a set of topic models, the following topic
coherence measures were calculated for each of the four term
descriptor methods NMF
w
,
LDA
u
,
NMF
u
,
and LDA
w
,
with
N = 10
:
1.
TC-NPMI - Normalized PMI (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013;
Lau,
Newman,
and Baldwin,
2014) (the unnormalized
version originally proposed by Newman,
Lau,
Grieser,
and Baldwin (2010) was also calculated, but the normal-
ized version is reported here given its superior perfor-
mance as demonstrated by Lau, Newman, and Baldwin,
2014):

3.
TC-W2V - As an analog to the DS measures of Aletras
and Stevenson (2013),
we propose the creation of term
vectors
wv
using a word2vec model
(Mikolov,
Chen,
Corrado, and Dean, 2013a).
This tool provides two neu-
ral network-based algorithms for estimating word repre-
sentations in a vector space;
Continuous Bag-of-Words
(CBOW),
where the current word is predicted based on
its context, and Skip-gram, which predicts context words
based on the current word.
These approaches have been
found to generate word vectors that explicitly encode lin-
guistic regularities from large amounts of unstructured
text data (Mikolov, Sutskever, Chen, Corrado, and Dean,
2013b), and so are appropriate for use with a large refer-
ence corpus in the analysis of topic coherence.
Here, the
coherence score is the mean pairwise Cosine similarity
of two term vectors generated with a Skip-gram model:
TC-W2V

(8)
For each coherence measure,
we generated an aggregate
score for a particular
(
descriptor method,
k)
model by taking
the mean of the constituent topic scores.
Similar model-level
coherence scores were also used in the evaluation of Stevens,
Kegelmeyer,
Andrzejewski,
and Buttler (2012).
As suggested
by Mimno, Wallach, Talley, Leenders, and McCallum (2011), a
smoothing count
 = 1
was included as required to avoid taking
the logarithm of zero.
In addition to measuring topic coherence, we also analyzed
the generality of the topic descriptors for the four methods NMF
w
,
LDA
u
,
NMF
u
,
and LDA
w
.
Here,
generality is considered at
two levels; 1) the overlap or dependence between topics, based
on the appearance of terms in multiple descriptors for a partic-
ular model, and 2) the tendency for a method to generate topics
containing high-frequency descriptor terms from the underlying
corpus.
As discussed by Arora, Ge, Halpern, Mimno, Moitra,
Sontag,
Wu,
and Zhu (2012a),
some level
of similarity is to
be expected,
but lower numbers of unique terms across topic
descriptors can be an indication of less useful models.
The fol-
lowing steps were performed for each
(
descriptor method,
k)
model:
1.
The mean pairwise Jaccard similarity between the topic
descriptors
TD
was calculated.
Higher similarity values
indicate increased topic dependency:

2.
The probability distribution of descriptor term occurrences
across all topics was generated. Terms having high occur-
rence frequencies often appear to be general terms from
the underlying corpus.
Only the top
N
(10) descriptor terms are considered,
as
these are the terms that would be presented to an end user.
The
generality of the remaining terms for a particular topic is effec-
tively irrelevant.
In addition, we do not consider the raw term
values due to the different methods being evaluated.
5.
Evaluation
In this section,
we provide an evaluation of the four topic
descriptor methods NMF
w
, NMF
u
, LDA
u
, and LDA
w
in terms
6
of their corresponding coherence and generality, using the model-
level measures described in Section 4.
We also analyze the as-
sociated document-topic memberships by referencing the un-
derlying corpus class labels.
As we find similar patterns across
all six corpora,
we illustrate the differences in coherence and
generality between the methods by focusing specifically on the
BBC corpus results.
5.1.
Model coherence
Tokenized versions of the documents belonging to each of
the six corpora were generated using the pre-processing steps
described in Section 4.1, where the final statistics can be found
in Table 1.
For each corpus,
the documents were transformed
to log-based TF-IDF unit vectors, topics were discovered using
the scikit-learn implementation of NMF (including NNDSVD
initialization),
and the corresponding NMF
w
topic descriptors
were generated from the highest-ranking top 10 terms found
in each topic basis vector.
Similarly,
NMF was also applied
to TF vector representations of the documents to generate the
corresponding NMF
u
topic descriptors.
In the case of LDA,
the MALLET implementation was applied to the sets of docu-
ment feature sequences, from which the LDA
u
and LDA
w
topic
descriptors were generated respectively from the top 10 most
probable topic terms, and the top 10 topic terms following the
Blei and Lafferty normalization described in Equation 5.
In all
cases, topics were discovered for values of
k ∈ [10, 100]
(inter-
vals of
10
),
where this seemed to be a reasonable range given
the number of annotated classes (see Table 1), using the param-
eters for NMF and LDA as described in Section 4.1.
Coherence scores were then calculated for the four topic de-
scriptor methods, with co-occurrence frequencies generated for
the unique descriptor terms across all models using a reference
corpus for TC-NPMI and also for TC-LCP, due to the issues as-
sociated with using the corpus being modeled for the latter that
were highlighted by Aletras and Stevenson (2013),
and Lau,
Newman, and Baldwin (2014). This reference corpus consisted
of a Wikipedia dump from January 2014,
where the tokeniza-
tion process included filtering the same 671 stopwords as used
in pre-processing of the six corpora used for evaluation,
term
lemmatization, with all remaining terms retained. Following to-
kenization, the term co-occurrence frequencies were calculated
using a sliding window of 20 terms.
This tokenized Wikipedia
corpus was also used to create the word2vec model as required
by TC-W2V,
using the same parameters as the demo-word.sh
script provided with revision 37 of the source code
11
,
i.e.
the
Skip-gram model with word vector dimensions =
200
, max con-
text window skip length =
5
, hierarchical softmax enabled, neg-
ative sampling disabled,
and sample threshold =
1e
-
3
.
The
word2vec Cosine similarity between each pair of unique topic
descriptor terms was calculated at this point.
Mean model-level coherence scores for the four topic de-
scriptor methods are presented for TC-NPMI, TC-LCP and TC-
W2V in Figure 2,
Figure 3,
and Figure 4 respectively.

Table 2: Examples of pairwise differences between TC-LCP and the other three
coherence measures. TC-LCP tends to produce higher scores when one or both
terms are more general, this can be seen with the score from the pair containing
the general term
year
(
P (w
j
) = 0.08
) compared to that of the other pair with
the more specific term
education
(
P (w
j
) = 0.01
).
coherence score scale is less important
here,
where the rela-
tive difference between the methods is more interesting.
For
TC-NPMI and TC-W2V,
a certain level
of separation is ob-
servable between the weighted (
w
) and unweighted (
u
) topic
descriptor methods.
It appears that the weighted methods are
producing more coherent topics, where NMF
w
is regularly the
most
coherent
method with LDA
w
also performing strongly,
while the model-level coherence of the LDA
u
topic descriptors
(generated from the most probable terms for a particular topic)
is always lower.
This pattern is replicated across all
six cor-
pora.
However,
the situation seems to be somewhat reversed
in the case of TC-LCP,
where LDA
u
is found to be most co-
herent,
with the NMF methods performing poorly and LDA
w
positioned in-between.
We now illustrate the differences between TC-LCP and the
other two measures with an analysis of the coherence scores
of two pairs of terms that
were included in one of the BBC
topic descriptors that appears to education-related, where these
scores can be found in Table 2.
The term pair (school,
year)
yields a higher TC-LCP score than that of (school, education),
while the reverse is true for the other measures.

Figure 2: Mean topic TC-NPMI coherence scores for
k ∈ [10, 100]
.
both term pairs appear coherent.
However, it might be argued
that (school, education) is somewhat more coherent than (school,
year),
due to the general nature of the year term.
TC-NPMI,
being based on PMI,
considers the probability of both terms
in a particular term pair,
where frequent terms will be down-
weighted with respect to those that occur less frequently, such
as education from this example.
Lau,
Newman,
and Baldwin
(2014) discuss the bias of the unnormalized version of this mea-
sure (TC-PMI) towards lower frequent terms, which should be
corrected by TC-NPMI. At the same time, this example clearly
demonstrates that the TC-NPMI score is higher for the (school,
education) pair, which is further supported by the correspond-
ing word2vec Cosine similarity.
As the TC-LCP measure only
considers the probability of one (the highest-ranking) term for a
particular term pair, the appearance of general terms is less of an
issue, particularly when both terms are general. This behaviour,
coupled with the tendency for LDA to generate high-ranking
topic terms that are more general (Chemudugunta, Smyth, and
Steyvers,
2006) is likely the reason for the higher LDA
u
TC-
LCP scores.

duced by the NMF

methods, where
we were specifically interested in the overlap or dependence be-
tween topics, based on the appearance of terms in multiple de-
scriptors for a particular model, and the tendency for a method
to generate topics containing high-frequency descriptor terms
from the underlying corpus.
The mean Jaccard similarity be-
tween the topic descriptors generated by all four methods was

calculated, and the results for values of
k ∈ [10, 100]
are pre-
sented in Figure 5.
As with the coherence scores discussed in
Section 5.1, a pattern is observable across all six corpora, where
the highest levels of similarity are always found with the LDA
u
descriptors,
with NMF
w
producing those that
are least
simi-
lar in most cases.
LDA
w
also generates relatively low levels of
similarity, while it is interesting to note that there is a separation
between the unweighted methods LDA
u
and NMF
u
, where the
similarity of the latter is closer to those of the weighted meth-
ods.
The overlap in topics produced by LDA
u
due to lower
numbers of unique terms across its topic descriptors may be
an indication of less useful
(coherent) models,
as suggested
by Arora, Ge, Halpern, Mimno, Moitra, Sontag, Wu, and Zhu
(2012a).
It is likely that the different behaviour observed with
the Wikipedia corpora is related to the corresponding smaller
number of annotated classes.
Here, the pattern at
k = 10
(the
value of
k
that is closest to the actual number of classes) appears
similar to that of the other corpora.
This overlap can also be demonstrated by looking at the fre-
quency of terms occurring in
X
(multiple) descriptors,
where
Figure 6 contains the results for
X ∈ [2, 3, 4, ≥ 5]
from all four
methods, with
k = 100
. Here, it can be seen that LDA
u
consis-
tently generates higher frequencies of terms occurring in
X ≥ 5
descriptors. Further investigation finds that these are often gen-
eral terms from the underlying corpus.
For example,
Table 3
contains the top ten most frequent topic descriptor terms for the
BBC corpus with
k = 100
.
Although certain terms are oc-
curring frequently for all four methods (also seen in Figure 6),
those of LDA

appear to be general terms that may be less dis-
criminating when coherence is considered, with year and peo-

In the case of LDA

Both it and NMF

A number of

However, their relatively lower probability suggests that this is
less of an issue in comparison to the other methods.

Document-Topic Membership
Our main objectives in this work were the analysis of topic
descriptor coherence and generality. In addition, we completed
our evaluation with a brief look at the agreement between the
document-topic membership and the underlying corpus class
labels.
Although both LDA and NMF permit the assignment
of documents to multiple topics, we focused solely on disjoint
analysis where membership was assigned using the highest-
ranking topic for each document.
This can be justified due
to the fact
that
the classes in the six corpora are also largely
disjoint.
All documents assigned to multiple classes were ex-
cluded.
We used Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) to mea-
sure this agreement, which produces results in the range
[0, 1]
and corrects for chance agreement,
while also accounting for
the fact that MI tends to be larger with clusterings containing
higher numbers of clusters.
AMI scores for NMF

, and LDA
u
(
k ∈ [10, 100]
)
can be found in Figure 7.

topic descriptor method
is not included here as its descriptors are derived from the post-
processed LDA topic-term distributions; it has the same document-
topic distributions as LDA

Higher agreement scores with little dif-

It
is likely that these results are related to the smaller number of
annotated classes in the Wikipedia corpora. They may also sug-
gest the presence of a certain level of inaccurate document an-
notations.

Discussion
For all six corpora,
we have observed differences between
the scores generated by the weighted (NMF
w
, LDA
w
) and un-
weighted (LDA
u
, NMF
u
) topic descriptor methods. In the case
of the aggregate model-level
coherence scores,
the weighted
methods perform strongly for all measures apart from TC-LCP.
This appears to contrast with the evaluation of Stevens, Kegelmeyer,
Andrzejewski,
and Buttler (2012),
where they found that
the
TC-LCP scores were often in agreement with those of the un-
normalized version of TC-NPMI (the two coherence measures
used in their evaluation),
with the TC-LCP scores for NMF
matching or exceeding those of LDA for
k ≤ 100
.
Lau, New-
man, and Baldwin (2014) also observed strong correlation be-
tween the human coherence ratings and those of TC-LCP and
TC-NPMI. However, as they did not compare topics discovered
by the multiple methods they used with each other, it is unclear
whether we can draw many parallels between their correlation-
based findings and those of our own evaluation.
The measures related to topic generality find higher levels
of similarity between the descriptors generated by LDA
u
, along
with the promotion of general high-frequency corpus terms among
multiple descriptors.
This effect is less noticeable with LDA

Wallach,
Mimno,
and
McCallum (2009a) have pointed out that it is often customary
to create a corpus-specific stopword list to address this issue,
even if some of these play meaningful semantic roles. They also
suggest that using an asymmetric prior over the LDA document-
topic distribution
θ
can result in topics that are unaffected by
stopwords, with stopwords themselves being isolated in a small
number of topics.
However,
although we have enabled this
particular option in MALLET, we still observe the presence of
general terms in multiple descriptors, which is only decreased
when the Blei and Lafferty (2009) normalization of LDA
w
is
applied. We also note the differences in generality scores when
the value of
k
is considerably different to the number of under-
lying corpus classes,
as observed for both Wikipedia corpora
with
k > 10
.
Steyvers and Griffiths (2006) suggested the use of probabil-
ity distribution divergence measures such as Jensen-Shannon
divergence when calculating the similarity between terms or
documents following topic discovery; this is also applicable to
the topics themselves.
Although such measures can be applied
to both LDA topics and those discovered by NMF,
they were
not employed here as we were specifically concerned with the
top
N
topic descriptors that could ultimately be presented to an
end user.
Separately, Stevens, Kegelmeyer, Andrzejewski, and
Buttler (2012) also evaluated the impact of different

values on
the calculation of the two coherence measures they employed.
They found that using a small value of
 = 10
−12
resulted in a
decrease in coherence scores for NMF compared to LDA, par-

ticularly in the case of the PMI-based measure.
We also cal-
culated the TC-NPMI and TC-LCP scores using this

value,
where a similar decrease in coherence was observed for a sub-
set of the NMF models. However, a close inspection of some of
the coherence score distributions found that this small

value
produced significant outliers for term pairs that did not occur
together in the reference Wikipedia corpus. The fact that an in-
dividual topic descriptor’s score was calculated using the mean
of the constituent term pairwise scores meant that it was sen-
sitive to such outliers, which could lead to a low score even in
the case of a single term pair not occurring together while the
remaining term pairs were highly coherent.
It might in fact be
argued that taking the median of these pairwise scores is more
appropriate.
However,
we felt that the presence of descriptor
terms that do not occur together must be acknowledged, where
the use of
 = 1
, as originally suggested by Mimno, Wallach,
Talley, Leenders, and McCallum (2011), acts as a compromise
between both extreme cases.

Conclusions
In this work, we have described an analysis of the semantic
interpretability,
also known as topic coherence,
of the sets of
top terms generally used to describe topics discovered by a par-
ticular algorithm. This has been achieved with an evaluation of
popular variants of both probabilistic (LDA) and matrix decom-
position (NMF) topic modeling techniques on multiple corpora,
using a combination of existing and new measures that focus
13
on topic coherence and generality.
A common pre-processing
procedure has been employed for both techniques where pos-
sible,
without
relying on particular actions such as the gen-
eration of corpus-specific stopword lists.
We have found that
NMF regularly produces more coherent topic descriptors than
those generated by the standard approach used with LDA, with
higher levels of topic generality and redundancy observed with
the latter.
It appears that a key role is played by the associated
term weighting strategy, where modifications to document term
pre-processing and descriptor term post-processing can produce
markedly different results.
This evaluation has provided insight into the characteristics
and differences between the topic models produced by NMF
and LDA. While LDA may offer good general descriptions of
broader topics,
our results indicate that
the higher coherence
and lower generality associated with NMF topics mean that the
latter method is more suitable when analyzing niche or non-
mainstream content. Similarly, although improvements in topic
coherence have been found with the use of n-gram terms (Lau,
Baldwin, and Newman, 2013), here we have restricted the eval-
uation to use the common unigram-based approach. Regardless
of the topic modeling technique employed, it is clear that close
reading of any generated topics is essential.
As certain issues have been raised in relation to coherence
measures that are based on individual term pair co-occurrence
within a reference corpus (Rosner, Hinneburg, R
¨
oder, Nettling,
and Both,
2013) (albeit,
where NMF not was considered),
in
future work, we would like to investigate alternative measures.
We would also hope to perform a user survey in order to cor-
relate human judgements with our automated results, although
this would likely be different to prior coherence studies that re-
quested ratings of individual
topics,
(Newman,
Lau,
Grieser,
and Baldwin,
2010;
Mimno,
Wallach,
Talley,
Leenders,
and
McCallum,
2011;
Lau,
Newman,
and Baldwin,
2014),
where
descriptor comparisons would instead need to be considered.
