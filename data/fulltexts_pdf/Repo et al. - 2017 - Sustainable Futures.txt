Abstract 
There are increasing calls for engaging citizens in the development of future outlooks. At the same time, large‐scale public 
engagement activities warrant appropriate methods for analyzing their outcomes. This paper reviews how topic modeling 
could provide such a methodology, which both accounts for all textual data collected in public engagement activities, however 
large in scope, yet also allows for meaningful topical analysis. It compares topic modeling results concerning a corpus of 179 
citizen visions from 30 European countries on desirable and sustainable futures to those acquired through deliberative 
analysis. While both methodologies contend that European citizens’ outlook consists of education, sustainability in the 
economy, 
health 
concerns, 
and 
fairness 
in 
communities, 
and 
the 
particular 
strengths 
of 
topic 
modeling 
relate 
to 
its 
documentability, repeatability, cost efficiency, and scalability. Topic modeling can also be considered to support public 
engagement analytically from the perspective of knowledge formation rather than that of common sense.

Citizens 
are 
increasingly 
engaged 
in 
coproducing 
sustainable 
futures 
for 
reasons 
ranging 
from 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
insights 
to 
public 
accountability 
and 
empowerment 
(Renn 
and 
Schweizer 2009; Jasanoff 2003). In Europe, there is a 
growing strand of public engagement activities that 
target the steering of research and innovation activities. 
Yet, 
public 
engagement 
is 
costly 
to 
carry 
out 
in 
particular when it involves inviting large numbers of 
people and organizers to attend physical or virtual 
spaces to follow a common procedure. Therefore, it is 
of key concern to analyze the documented outcomes 
of 
participation 
events 
properly 
to 
make 
the 
engagement efforts worthwhile. 
New methodologies developed in the domain of 
digital 
humanities 
could 
serve 
this 
aim. 
Topic 
modeling, 
and 
more 
precisely 
latent 
Dirichlet 
allocation, is a methodology to identify word clusters 
(i.e. 
“topics”) 
in 
sets 
of 
documents 
(e.g. 
Gläser, 
Glänzel, and Scharnhorst 2017; Yau et al. 2014). This 
methodology is particularly suitable for discovering 
topical 
patterns 
that 
are 
spread 
across 
sets 
of 
documents 
as 
is 
often 
the 
case 
when 
public 
engagement activities provide textual documentation

(Stoneman, Sturgis, and Allum 2013). 
To 
review 
the 
particular 
usability 
of 
topic 
modeling and to examine its concurrent features, the 
authors apply the methodology of topic modeling to 
the 
outcomes 
of

Multi-Actor Consultation on Horizon 2020) project in 
which over 1,000 citizens in 30 countries
1
developed 
179 visions on desirable and sustainable futures. This 
public engagement exercise is the latest and largest in 
a series of the European Commission’s attempts to 
invite 
citizen 
contributions 
to 
the 
development 
of 
European research and innovation agendas. 
Using the visions as data, the authors compare the 
results obtained with the topic modeling methodology 
(topics), 
against 
those 
obtained 
from 
deliberative 
qualitative analysis executed by experts in a one-day 
workshop (themes). In particular, the authors examine: 
(1) if results from topic modeling conform with those 
from deliberative analysis; and (2) how these two 
methodologies 
differ 
in 
terms 
of 
validity 
and 
reliability, 
abstraction, 
cost 
efficiency, 
concept 
of 
public 
engagement, 
and 
the 
implications 
of 
their 
differences. 
The upcoming sections first describe why and how 
public 
engagement 
has 
gained 
a 
growing 
role 
in 
research and innovation agenda formation in Europe. 
Then the paper introduces the examined engagement 
data and describes the compared methodologies. Next, 
outcomes of the both methodologies are presented and 
matched. 
The 
concluding 
section 
of 
the

discusses the insights obtained from the comparative 
analysis 
from 
the 
perspectives 
of 
the

EUROPE SEEKS CITIZEN VISIONS FOR 
FUTURE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION 
AGENDAS 
The European Union actively engages citizens in the 
development 
of 
European 
research 
and 
innovation 
programs that focus on sustainability. Such citizen 
engagement 
has 
been 
accomplished 
in 
research 
activities 
funded 
by 
the 
European 
Commission 
in 
several domains. Valued experiences from citizens’ 
focus 
group 
interviews 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
waste 
management 
(VOICES 
2015) 
were 
thematically 
broadened 
with 
engagement 
that 
reviewed 
public 
health genomics and aging society through citizen 
consultations 
and 
technology 
assessment 
(PACITA 
2016). 
Public 
participation 
has 
also 
been 
guided 
towards sustainable innovation (Bedsted et al. 2016), 
leading 
to 
the 
development 
of 
engagement 
methodology in which citizens first envision futures 
that are together with expert assistance developed into 
input for research and innovation programs (CIVISTI 
2011). The CIMULACT project belongs to the same 
category of citizen engagement exercises as it invites 
citizens to envision desirable and sustainable futures, 
which are later transformed to input for research and 
innovation programs (Jørgensen and Schøning 2016). 
The 
accomplished 
engagement 
projects 
reflect 
enduring discussions in Europe that call for dialogue 
between institutions and citizens in societal debates 
(Ducci 
2013; 
Smallman 
2017). 
It 
has 
been 
of 
particular concern to engage citizens in the agenda 
setting stage of policy processes. Such “upstream” 
engagement has also been a policy response to public 
distrust 
in 
science 
especially 
on 
issues 
of 
sustainability (Burgess and Chilvers 2006; Wilsdon 
and Willis 2004). Accordingly, deliberation of new 
technologies and scientific discoveries starts early in 
order to modify the relationship between scientific and 
public decision-making, to avoid problems with public 
acceptance and to provide a broader view than only 
that of risk avoidance (Wilsdon and Willis 2004). This 
is in contrast with the “downstream” approach such as 
citizen science, which is a form of public engagement 
applied especially in America, as well as open science 
that focuses typically on the advancement of science 
or 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
technologies 
(Bowser 
and 
Shanley 2013). 
Public engagement is by no means unproblematic 
regardless of its upstream or downstream focus. Even 
when it addresses large-scale societal developments, it 
frequently 
relies 
on 
a 
collection 
of 
small-scale 
activities (Niemeyer 2011; Smallman 2017). Such was 
also the case with the studied citizen engagement 
Sociology Study 7(5) 
248
when the 179 citizen visions were developed by 1,088 
citizens in 30 European countries. One event was 
organized in each participating country, making the 
engagement exercise a collection of similarly executed 
workshops rather than a unifying, common event. It is 
then a highly complex task to make sense of the joint 
contribution of the participants of the separate events. 
People want to be heard in their own terms instead of 
those 
of 
scientists 
or 
other 
elites 
(see 
Nyaga 
and 
Torres 2015; Usman 2014), yet, outcomes still need to 
be 
conceptualized 
to 
become 
more 
exact 
and 
universally understood, as well as translated to further 
uses. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
context 
that 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
outcomes 
of 
public 
engagement 
merits 
particular 
attention. When public engagement is of large scale, 
taking place in numerous locations and with various 
compositions of attendants, it has been considered 
useful to involve event organizers and invited experts 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
outcomes 
to 
ensure 
that 
local 
contexts are properly considered. Such a deliberative 
analysis may indeed raise the quality of the results and, 
therefore, 
further 
the 
impacts 
of 
the 
engagement. 
Nevertheless, deliberative analysis may itself be costly, 
especially if it involves inviting a large number of 
engagement 
organizers 
anew 
together. 
Outcomes, 
processes, and preconditions of public engagement 
processes 
indeed 
merit 
empirical 
attention 
(Cobb 
2012). 
Qualitative 
and 
collaborative 
methodologies 
commonly facilitate the analysis of such engagement 
outcomes, but typically do not scale well to large 
amounts of data. For instance, the data examined in 
this paper consist of 179 elaborated citizen visions on 
desirable and sustainable futures, but the number of 
analyzed texts could easily be much higher in future 
online engagement exercises (see e.g. Coleman and 
Gotze 2001). This paper attempts to circumvent these 
tensions between contexts and scalability while also 
targeting methodological efficiency in the analysis of 
outcomes of public engagement. Doing so, it strives to 
retain the richness, diversity, and multitude evident in 
the 
outcomes 
of 
large-scale 
engagement 
activities. 
These 
features 
are 
important 
to 
consider 
when 
ensuring 
that 
outcomes 
provide 
opportunities 
for 
citizens to speak out on issues they themselves define, 
and in ways which do not hinder their messages to 
come through. 
Methodological developments in the analysis of 
natural languages allow using new approaches in the 
analysis of public engagement outcomes. This paper 
reanalyzes 
the 
outcomes 
of 
a 
large-scale 
public 
engagement process carried out by the CIMULACT 
project, which produced citizen visions on desirable 
and 
sustainable 
futures, 
and 
has 
been 
extensively 
analyzed and reported (Jørgensen and Schøning 2016; 
Riisgaard 
et 
al. 
2017). 
The 
methodology 
of 
topic 
modeling (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) is applied in the 
new analysis, identifying patterns of topics across the 
visions. The key task is then to review how well the 
results of the two analyses correspond. Thereby, this 
paper also contributes to issues relating to internal 
validity 
and 
external 
generalizability 
of 
topic 
modeling, 
which 
are 
still 
under 
discussion. 
This 
follows the suggested procedure of evaluating validity 
by comparing results from machine coding with those 
from 
manual 
coding 
when 
making 
sense 
of 
texts 
(Jacobi, van Atteveldt, and Welbers 2016; Gläser et al. 
2017). 
Furthermore, 
the 
paper 
provides 
a 
methodological comparison of these two approaches. 
In order to facilitate the comparison, the next sections 
first describe the data formed by the citizen visions 
and 
the 
two 
approaches: 
topic 
modeling 
and 
the 
deliberative analysis of the CIMULACT project. 
STUDIED VISIONS AND COMPARED 
METHODOLOGIES 
This paper relies on a comparison of two analyses, 
which utilize the same empirical dataset of citizen 
visions. The studied set of visions is described in the 
upcoming section, followed by descriptions of the two 
Repo et al. 
249
compared methodologies, which have been used in the 
analysis 
of 
the 
visions. 
In 
order 
to 
keep 
the 
two 
methodologies apart, the authors refer to the findings 
brought up by the topic modeling methodology as 
“topics” and to those emerging from the deliberative 
methodology utilized in the CIMULACT project as 
“themes”. 
Data: Citizen Visions on Desirable and 
Sustainable Futures 
The 
two 
analyses 
presented 
and 
compared 
in 
this 
paper are based on a dataset that is formed by 179 
citizen visions that were formulated in 30 European 
countries in so-called “National Citizen Vision” (NCV) 
workshops 
in 
the 
CIMULACT 
project 
between 
November 2015 and January 2016 (Jørgensen and 
Schøning 2016; Riisgaard et al. 2017). The citizen 
engagement 
process 
was 
minutely 
designed 
and 
strictly guided to ensure that an identical format of 
engagement was accomplished in all workshops to 
produce comparable yet freely formulated visions. 
The 
key 
task 
of 
the 
CIMULACT 
engagement 
process 
was 
to 
involve 
citizens 
in 
the 
actual 
formulation 
of 
agendas 
for 
the 
European 
Union’s 
Horizon 
2020 
research 
and 
innovation 
program, 
thereby showcasing an upstream engagement activity. 
It was expected of the citizen engagement process to 
provide deep insights on the wider societal needs of 
the people. To reach this goal, citizens were asked to 
imagine 
desirable 
and 
sustainable 
futures 
and 
to 
jointly form visions describing them. A vision, in the 
context 
of 
the 
CIMULACT 
NCV 
workshops, 
describes what the future should be like regardless of 
whether or not it is feasible from today’s point of view. 
The strictly steered process through which the citizens 
were guided was designed to empower the citizens 
into thinking that the future is something that can be 
shaped instead of it being predetermined. 
The NCV workshops lasted approximately eight 
hours in each country. Divided in small groups, the 
citizens in each national workshop jointly created six 
visions 
reflecting 
their 
desirable 
and 
sustainable 
futures. 
The 
citizens 
were 
asked 
to 
describe 
their 
vision for 2050 and to give concrete examples of what 
that vision would mean in the daily life of people. 
They were further asked to explain how the respective 
vision differs from today, assess its desirability, and 
consider concerns relating to it. The visions are all of 
a somewhat positive character because citizens were 
asked to turn dystopias to visions in which troubles 
had 
been 
solved. 
The 
workshop 
agenda 
included 
several stages of elaboration on the visions, giving all 
participants 
in 
each 
workshop 
the 
possibility 
to 
deliberate on the visions being developed in their own 
group and on those developed by other citizen groups. 
The final visions are each a narrative storyline of a 
desirable and sustainable future in 2050. Example 1 
below describes one of the 179 citizen visions. 
This vision is about self-sufficiency. In 2050 we are 
much less dependent on fossil fuel. All kinds of energy 
resources we did not use in 2016 are being used and every 
house 
has 
a 
solar 
power 
installation. 
Energy 
is 
being 
generated in diverse and creative ways, e.g. from physical 
exercising also at home or waste that cannot be recycled is 
converted 
into 
energy. 
Education 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
community and should have a lifelong perspective in order 
to increase acceptance and involvement towards innovations. 
Education about nature and environment learns (teaches) 
people about sustainable energy. The public transport is 
attractive 
and 
cheap 
and 
mostly 
underground. 
As 
a 
consequence of this all, the health levels have risen because 
there is much less air pollution. Every house has its own 
water circulation system (with filter). Roofs are used to store 
water and energy. People eat more conscious: organic, less 
meat, seasonal products, insects, etc. Nature is preserved. 
Robot 
and 
sensor 
technology 
are 
part 
of 
this 
vision. 
(Example 
1: 
Excerpt 
from 
citizen 
vision 
from 
the 
Netherlands: Energy) 
The full description of the vision is presented in 
Appendix 1 (Riisgaard et al. 2017). 
In addition to the joint procedure, much emphasis 
was 
given 
to 
the 
selection 
of 
citizens. 
The 
most 
important criterion in the selection of participating 
citizens 
was 
diversity 
in 
a 
national 
context. 
Sociology Study 7(5) 
250
Accordingly, the participants of the NCV workshops 
represent many kinds of people with regard to age, 
education, gender, and place of residence. Specific 
national 
contexts 
could 
be 
considered 
to 
increase 
variety 
of 
participants. 
In 
other 
words, 
reaching 
different kinds of people in a deliberative tradition 
was 
strived 
for 
rather 
than 
accomplishing 
strict 
representativity according to their background factors. 
The citizens, furthermore, needed to be lay people in 
the sense of not working professionally with science, 
technology, 
nor 
innovation. 
Altogether, 
1,088 
European citizens participated in the creation of the 
CIMULACT 
visions. 
The 
visions 
were 
initially 
created 
in 
the 
national 
languages 
of 
the 
30 
EU 
countries and later translated into English. The authors’ 
research makes use of the translated visions. 
Topic Modeling as a Methodology to 
Approach Citizen Visions 
When engagement is of large scale and creates much 
qualitative data that need to be analyzed quickly and 
reliably, computer tools designed for natural language 
processing are a useful option to rely on (Blei 2012; 
Gläser et al. 2017). The topic modeling of the citizen’s 
visions 
relies 
on 
latent 
Dirichlet 
allocation 
and 
is 
processed with the MALLET toolkit for statistical 
language processing (McCallum 2002). 
In short, topics across the vision data are identified 
through an analysis of probability of collocation of 
words, 
i.e. 
word 
clusters. 
Such 
clusters 
of 
words 
jointly 
represent 
meanings 
distributed 
across 
the 
visions. The topics are extracted from the full corpus 
(i.e. all visions), ensuring that all data are considered 
during the process. In the first stage of the topic 
modeling exercise, the data are processed to a form 
that is readable by the MALLET toolkit. In addition to 
removing repeating headings from the vision template, 
punctuation 
and 
special 
signs 
were 
also 
discarded 
from the corpus as well as removing upper-case letters. 
During the process, stopwords such as a, and, the, etc. 
are removed from the corpus by making use of the 
standard English stopword list of the MALLET toolkit 
expanded with person names. 
It is a key task in topic modeling to determine the 
number of examined topics (Gläser et al. 2017; Jacobi 
et al. 2016). In this study, the authors sought to identify 
the maximum number of topics to describe the data 
while 
still 
being 
able 
to 
explain 
and 
distinguish 
between the topics well. Too few topics miss out on 
important aspects of the data while too many make it 
difficult to distinguish between the topics. 
Accordingly, an iteration process for the search of 
an appropriate number of topics was initiated. From 
previous experience with similar data sets, the authors 
used seven topics as a starting point before examining 
five, nine, and 12 topics. Examining the data with five 
topics 
indicated 
that 
there 
was 
one 
large 
topic 
concerned with education in the corpus and that other 
topics could be interpreted and labeled well. The same 
large topic had existed in the original run with seven 
topics, 
and 
its 
smaller 
topics 
could 
readily 
be 
explained and labeled. Runs with nine and 12 topics 
kept the large topic, but made it increasingly difficult 
to distinguish between the other topics. In a final run 
with eight topics, the large topic remained and the 
seven smaller topics could be interpreted and labeled 
well. 
Hence, the corpus was modeled with eight topics. 
Diagnostics measures such as appearances of words in 
topics 
and 
documents, 
and 
their 
exclusivity 
were 
considered 
when 
interpreting 
and 
labeling 
topics. 
Standard 
hyperparameter 
optimization 
every 
10 
iterations was used to allow the model to better fit the 
data by allowing some topics to be more prominent 
than 
others, 
i.e. 
showing 
their 
Dirichlet 
parameter 
which reflects the weight of the topic in the corpus. 
While 
topic 
modeling 
includes 
an 
element 
of 
randomness, different runs produce similar results as 
the methodology is probabilistic. The results of the 
modeling are presented in Table 1. 
Topic 
modeling 
helps 
to 
discover 
reoccurring 
elements, 
i.e. 
topics,

the 
studied 
data

Repo et al.

introducing prior knowledge or frames of reference to 
the analysis. The method does not require any 
a priori
interpretations as such, except for the determination of 
the 
examined 
number 
of 
topics. 
Yet, 
as 
the 
methodology does not examine meanings of the words 
studied, 
their 
interpretation 
becomes 
a 
part 
of 
the 
research task. 
Deliberative Methodology Applied in the 
CIMULACT Project 
In 
order 
to 
analyze 
the 
outcomes 
of 
the 
citizen 
engagement, the approach of the CIMULACT project 
was 
to 
organize 
a 
one-day 
“Interactive 
Synthesis 
Workshop” (Warnke et al. 2017) in which 27 project 
team 
members 
and 
11 
external 
experts 
identified 
underlying 
themes 
in 
the 
citizen 
visions. 
This 
deliberative 
method 
was 
intended 
to 
increase 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
result 
by 
ensuring 
reflection 
on 
outcomes 
and 
by 
counteracting 
possible 
biases 
of 
individual participants, which could emerge from their 
expert 
and 
cultural 
backgrounds. 
The 
identified 
themes were designed to be later used in the creation 
of research programs for Europe, and were considered 
to have strong legitimacy and power particularly due 
to the deliberative and participatory approach. Such a 
process of identifying themes in bodies of textual data 
is 
an 
established 
approach 
in 
qualitative 
methodologies. Corbin and Strauss (1990) as well as 
others in the qualitative research tradition relate such 
thematization 
to 
categorization 
and 
abstraction 
of 
content. Themes are to be developed in terms of the 
dimensions of the phenomenon they depict and in the 
context in which it is expressed. 
Before 
the 
workshop, 
involved 
project 
team 
members and experts each read 30 citizens’ visions 
allocated to them from the complete set of 179 visions. 
In the first stage of the workshop, the participants 
were divided in six groups, each of which had a task 
to 
identify 
five 
“social 
needs” 
in 
the 
material 
consisting of the allocated 30 visions (Warnke et al. 
2017). The identification of social needs was first 
accomplished individually in the groups. Then the 
suggestions of each member of the group were jointly 
discussed until a common understanding was reached, 
which resulted in a total of 29 identified social needs. 
In the second stage, 12 themes i.e. clusters of the 
identified 
social 
needs 
were 
created 
based 
on 
similarities, 
while 
each 
of 
the 
initial 
visions 
was 
attached to a suitable theme in small, deliberative 
groups. This turned out to be a difficult task, as the 
visions are very diverse in character. Each vision can 
also encompass a number of social needs and the end 
result was that most visions were attached to several 
needs 
while 
some 
were 
not 
attached 
to 
any 
need 
(Warnke 
et 
al. 
2017). 
This 
required 
a 
phase 
of 
post-processing 
of 
visions 
to 
social 
needs 
by 
the 
project team after the workshop. The process up to the 
creation of 12 themes is presented in Figure 1. 
The CIMULACT approach focused at the number 
of 
outcomes, 
finding 
cross-cutting 
issues 
and 
at 
raising the abstraction level of themes. Only themes 
relating 
directly 
to 
a 
certain 
sustainability 
issue 
(economy, 
energy, 
or 
food) 
ended 
up 
not 
to 
correspond to more than one social need. The final 
themes 
were

FINDINGS FROM THE TWO 
METHODOLOGIES 
To facilitate the comparison of the two methodologies, 
i.e. topic modelling and deliberative analysis, it is first 
useful to have a look at the outcomes that they 
contribute. The analysis based on topic modeling 
has been carried out by the authors of this paper, 
and they did not take part in the deliberative analysis 
of the Interactive Synthesis Workshop, which was 
Sociology Study 7(5) 
252
Figure 1. Process of the CIMULACT Interactive Symbiosis Workshop to the Creation of 12 Themes (See 
Warnke et al. 2017). 
accomplished 
in 
the 
CIMULACT 
project. 
If 
the 
results of the two analyses conform, topic modeling 
could be seen as a viable alternative for deliberative 
analysis (cf. Gläser et al. 2017; Jacobi et al. 2016). 
Differences, on the other hand, would highlight the 
particular character of each methodology. 
Modeled Topics in Citizen Visions 
This 
section 
presents 
results 
from 
topic 
modeling 
carried out on the data of the citizen visions. The eight 
topics produced are presented in Table 1 below. The 
topics 
were 
named 
i.e. 
labeled 
to 
reflect 
their 
collocated keywords. Diagnostic data such as word 
frequencies, 
exclusivity, 
and 
distribution 
characteristics were used in addition to the keyword 
list in Table 1. The procedure of labeling involves 
qualitative 
interpretation 
although 
it 
is 
based 
on 
results from modeling. A good label depicts the topic 
well and differentiates it from the other topics, and is 
meaningful for others to understand. 
The weights of the topics (Dirichlet parameter) are 
presented 
in 
the 
second 
column 
of 
the 
table, 
showing the relative prevalence of each topic in the 
corpus of citizen visions. All topics except for the 
largest one gain fairly balanced weights depicted by 
the Dirichlet parameter (range from .247 to .125), 
which implies that the visions corpus can be well 
presented with eight topics. 
The largest topic with the most relative weight in 
the 
vision 
corpus 
concerns 
“Education 
for 
future 
society” (Dirichlet parameter 2.504). The weight of 
the topic indicates that the corpus of visions sees 
education to support the emergence of future society 
while taking comprehensively into account a great 
variety of aspects that contribute to desirable life and 
sustainability. Due to its prevalence in the visions, the 
topic of education should be considered differently 
than other topics. It indeed represents more an overall 
approach to reach to the future than an education 
concern to be addressed. 
The topic “Responsible consumption” relates to 
taking responsibility of the environment in terms of 
products, 
energy, 
and 
water. 
Making 
ecological 
choices and applying a longer perspective when doing 
so relate to this topic. 
The 
topic 
labeled 
“Justice 
for 
all” 
addresses 
citizens’ wishes to live in just communities, where 
differences in cultures are accepted. Transparency and 
accountability then relate to success and wellbeing on 
the one hand and trade and carbon neutrality on the 
other. 
“Culture of disease prevention” presents a view of 
a world were diseases are not only treated but also 
actively prevented. Health is strived for systematically

Health

systems 
are 
well 
developed to support healthy lifestyles. 
“Planet with scientific futures” corresponds to the 
idea 
of 
technological 
solutions 
emerging 
from 
scientific 
research, 
which 
globally 
guides 
the 
development 
of 
societies. 
New 
technologies 
are 
expected to challenge and replace old technologies 
and 
open 
new 
opportunities 
that 
are 
currently 
unimaginable. 
These 
could 
include 
new 
modes 
of 
transportation or even space travel. 
The topic of “Local citizen collectives” focuses on 
the development within cities. Cities gather collectives 
of people and parents save time when they share the 
responsibilities of taking their children to school in 
turns, thus contributing also to sustainability. Public 
places are accessible and open. 
“Participatory community” differs from the topic 
of 
local 
citizen 
collectives 
in 
its 
focus 
on 
the 
community 
aspect. 
It 
is 
based 
on 
a 
vision 
of 
communities participating in the development of their 
regions. 
It 
involves 
the 
participatory 
support 
of 
knowledge 
creation 
and 
mobility. 
Inclusive 
approaches reduce the danger of conflicts and ensure 
secure and free living. 
“Active families” presents a functional view of 
society in which families take the responsibility of 
their lives in relation to health issues and personal 
development of talents. Families are then also in a 
position to introduce creative harmony in the society. 
These eight topics provide an encompassing view 
on citizen visions on desirable and sustainable futures. 
They 
describe 
the 
hopes 
and 
dreams 
of 
involved 
citizens and present various levels of abstraction. On 
the one hand, there are topics that arch over the whole 
humankind, such as “Planet with scientific futures” or 
“Justice for all”, implying deep changes in the current 
structures and the functioning of the society. On the 
other, some topics focus on individuals and their role 
in the future, such as “Local citizen collectives” or 
“Active families”. Moreover, the results of the topic 
modeling show one common and a very clear priority 
Sociology Study 7(5) 
254
of 
the 
European 
citizens: 
education. 
For 
the 
emergence of a future society that is desirable and 
sustainable, education emerges as a key supporting 
issue across all European countries. 
Themes Emerging From Deliberative Analysis 
Results from the deliberative analysis are used as a 
comparative 
reference 
point 
for 
those 
of 
topic 
modeling, 
which 
were 
presented 
in 
the 
previous 
sections. In the deliberative analysis, the identification 
of visions’ themes was carried out in an interactive 
process consisting of several stages. Key observations 
were made first, then these were elaborated into social 
needs, which in turn were clustered to the 12 themes. 
The themes were labeled accordingly, but with words 
that did not necessarily emerge from the citizens’ 
visions. 
Instead, 
the 
labels 
are 
punchy 
and 
use 
descriptive catchwords such as “harmony”, “holistic”, 
“life-long”, and “strengths-based”. 
Table 2 presents the results of the deliberative 
analysis in more detail. The table provides a short 
description of each of the 12 themes in addition to 
their names. The short descriptions list the underlying 
social needs which have been assigned to them and 
brief descriptions of these needs (Warnke et al. 2017). 
The 
theme 
labeled 
“Citizenship 
awareness 
and 
participation” corresponds to education that empowers 
citizens, provides personal freedom and responsibility, 
and promotes participation in governance. “Equality” 
supports such social goals by targeting social justice, 
accessibility of education, and equal and open access 
to health care system. “Unity and cohesion” further 
portrays 
a 
society 
with 
room 
for 
all, 
community 
building 
and 
development, 
and 
education 
by 
the 
community. 
“Green habitats”, in turn, reviews transport and 
contrasts rural and urban areas while also accounting 
for city development. The theme labeled “Harmony 
with nature” takes the sustainability dimension one 
step further and considers balance with nature and is 
accompanied with education for green living. 
“Holistic 
health” 
pays 
attention 
to 
preventive 
health care and sees technology to provide healthier 
living. “Life-long processes” continues with the theme 
of healthy life and combines it with life-long learning. 
“Personal 
development” 
provides 
a 
more 
individualistic 
approach 
to 
balancing 
life 
and 
meaningful 
work, 
while 
encouraging 
personal 
and 
spiritual 
development. 
It 
also 
follows 
up 
on 
technology and sees it serve human beings and society. 
“Strengths-based education and experiential learning” 
highlights enhancement of quality of education while 
it 
acknowledges 
hands-on 
applied 
learning 
and 
actionable knowledge learning. 
Three 
themes 
are 
labeled 
directly 
sustainable: 
economy, energy, and food. These three themes are 
further united by that they all correspond to only one 
social need, as identified in the deliberative process. 
“Sustainable economy” values economy for wellbeing 
and 
sustainability 
while 
“Sustainable 
energy” 
accentuates the need for sustainable production and 
consumption 
of 
energy. 
Sustainable 
food, 
in 
turn, 
highlights 
equal 
access 
as 
well 
as 
a 
sustainable 
production and dissemination of healthy food. Altogether, 
the 12 themes identified in the citizen visions through 
deliberation 
provide 
a 
good 
reference 
point 
for 
a 
comparative review of the two methodologies. 
COMPARISON OF FINDINGS AND 
METHODOLOGIES 
A key task of this paper is to compare if the results 
from topic modeling conform with those from 
deliberative analysis. As matches between results 
cannot be complete due to the probabilistic and 
qualitative characters of the methodologies as well as 
the richness of the data on citizen visions, the authors 
first observe parallel topics and themes. Close parallels 
would indicate that topic modeling is a valid approach 
to analyze such data on citizen involvement. Then the 
authors discuss how these two methodologies differ in 
terms of validity and reliability, abstraction of outcomes,

Table 2. Twelve Themes Emerging From Deliberative Analysis of Citizen Visions 
Name of theme 
Short description of theme 
Citizenship awareness 
and participation 
Education for citizenship (education that supports citizenship, empowers people to fulfill the role of 
citizen), personal freedom and responsibility (balance between technology and personal values, 
maximize your happiness), control and influence through participation in governance (effective 
engagement in decision making, citizen taking responsibility) 
Equality 
Social justice (basic income, social cohesion, gender equality, equal access to healthcare), accessible 
education (free education, fair territorial equity), equal and open access to health care system 
(securing public funding, non‐discrimination) 
Green habitats 
Fast, flexible, affordable, smart, reliable, and clean transport, balanced and fair development of both 
rural and urban areas (unfair balance of developmental chances leaving the countryside 
abandoned), enabling systems for green and smart city development (stopping pollution, 
developing healthier cities) 
Harmony with nature 
Balance with nature (less harmful activities to preserve life on a livable planet, nature as part of 
daily life even in cities), education for green living (sustainability education as a transversal concept 
including life‐cycle thinking and global perspective) 
Holistic health 
Holistic and preventive health care system (to improve the quality of life and life expectancy, help 
people to take care of themselves), healthier living provided by technology (health by technology, 
research and develop for health technology, convenience self‐treatment and autonomy) 
Life‐long processes 
Healthy life from childhood to old age (long living rely on healthy lifestyles and taking responsibility 
for one’s own health), life‐long learning (as a human right aiming to achieve the individual and 
societal full‐potential) 
Personal development 
Balanced life and meaningful work (realignment between work and personal and community life), 
personal and spiritual development (encouraging and enabling personal development to grow 
more skilled, balanced, and happy individual), technology serving human beings and society 
(technologies which enhance human capabilities) 
Strengths‐based 
education and 
experiential learning 
Enhance quality of education (restructuring content and learning context, personalisation), 
hands‐on applied learning and actionable knowledge (learning which develops personal interests 
and skills, develops awareness about everyday issues, acquires a profession) 
Sustainable economy 
Economy for wellbeing and sustainability (consumers/modesty and responsibility, work for 
money/status improve in society) 
Sustainable energy 
Need for sustainable production and consumption of energy (different energy mixes, self‐sustaining 
regions) 
Sustainable food 
Sustainably produced, healthy, clean, and responsible food (accessible for all, locally and ethically
produced food is safe, healthy, and nutritious) 
Unity and cohesion 
A society with room for all (diversity with increased interaction and integration), community 
building and development (solidarity and cooperation, responsibility, social cohesion), education 
by the community/shared learning (education powered by the community)

Topics and Themes Match 
It is meaningful to compare the results from the topic 
modeling carried out in this paper with the outcomes 
of the deliberative analysis in the CIMULACT project 
because 
they 
both 
attempt 
to 
represent 
comprehensively the same set of data. At the same 
time, this comparison functions as a validation test of 
the topic modeling. If topics and themes find their 
parallels, the methodology of topic modeling can be 
considered validated in this context. 
Parallels between the topics and the themes are 
matched in Figure 2. The labels of the topics and their

keywords as well as the names of the themes and their 
short descriptions have been used in the comparison. 
The comparison shows that all topics and themes can 
be matched with parallels of which many are direct 
and 
the 
remaining 
are 
existing 
albeit 
weaker. 
Education, 
sustainability 
in 
the 
economy, 
health 
concerns, and fairness in communities are highlighted 
in 
European 
citizen 
visions 
on 
desirable 
and 
sustainable futures. 
On the whole, both the topic modeling and the 
deliberative theme approach provide well-grounded 
interpretations of the citizen visions. One particular 
observation needs, nevertheless, to be made. One topic 
is of quite a different magnitude than the others, which

is not reflected in the deliberative analysis. “Education 
for future society” indeed dominates the results of 
topic 
modeling, 
and 
parallels 
directly 
to 
several 
deliberatively 
constructed 
themes 
of 
“Citizenship 
awareness and participation”. Weaker parallels can be 
observed to the themes “Strengths-based education 
and experiential learning” and “Harmony with nature”. 
“Education 
for 
future 
society” 
nevertheless 
most 
clearly 
challenges 
the 
results 
of 
the 
deliberative 
analysis due to its prevalence across the corpus. The 
topic 
contrasts 
its 
approach 
to 
the 
future 
against 
several 
deliberated 
themes 
that 
implicitly 
include 
education as an idea but target specific solutions. 
In addition: 
(1) 
“Responsible 
consumption” 
finds 
its 
direct 
parallels 
in 
“Sustainable 
energy” 
and 
“Sustainable 
economy”, while also addressing “Sustainable food” 
at 
a 
weaker level. 
“Justice 
for 
all” 
finds 
a direct 
parallel in the theme of “Equality”, highlighting that 
citizen calls for justice, wellbeing, and accountability. 
(2) 
The 
topic 
concerning 
“Culture 
of 
disease 
prevention” parallels directly with the theme of “Holistic 
health” and to a lesser degree with “Life-long processes”. 
Disease 
prevention 
relates 
to 
advances 
in 
medical 
treatment and technologies, although the deliberated 
themes focus more on people’s responsibilities. 
(3) Perhaps surprisingly, the topic labeled “Planet 
with scientific futures” finds only a weak parallel with 
one theme: “Personal development”. The parallel is 
weak because this theme is not coherent, and only one 
of its subthemes corresponds to the topic (Technology 
serving 
human 
beings 
and 
society). 
The 
lack 
of 
coherence 
of 
the 
theme 
“Personal 
development” 
becomes clear when considering its weak parallels 
also to the topics of “Participatory community” and to 
“Active 
families”, 
both 
accounting 
for 
human 
development. 
(4) “Local citizen collectives”, on the other hand, 
has a direct parallel in the curiously named theme 
“Green habitats”. This theme relates to transport, rural 
and urban areas, and smart cities. Naming the theme 
“green” appears to involve an agenda or a direction 
towards which to proceed. 
(5) “Participatory community” also has a direct 
parallel in “Unity and cohesion”, both accounting for 
community 
as 
an 
asset 
in 
actively 
contributing 
to 
sought targets such as peace, freedom, solidarity, and 
cooperation. 
The comparative analysis shows that six of the 
eight modeled topics have direct parallel counterparts 
in deliberated themes. The remaining two modeled 
topics 
also 
have 
thematic 
counterparts, 
but 
their 
connection is weaker. Additionally, weaker parallels 
could be observed also concerning those topics which 
had direct parallels to deliberated themes. 
The observed parallels between the modeled topics 
and 
the 
deliberated 
themes 
indicate 
that 
both 
approaches relate well to the data studied, i.e. the 
citizen visions, and to each other. This observation 
provides validation of that topic modeling can be used 
as a methodology to analyze textual corpuses which 
are produced in public engagement activities of this 
kind. These parallels also indicate that topic modeling 
is a valid approach to analyze such a collection of 
textual 
data, 
while 
accomplishing 
it 
even 
with 
a 
smaller 
number 
of 
topics 
than 
in 
the 
compared 
deliberative method. 
Methodological Implications Vary 
Despite similar outcomes between topic modeling and 
deliberate 
analysis, 
there 
are 
indeed 
differences 
between the two methodologies. Differences can be 
identified e.g. in terms of processes, approach, and 
interpretation of results and as they stem from two 
distinctly 
different 
kinds 
of 
methodologies, 
it 
is 
worthwhile 
to 
consider 
their 
particular 
characters. 
Table 3 reviews the epistemological characters and 
practical usability of examined methodologies. The 
criteria 
for 
methodological 
comparison 
have 
been 
developed 
from 
works 
on 
public 
engagement 
by 
Kahane et al. (2013), Renn and Schweizer (2009), as 
well as basic criteria for scientific work.

Concerning validity and reliability, topic modeling 
is rooted in the quantitative analysis of texts, and its 
methodology is readily documented and analyses are 
easily 
repeatable. 
Deliberative 
analysis 
as 
it 
was 
carried out in the CIMULACT workshop, in contrast, 
relies on the expertises of the participants and can 
further make use of the contextual setting of the public 
engagement. 
The 
contextual 
understanding 
as 
a 
difference in approach also has effects on how the 
examined texts are considered and on the outcomes of 
replications 
of 
analyses. 
Topic 
modeling 
itself 
is 
carried out on the full corpus and its outcomes thus 
reflect this corpus in full. Deliberative analysis, in 
contrast, relies on the expertises of the analysts and 
thereby carries a risk of omitting relevant data from 
the analysis. A replicated analysis is unlikely to lead 
to identical outcomes concerning either methodology, 
but the outcomes of topic modeling will be similar due 
to 
its 
probabilistic 
character. 
Deliberative 
analysis 
appears more prone to rely on invited expertises and 
situational settings. This helps to explain why the 
dichotomy 
of 
urban 
and 
rural 
issues 
emerges 
in 
deliberative analysis while it remains unnoticed in 
topic modeling. 
The methodologies also vary in their abstraction of 
outcomes. Topic modeling reflects on common, public 
interests while those of deliberative analysis may be 
more strategically focused and thereby varied. Yet 
concerning 
abstraction, 
topic 
modeling 
provides 
varying outcomes which range from concrete to very 
abstract, from actors to targets, and from values to 
actions. 
Deliberative 
analysis, 
instead, 
provides 
similar kinds of abstractions, which highlight values 
and targets. 
There are also differences in the cost efficiency 
between the two methodologies, which are important 
to consider when accomplishing public engagement. 
Topic modeling requires a moderate investment in 
methodological competences, and does not provide 
narratives 
of 
results 
during 
analysis. 
Deliberative 
analysis, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
does 
not 
require 
significant 
investment 
in 
special 
methodological 
competences, yet directly provides sought narratives 
during analysis. However, gathering a large number of 
Repo et al. 
259
experts to provide deliberative analysis itself requires 
a 
significant 
allocation 
of 
resources, 
and 
reduces 
flexibility. Scalability, i.e. how large a corpus can be 
analyzed, 
is 
much 
greater 
for 
topic 
modeling 
as 
computing resources are abundant while resources of 
experts are costly and scarce. 
Finally, 
both 
methodologies 
represent 
very 
different approaches to the analysis of outcomes in 
public engagement. Topic modeling is post-modern in 
that 
it 
focuses 
on 
knowledge 
formation 
and 
it 
is 
principle 
non-normative 
and 
neutral 
towards 
expression 
of 
values, 
for 
instance. 
Deliberative 
analysis as it was carried out in the CIMULACT 
project, on the other hand, relied on common sense 
and focused on the consequences of outcomes (see 
Renn 
and 
Schweizer 
2009), 
and 
is 
therefore 
programmatic 
and 
agenda-based. 
Indeed, 
topic 
modeling brought forth the roles of individuals in the 
societies of the future, whereas deliberative analysis 
accentuated the responsibilities of individuals, thereby 
providing a more normative interpretation of citizen 
visions. 
In conclusion, although the two sets of topics and 
themes both relate well to the studied data and to each 
other, 
they 
do 
indeed 
represent 
two 
distinct 
approaches to examining data developed in public 
engagement. Yet, the differences can be considered to 
represent complementarity rather than contradiction, 
and thereby do not have significant impact on the next 
steps 
in 
public 
engagement, 
i.e. 
proceeding 
from 
analysis 
of 
citizen 
contributions 
(visions) 
to 
early 
formulations 
of 
messages 
or 
priorities. 
Further 
analysis is necessary to determine which suits better 
the studied data, and the outcome of this analysis may 
also relate to preferences on the usability or contextual 
focus of results from the analysis. Topic modeling 
could 
be 
used 
to 
provide 
descriptive 
data 
for 
succeeding deliberative analysis, if not even replacing 
deliberative analysis, or through savings to provide 
better 
opportunities 
to 
enlarge 
the 
scope 
of 
participants 
in 
the 
deliberative 
analysis. 
In 
the 
deliberative 
analysis 
as 
it 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
CIMULACT project, relying on topic modeling could 
have 
replaced 
the 
need 
for 
deliberative 
analysis 
altogether, replaced project workers with a greater 
number of invited experts in the deliberation, or added 
citizens to the deliberation. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Large-scale public engagement activities may provide 
much data which need to be analyzed to be translated 
to 
policy 
action.

compared 
two 
methodologies for an analysis of citizen engagement 
outcomes and reviewed how well the methodology of 
topic 
modeling 
suits 
this 
aim. 
It 
compared 
the 
methodology of topic modeling with the approach of 
deliberative analysis, and examined the same data on 
citizen visions on desirable and sustainable futures 
(Jørgensen and Schøning 2016; Riisgaard et al. 2017). 
On 
both 
accounts, 
the 
European 
prospects 
on 
the 
future are formed by education, sustainability in the 
economy, 
health 
concerns, 
and 
fairness 
in 
communities. 
Topic modeling provided results which rather well 
adhere to those results that emerged in deliberative 
analysis. 
The 
analysis 
also 
confirms 
that 
large 
amounts of citizen generated data can be reviewed 
quickly and reliably with computer tools (Blei 2012; 
Gläser et al. 2017; Jacobi et al. 2016). Such analysis 
further 
follows 
citizen 
contributions 
closely 
as 
it 
eliminates the need to rely on separate interpretive 
frameworks. Yet, although results appear parallel, and 
follow-up 
steps 
in public 
engagement 
may 
further 
unify 
outcomes, 
it 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
there 
are 
notable differences in the epistemological base and 
practical arrangements between topic modeling and 
deliberative analysis. 
Particular attention should be paid to what the 
outcomes represent, and to what kinds of narratives or 
policy messages the outcomes contribute to (Cobb 
2012; Smallman 2017). Topic modeling appears to 
Sociology Study 7(5) 
260
suit a more neutral and descriptive approach than 
deliberative 
analysis, 
which 
enables 
to 
translate 
analysis of outcomes towards programmatic agendas. 
The latter balances to its part the significant allocation 
of resources, which easily relates to gathering large 
numbers 
of 
experts 
for 
deliberation. 
When 
the 
outcomes of public engagement are used for policy 
aims, such as the steering of research and innovation 
programs, 
the 
translation 
nevertheless 
needs 
to 
be 
made carefully. 
Further work needs to be carried out to determine 
how the methodology of topic modeling could best 
support public engagement activities. If successfully 
implemented, 
it 
could 
strengthen 
or 
replace 
deliberative 
analysis 
as 
well 
as 
save 
economic 
resources, which could be used to extend the scope or 
depth of engagement itself. Some types of large-scale 
engagement 
activities 
may 
even 
depend 
on 
methodologies 
such 
as 
topic 
modeling. 
The 
CIMULACT project was successful in engaging over 
1,000 citizens in 30 countries, but if massive open 
online public engagement is to become commonplace, 
it 
requires 
appropriate 
methodologies 
for 
data 
analysis. 
Appendix 1 
Full description of citizen vision from the Netherlands 
(Riisgaard et al. 2017) is as follows: 
Title of vision: Energy
Description of our vision for 2050 
This vision is about self-sufficiency. In 2050 we 
are much less dependent on fossil fuel. All kinds of 
energy resources we did not use in 2016 are being 
used and every house has a solar power installation. 
Energy is being generated in diverse and creative 
ways, e.g. from physical exercising also at home or 
waste that cannot be recycled is converted into energy. 
Education is the basis of the community and should 
have 
a 
lifelong 
perspective 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
acceptance 
and 
involvement 
towards 
innovations. 
Education 
about 
nature 
and 
environment 
learns 
(teaches) people about sustainable energy. The public 
transport 
is 
attractive 
and 
cheap 
and 
mostly 
underground. As a consequence of this all, the health 
levels 
have 
risen 
because 
there 
is 
much 
less 
air 
pollution. Every house has its own water circulation 
system (with filter). Roofs are used to store water and 
energy. People eat more conscious: organic, less meat, 
seasonal products, insects, etc. Nature is preserved. 
Robot and sensor technology are part of this vision. 
In your desirable future, what is different from 
today? 

Self-supporting. 

Solar energy. 

Use of smart sources, resources, substances and 
materials. 

Use of nature: subterranean storage, for instance 
for water, toilets, energy. 

Every 
house 
has 
its 
own 
energy 
supply 
and 
storage (with the chance to exchange energy) and 
water recycling system. 

Energy storage is legally arranged. 
Is your vision desirable for everyone? Are there 
any concerns? 
The 
wish 
is 
that 
it 
should 
be 
desirable 
for 
everyone (within Europe). 
What is your vision in brief? 
Energy independence. 
Exchange of self-supplying energy. 
Stimulate innovation.
