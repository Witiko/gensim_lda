Abstract
To support empirical study of online pri-
vacy policies,
as well
as tools for
users
with privacy concerns,
we consider
the
problem of aligning sections of a thousand
policy documents, based on the issues they
address. We apply an unsupervised HMM;
in two new (and reusable) evaluations, we
find the approach more effective than clus-
tering and topic models.

Introduction
Privacy policy documents are verbose,
often eso-
teric legal documents that many people encounter
as clients of companies that
provide services on
the web.
McDonald and Cranor (2008) showed
that,
if users were to read the privacy policies of
every website they access during the course of a
year,
they would end up spending a substantial
amount
of their time doing just
that
and would
often still
not
be able to answer basic questions
about
what
these policies really say.
Unsurpris-
ingly,
many people do not
read them (Federal
Trade Commission, 2012).
Such policies therefore offer an excellent
op-
portunity for
NLP tools that
summarize or
ex-
tract
key information that
(i) helps users under-
stand the implications of agreeing to these poli-
cies and (ii) helps legal
analysts understand the
contents of these policies and make recommenda-
tions on how they can be improved or made more
clear.
Past
applications of NLP have sought
to
parse privacy policies into machine-readable rep-
resentations (Brodie et
al.,
2006) or extract
sub-
policies from larger documents (Xiao et al., 2012).
Machine learning has been applied to assess cer-
tain attributes of policies (Costante et
al.,
2012;
Ammar et al.,
2012;
Costante et al.,
2013;
Zim-
meck and Bellovin, 2013).
This paper instead analyzes policies in aggre-
gate,
seeking to align sections of policies.
This
task is motivated by an expectation that many poli-
cies will
address similar issues,
1
such as collec-
tion of a user’s contact,
location,
health,
and fi-
nancial information, sharing with third parties, and
deletion of
data.
This expectation is supported
by recommendation by privacy experts (Gellman,
2014) and policymakers (Federal Trade Commis-
sion,
2012);
in the financial
services sector,
the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
requires these institu-
tions to address a specific set of issues.
Aligning
policy sections is a first step toward our aforemen-
tioned summarization and extraction goals.
We present the following contributions:
•
A new corpus of
over
1,000 privacy policies
gathered from widely used websites,
manually
segmented into subtitled sections
by crowd-
workers (
§
2).
•
An unsupervised approach to aligning the pol-
icy sections based on the issues they discuss.
For example,
sections that
discuss “user data
on the company’s server” should be grouped to-
gether.
The approach is inspired by the appli-
cation of hidden Markov models to sequence
alignment in computational biology (Durbin et
al., 1998;
§
3).
•
Two reusable evaluation benchmarks
for
the
resulting alignment
of
policy sections
(
§
4).
We demonstrate that our approach outperforms
na
¨
ıve methods (
§
5).

corpus and benchmarks are available at

Data Collection
We
collected
1,010
unique
privacy

documents
from the
top
websites
ranked
by
Alexa.com.

These policies were collected during
a period of six weeks during December 2013 and
January 2014.
They are a snapshot

policies of mainstream websites covering fifteen
of Alexa.com’s seventeen categories (Table 1).

Finding a website’s policy is not trivial. Though
many well-regulated commercial websites provide
a “privacy” link on their homepages,
not
all
do.
We found university websites to be exceptionally
unlikely to provide such a link. Even once the pol-
icy’s URL is identified, extracting the text presents
the usual challenges associated with scraping doc-
uments from the web.
Since every site is differ-
ent in its placement of the document (e.g., buried
deep within the website, distributed across several
pages, or mingled together with Terms of Service)
and format (e.g., HTML, PDF, etc.), and since we
wish to preserve as much document
structure as
possible (e.g., section labels), full automation was
not a viable solution.
We therefore crowdsourced the privacy policy
document
collection using Amazon Mechanical
Turk.
For
each website,
we created a HIT in
which a worker was asked to copy and paste the
following privacy policy-related information into
text
boxes:
(i) privacy policy URL;
(ii) last
up-
dated date (or effective date) of the current privacy
policy;
(iii) privacy policy full
text;
and (iv) the
section subtitles in the top-most layer of the pri-
vacy policy.
To identify the privacy policy URL,
workers were encouraged to go to the website and
search for
the privacy link.
Alternatively,
they
could form a search query using the website name
and “privacy policy” (e.g.,
“Amazon.com privacy
policy”) and search in the returned results for the
most
appropriate privacy policy URL.
Given the
privacy policy full
text
and the section subtitles,
we partition the full privacy document into differ-
ent sections, delimited by the section subtitles.
A
privacy policy is then converted into XML.
Each HIT was completed by three workers, paid
$0.05,
for a total
cost
of $380 (including Ama-

gory was excluded since it contains mainly popular websites

icy analysis presents interesting challenges for future work.
zon’s surcharge).

Approach
Given the corpus of privacy policies described in
§
2,
we designed a model
to efficiently infer an
alignment of policy sections. While we expect that
different kinds of websites will likely address dif-
ferent privacy issues,
we believe that many poli-
cies will
discuss roughly the same set
of issues.
Aligning the policies is a first step in a larger effort
to (i) automatically analyze policies to make them
less opaque to users and (ii) support legal experts
who wish to characterize the state of privacy on-
line and make recommendations (Costante et al.,
2012; Ammar et al., 2012; Costante et al., 2013).
We are inspired by multiple sequence alignment
methods in computational biology (Durbin et al.,
1998) and by Barzilay and Lee (2004),
who de-
scribed a hidden Markov model (HMM) for doc-
ument content where each state corresponds to a
distinct topic and generates sentences relevant to
that
topic according to a language model.
We
estimate an HMM-like model on our corpus,
ex-
ploiting similarity across privacy policies to the
extent
it
is evident
in the data.
In our formula-
tion, each hidden state corresponds to an issue or
topic,
characterized by a distribution over words
and bigrams appearing in privacy policy sections
addressing that issue.
The transition distribution
captures tendencies of privacy policy authors to
organize these sections in similar orders,
though
with some variation.
The generative story for our model is as follows.
Let
S
denote the set of hidden states.
1.
Choose a start state
y
1
from
S
according to the
start-state distribution.
2.
For
t = 1, 2, . . .
, until
y
t
is the stopping state:
(a)
Sample the
t
th section of the document by
drawing a bag of terms,
o
t
, according to the
emission multinomial
distribution for state
y
t
.
Note the difference from traditional
HMMs, in which a single observation sym-
bol
is drawn at
each time step.
o
t
is gen-
erated by repeatedly sampling from a dis-
tribution over
terms that
includes all
uni-
grams and bigrams except those that occur
in fewer than 5% of the documents and in
more than 98% of the documents.
This fil-
tering rule was designed to eliminate unin-
formative stopwords as well
as company-
specific terms (e.g.,

, according to the
transition distribution over

.
This model
can nearly be understood as a hid-
den semi-Markov model (Baum and Petrie, 1966),
though we treat the section lengths as observable.
Indeed,
our model
does not
even generate these
lengths,
since doing so would force the states to
“explain” the length of each section,
not
just
its
content.
The likelihood function for the model is
shown in Figure 1.
The parameters of the model
are almost
iden-
tical
to those of a classic HMM (start
state dis-
tribution,
emission distributions,
and transition
distributions),
except
that
emissions
are
char-
acterized

than

1989).
After learn-
ing,
the most
probable assignment
of a policy’s
sections to states can be recovered using a variant
of the Viterbi algorithm.
We consider three HMM variants.

Evaluation
Developing a gold-standard alignment of privacy
policies would either require an interface that al-
lows each annotator to interact with the entire cor-
pus of previously aligned documents while read-
ing the one she is annotating, or the definition (and
likely iterative refinement) of a set
of categories
for manually labeling policy sections.
These were
too costly for us to consider,
so we instead pro-
pose two generic methods
to evaluate models
for sequence alignment
of a collection of docu-
ments with generally similar content.
Though our
model
(particularly the restricted variants) treats
the problem as one of alignment,
our evaluations
consider groupings of policy sections.
In the se-
quel, a grouping on a set
X
is defined as a collec-
tion of subsets
X
i
⊆ X
; these may overlap (i.e.,
there might be
x ∈ X
i
∩ X
j
) and need not be ex-
haustive (i.e., there might be
x ∈ X \
S
i

).

The questions
were inspired primarily by the substantive interest
of these domain experts—not by this particular al-
gorithmic study.
For thirty policies,
we obtained answers from
each of six domain experts who were not involved
in designing the questions. For the purposes of this
study,
the experts’ answers are not important.
In
addition to answering each question for each pol-
icy,
we also asked each expert to copy and paste
the text
of
the policy that
contains the answer.
Experts were allowed to select
as many sections
for each question as they saw fit, since answering
some questions may require synthesizing informa-
tion from different sections.
For
each of
the nine questions,
we take the
union of all
policy sections that
contain text
se-
lected by any annotator as support for her answer.
This
results
in nine groups
of
policy sections,
which we call
answer-sets denoted
A
1
, . . . , A
9
.
Our method allows these to overlap (63% of the
sections in any
A
i
occurred in more than one
A
i
),
and they are not exhaustive (since many sections
of the policies were not deemed to contain answers
to any of the nine questions by any expert).
Together,
these can be used as a gold standard
grouping of policy sections, against which we can
compare our system’s output. To do this, we define
the set of section pairs that are grouped together
in answer sets,
G = |{ha, bi |
∃A
i
3 a, b}|
,
and
a similar set of pairs
H
from a model’s grouping.
From these sets,
we calculate estimates of preci-
sion (
|G ∩ H|/|H|
) and recall (
|G ∩ H|/|G|
).
One shortcoming of this approach,
for which
the second evaluation seeks to compensate, is that
a very small, and likely biased, subset of the policy
sections is considered.
4.2
Evaluation by Direct Judgment
We created a separate gold standard of judgments
of pairs of privacy policy sections.
The data se-

.
lected for judgment was a sample of pairs stratified
by a simple measure of text similarity. We derived
unigram tfidf vectors for each section in each of
50 randomly sampled policies per category.
We
then binned pairs of sections by cosine similarity
(into four bins bounded by 0.25,
0.5,
and 0.75).
We sampled 994 section pairs uniformly across the
15 categories’ four bins each.
Crowdsourcing was used to determine, for each
pair,
whether the two sections should be grouped
together.
A HIT consisted of a pair of policy sec-
tions and a multiple choice question, “After read-
ing the two sections given below,
would you say
that
they broadly discuss the same topic?”
The
possible answers were:
1.
Yes,
both the sections essentially convey the
same message in a privacy policy.
2.
Although, the sections do not convey the same
message,
the broadly discuss the same topic.
(For ease of understanding,
some examples of
content on “the same topic” were included.)
3.
No, the sections discuss two different topics.
The first two options were considered a “yes” for
the majority voting and for defining a gold stan-
dard.
Every section-pair was annotated by at least
three annotators (as many as 15,
increased until
an absolute majority was reached).
Turkers with
an acceptance rate greater than 95% with an ex-
perience of at
least
100 HITs were allowed and
paid $0.03 per annotation.
The total cost includ-
ing some initial
trials was $130.
535 out
of the
994 pairs were annotated to be similar in topic. An
example is shown in Figure 2.
As in
§
4.1, we calculate precision and recall on
pairs. This does not penalize the model for group-
ing together a “no” pair; we chose it nonetheless
because it is interpretable.

Baselines.
Our first baseline is a greedy divisive
clustering algorithm
6
to partition the policy sec-
tions into ten clusters.
In this method,
the de-
sired
K
-way clustering solution is computed by
performing a sequence of bisections.
The imple-
mentation uses unigram features and cosine simi-
larity. Our second baseline is latent Dirichlet allo-
cation (LDA; Blei et al., 2003), with ten topics and
online variational Bayes for inference (Hoffman et
al.,
2010).
7
To more closely match our models,
LDA is given access to the same unigram and bi-
gram tokens.

Conclusion
We considered the task of
aligning sections of
a collection of roughly similarly-structured legal
documents, based on the issues they address.
We
introduced an unsupervised model
for
this task
along with two new (and reusable)
evaluations.
Our experiments show the approach to be more ef-
fective than clustering and topic models.
The cor-
pus and evaluation data have been made available
at
http://usableprivacy.org/data
. In
future work,
policy section alignments
will
be
used in automated analysis to extract useful infor-
mation for users and privacy scholars.
