Abstract.
The automatic detection of
seven types
of
modifiers
was
studied: Certainty, Uncertainty, Hypotheticality, Prediction, Recommen-
dation, Concession/Contrast and Source. A classifier aimed at detecting
local cue words that signal the categories was the most successful method
for five of
the categories.
For Prediction and Hypotheticality,
however,
better results were obtained with a classifier trained on tokens and bi-
grams present in the entire sentence. Unsupervised cluster features were
shown useful
for the categories Source and Uncertainty,
when a subset
of the training data available was used.
However,
when all
of the 2,095
sentences that had been actively selected and manually annotated were
used as training data, the cluster features had a very limited effect. Some
of the classification errors made by the models would be possible to avoid
by extending the training data set, while other features and feature rep-
resentations, as well as the incorporation of pragmatic knowledge, would
be required for other error types.

Introduction
Stance detection and sentiment analysis are typically modelled as binary classi-
fication tasks within the field of natural
language processing.
That is,
authors
express stance by positioning themselves as for or against a given target or topic,
or sentiment by giving a positive or negative opinion [11]. It has, however, been
argued that this simple, binary model does not capture the full complexity of the
language used for expressing stance and opinions [6].
Instead,
authors employ
a wide range of
modifiers in their opinionated language.
The first aim of
this
study is to investigate the automatic detection of seven types of such modifiers.
Many classification tasks within natural language processing rely on a large
set of
manually annotated training samples.
However,
in the cases when large
training sets are not available,
resource-aware methods must instead be relied
upon.
Active learning is one such resource-aware method that has previously
been shown successful for detecting language modifiers. The method is built on
2
the idea to reduce the number of training samples required by actively selecting
useful samples. Using a previously applied active learning approach as a baseline,
the second aim of this study is to investigate two methods with a potential
to
improve this approach: (i) to provide annotations with a higher granularity and
(ii) to incorporate machine learning features derived in an unsupervised fashion.

Background
Based on previous research [6], we study seven types of possible ways in which the
categories positive/negative sentiment or stance for/against can be modified.
3
Certainty and Uncertainty are epistemic modifiers,
which in the context of
sentiment and stance taking might also give information about the strength
with which an opinion is expressed.
The following three evaluations would all
be classified as positive:
“The arguments are irrefutable and readers will
defi-
nitely enjoy the trip back in time”,
“The arguments are accurate and readers
will enjoy the trip back in time”, and “The arguments seem accurate and readers
might enjoy the trip back in time”. Still, given their different values on the Cer-
tainty/Neutral /Uncertainty scale, they all convey a slightly different message.
The modifiers Hypotheticality, Recommendation and Prediction indicate that
an expression is not necessarily true at the moment at which it is expressed. For
instance,
the Hypotheticality in “If it had been less complicated,
it would have
been good” makes it into an expression of negative sentiment, despite containing
“good”.
“A good film should never be too complicated” could,
on the surface,
be a positive or neutral expression. However, since it is a Recommendation, it is
likely to rather have been primed by a negative opinion. Finally, “Her next film
will be the best ever made”, expresses positive sentiment without any indications
of uncertainty, but since it is a Prediction, the author is likely to be less certain
of this opinion, than had it been about a film that already had been made.
That an expression contains Concession/Contrast
typically indicates that
opinions of different polarities are expressed, e.g., “I enjoyed reading this book,
but parts of
it were boring”.
The occurrence of
a contrast affects the overall
opinion conveyed, i.e., the overall opinion is not likely to be unequivocally posi-
tive or negative. Finally, if an expression contains a statement of its Source, this
also modifies how an opinion should be interpreted.
That is,
the existence of a
source indicates that the opinion expressed is not necessarily the opinion of the
author, e.g., “According to the guide book, this is the best restaurant in town”.
We are only aware of one previous study in which resource-aware approaches
have been applied for detecting stance and sentiment modifiers [14].
By sim-
ulating active learning,
that study showed that active sampling outperformed
random sampling of
training data for categories that closely resemble Uncer-
tainty,
Hypotheticality and Concession/Contrast.
We therefore here apply the
same successful
active learning method as our baseline method.
In contrast to
the previous study,
we do not simulate active learning,
but use it as the real

3
sampling method for creating our training corpus. We also apply the method to
a wider range of modifier categories than in the previous study, and we evaluate
the effect of extending the method with additional resource-aware techniques.
3
Method
The baseline active learning method was compared to two extensions (i) to add
more granular annotations and (ii) to use features from unlabelled data. A pre-
viously constructed gold standard corpus, in which the seven categories studied
here had been (doubly) annotated [6]
was used as evaluation data.
This gold
standard corpus consisted of opinionated texts in the form of political blogs on
the topic of
Brexit.
The same procedure that had been used for creating this
gold standard corpus was applied to create a large pool
of
data to use in the
process of
active selection of
the training samples that were annotated in the
present study.
That is,
documents from URL:s that started with the word blog
and that contained expressions related to Brexit were downloaded.
Boilerplate
text,
non-English text and HTML code were then removed using jusText,
and
the text was segmented into sentences with the standard sentence segmentation
technique included in NLTK [2]. It was also ensured that no duplicates from the
gold standard were included in the pool
of unlabelled data.
The annotation of
the actively selected sentences was performed with an annotation tool [9] specif-
ically designed for this task. Sentences selected for annotation were presented to
the annotator, who classified them according to the seven modifying categories
included in the study. Annotation was conducted on the basis of a sentence, with
respect to whether the sentence included a modifier (one or more) or not.
One
sentence at a time, without context, was presented for annotation. The annota-
tor could also mark a sentence as irrelevant if it was a result of a pre-processing
error (e.g., boiler plate texts or incomplete sentences). All annotations were per-
formed in an entirely topic-independent fashion.
That is,
a sentence was,
for
instance, classified as Uncertain if it contained uncertainty in general, regardless
of whether this uncertainty was targeted towards a statement related to Brexit.
The active sampling of training data was performed according to the active
learning method that had previously been shown successful
for modifiers [14].
That is, the training samples that were estimated to be most useful for a support
vector machine classifier were actively selected for annotation from the pool
of
unlabelled data. The estimation was based on the standard method of selecting
the unlabelled sample closest to the separating hyperplane of the classifier [16].
The Scikit-learn [12] SVC class with a linear kernel was used for implementing
the data selection.
A separate binary SVM model
was trained for each of
the
seven categories, using unigrams and bigrams as features and the same classifier
settings that had previously been shown successful for detecting modifiers [14].
A previously constructed vocabulary with 20 terms signalling each of the modi-
fying categories studied was used for creating the seed set required to start the
active learning process. Three corpus sentences containing each one of these vo-
cabulary terms were selected from the pool of unlabelled data to form a seed set.
4
The annotator first annotated the sentences in the seed set.
Thereafter,
active
learning was applied to select the five most useful unlabelled sentences for each
one of the seven categories. These sentences were then manually annotated, and,
thereafter, the models were retrained, also including these newly annotated sen-
tences.
This process was then repeated,
until
2,095 actively selected sentences
had been annotated to form the training set. Results achieved when evaluating
the SVM classifier on the gold standard corpus were used as the baseline results.
3.1
Adding annotations with a higher granularity
We hypothesised that the categories studied are mainly expressed by local
cue
words, and that it would therefore not be optimal to model the task as the text
classification task based on sentence-level occurrences of unigrams and bigrams
that was used in the training data selection process.
Instead,
we hypothesised
that the task would be more suitable to model as a chunk detection task, with
the aim of detecting chunks that function as cue words for the categories stud-
ied. A second round of annotation was therefore performed on the training data,
in which annotations on a more granular level
were provided,
on a token-level
instead of on a sentence-level. That is, the tokens signalling the modifying cat-
egories were marked, using the Brat annotation tool [15].
A classifier was,
thereafter,
trained to detect tokens/chunks signalling the
modifying category in question. For evaluation, the detected chunks were, how-
ever,
transformed back to a text classification format,
in order to match the
format of
the sentence-level
annotations of
the gold standard.
That is,
if
the
classifier marked a token/text chunk as signalling a modifier category, the sen-
tence containing the token/chunk was classified as belonging to that category.
As classifier, Scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression classifier was used. The choice was
based on an external
requirement to provide classifications with easily inter-
pretable confidence estimates,
which would not be provided by,
e.g.,
an SVM
or a rule/lexicon-based classifier.
The token to be classified,
as well
as the two
tokens immediately preceding and the one following it were used as features. To
limit the dimensionality of the feature vectors created, a minimum of three occur-
rences in the training data was required for a neighbouring token to be included
as a feature,
while a minimum of three occurrences in the entire pool
of unla-
belled data was required for the current token. A suitable value for the logistic
regression regularisation parameter was determined by 30-fold cross-validation
on the training data.
Similar to previous studies [10], information derived from a large, unlabelled
corpus was also incorporated as features. This was achieved by applying the Gen-
sim library [13], through which semantic vectors in the form of word embeddings
from an out-of-the-box word2vec model trained on Google news
4
are provided.
Semantic vectors corresponding to the words in the training corpus were clus-
tered using dbscan clustering [5], and each of the n clusters created were given a
unique representation in the form of a cluster representation vector of length n.

That is, all vector elements were set to 0, except the one element that represented
the cluster, which was set to 1. The cluster information was incorporated in the
feature representation for a token by (i) determining which cluster was closest
to the semantic vector that corresponds to the token (measured through the
Euclidean distance between the semantic vector and the cluster centroids), and
(ii) concatenating the cluster representation vector of this cluster to the feature
representation for the token. A maximum Euclidean distance of 0.8 between two
semantic vectors in the same cluster was allowed when performing the dbscan
clustering.
This distance was determined by manually inspecting the semantic
coherence in a subset of created clusters, for different distances.

Results and discussion
Models using the three methods investigated were trained on two versions of
the training corpus,
after 1,525 actively selected sentences had been annotated
and after 2,095 actively selected sentences had been annotated. F-scores obtained
when evaluating these models against the gold standard are presented in Table 1,
and precision and recall are presented in Figure 1.
The hypothesis that a chunk detection model would be most suitable seems
to hold for five of the categories. For Hypotheticality and Prediction, however, the
sentence-level classifiers performed better. The general trend (with the exception
of
Certainty) was that the baseline method resulted in a better recall,
while
better precision was shown by the other two methods investigated.
When only
1,525 training data samples were used,
the cluster features had (i) a relatively
large positive effect on the Source category and (ii) a small positive effect on the
Uncertainty category. The effects of incorporating cluster features were, however,
very limited when all data available was used.
Regardless of which method was used, only the results for the best-performing
classifier, Concession/Contrast, were close to the annotator agreement. Results
for the best performing chunk-level models were, therefore, analysed to identify
frequent reasons for false negatives, i.e.,
when the classifier failed to detect the
category in question,
and false positives,
i.e.,
sentences incorrectly classified as
belonging to the category in question.
Table 2 lists typical
challenges to the
classifiers (referred to as Ex. 1.1–16.5 in the following paragraphs).
In sentences annotated according to the category Uncertainty,
there were
eight frequently used words, including “think”, “should” and “would” that caused
classification problems (Ex. 1.1–8.2).
These words occurred in 76%/75%/59%
of the true positives/false negatives/false positives, respectively. Whether these
words function as cues for uncertainty can,
sometimes,
be determined by the
words in their context. As many of the examples illustrate, however, pragmatic
knowledge is often required to determine what they indicate,
i.e.,
knowledge
that is not possible to capture without using vast resources of annotated data.
Some of these words were also frequently used in sentences classified into Hypo-
theticality (“could”, “would”, “should” or “might” occurred in 89% of the false
negatives and 66% of
the false positives for Hypotheticality ).
This might have

Best results for each data size
are shown in bold.
F-scores for the intra-annotator agreement are provided with a
relatively low confidence (as they were calculated on half of the gold standard corpus)
and no point estimates are, therefore, given. Instead, confidence intervals (95%) were
computed with a bootstrap resampling approach [7],
using the 2.5/97.5 percentiles
of 10,000 bootstrapping folds.
Category frequency is the percentage of sentences that
contain the category in question (in the gold standard/after 1,525 training sentences

caused additional difficulties for the classifiers, and might be the reason why the
baseline classifier,
which used cues from the entire sentence,
outperformed the
chunk-based one for the category Hypotheticality. Many previous studies (for in-
stance [4, 8, 14], but not [17]) have (i) grouped Hypotheticality and Uncertainty
into one category,
and (ii) treated,
e.g.,
“think”/“should”/“could” as markers
for Uncertainty regardless of the pragmatics (Ex. 1.3/1.4/2.4/3.4), which might
explain why lower results were achieved here than in previous studies (Table 1).
For the category Certainty, 24% of the false negatives included either one of
the words “clear” or “sure”, and there were also other expressions, for which it is
dependent on the context whether they signal Certainty, e.g., “of course”. The
classifier,
however,
also failed to detect many evident cues for Certainty,
e.g.,
“definitely” and some (but not all) modified uncertainty cues,
e.g.,
“without
doubt” and “too plausible”. There were also confusions between Certainty and
Uncertainty, for cases that might be equally challenging for a human (Ex. 9.1).
For 13% of the false negatives for Concession/Contrast, an expression of con-
trast started the sentence. This might be explained by that contrast markers of-
ten start a sentence without signalling contrast (Ex. 13.1). The expressions “even
if”, “yet”, “and then” caused another 10% of the false negatives (Ex. 10.3, 10.4),
while 20% contained more univocal
contrast markers,
e.g.,
“compared with”.
Most false negatives did, however, not contain an explicit contrast marker, but
expressed antithesis [1], e.g., by applying negations or antonyms (Ex. 14.1–14.4).
These constructions are impossible to detect by the models applied here,
but
more complex approaches would be required, e.g., approaches built on external
semantic resources that model semantic relations between words.
For Source, 17% of the false negatives and 26% of the false positives contained
versions of the ambiguous expressions “appear”,
“seem” or “see” (Ex. 7.1-8.2).
75% of
the remaining false negatives contained a clear cue that indicated the
existence of a source, e.g., “show” or “insists” (Ex. 15.1,15.2). In only a few cases
was the source mentioned without a marker (Ex. 15.3).
There was,
however,
a
large variation in what cues were used,
which might explain the low results.
Sometimes there was also a distance of many tokens between the cue and the
actual
source (Ex. 15.1),
which indicates that information from a parser might
be useful for constructing features for this category. As the source of information
often consists of names, the output from a named entity recogniser might also be
useful.
Among false positives,
there were many examples where the model
had
learnt to detect typical
cues for a source,
but had not learnt in which contexts
it functions as a cue for Source.
For instance,
“report” in “The IMF is leaking
a report ...”.
This indicates that more training data,
which would allow more
examples of context, would be required in order to improve the Source-classifier.
Modifiers expressed by someone else than the author were not counted as
belonging to that modifying category.
E.g.,
“The US and some of its partners
suspect Iran of ...” should not be classified as Uncertainty, since the uncertainty
is expressed by someone else than the author.
This was a general
source of
false positives, which shows the need for a high-performing Source-classifier for
improving the other classifiers.

The model
learnt for Recommendation did not reflect the complexity with
which the category was expressed.
79% of
the true positives and 61% of
the
false positives contained versions of “should”/“must”/“need”/“have to” (Ex. 2.3,
11.1–11.2).
These expressions were,
however,
only present in 30% of
the false
negatives. Among the rest of the false negatives, around half contained specific
expressions that mark recommendation,
e.g.,
“let’s”,
“I urge” and “I suggest”,
while the rest were recommendations expressed by an imperative verb, e.g., “Stop
using it” and “Count me out”.
Using the same features and a larger training
data set might lead to that more of
the recommendation-specific expressions
will
be detected.
Features that include part-of-speech tagging might,
however,
be required for detecting recommendations expressed by an imperative verb.
The model learnt for Prediction seems to be even less complex, with 86% of
the true positives and 56% of false positives that contained versions of “will”/
“going to”. There is, however, a potential for a large complexity of a good model,
since the same frequency among false negatives was 33%, and there was a large
variety in how predictions were expressed. Contrary to the other categories that
were typically expressed by isolated chunks in the sentence, Prediction was often
expressed using several
different cues that would all
be required for the reader
(and thereby the model) to understand that the sentence contained a prediction.
This difference (Ex. 16.1-16.5) is likely to be the reason why the sentence-level
baseline classifier outperformed the chunk-based one for Prediction.
Future work includes an incorporation of some of the types of features sug-
gested here, as well as a further expansion of the training data. It would also be
possible to combine the two approaches evaluated here, by applying the output
of a chunk-based classifier as features for training the sentence-level classifier.

Conclusion
We hypothesised that stance and sentiment modifiers are mainly expressed by
local cue words, and that detection of such modifiers therefore is most suitable
to model as a chunk detection task, with the aim of detecting these cue words.
This hypothesis held true for five of
the categories studied,
but for Prediction
and Hypotheticality, better results were obtained with a sentence-level classifier
trained on tokens and bigrams present in the entire sentence.
Cluster features
derived in an unsupervised fashion were useful
for the categories Source and
Uncertainty when a subset of
the training data available was used.
When all
data available (2,095 actively selected sentences) was used, however, the effects
of
incorporating cluster features were very limited.
The analysis showed that
some types of classifier errors might be avoided by providing more training data,
and thereby more examples of
cue words and contexts that could determine
whether potential
cue words signal
the categories investigated.
For other types
of errors, however, other features and feature representations than the ones used
here might be required. Yet other types of errors would only be possible to avoid
by taking on the difficult task of incorporating pragmatic knowledge.
