Introduction.
The International
Congress of Mathematicians (ICM 2014) held
from 13-21 August 2014 in Seoul.
The main focus of this congress was the growing role
of women in the discipline and encouragement of a stronger mathematics community in
the developing countries.
The congress began with the award of
the 2014 Fields Medals.
One of
the four
recipients was the first woman to win a medal
since awards began in 1936.
She is
Maryam Mirzkhani of Standford University.
The first female president of Korea – Mrs.
Geunhye Park who presented the medals to the winners during the opening ceremony
said:
“In particular, I highly honor and admire the great spitir of challenge and passion
of Dr.
Mirzakhani, the first female to be awarded the Fields Medal in its history”.
The other three Fields Medalist are Artur Avila of the Instituto Nacional de Mathem´a-
tica Pura e Aplocada in Rio de Janeiro;
Manjul

2.
Achievements of the Fields Medalists.
Artur Avila,
35 years old,
leads and
shapes the field of
dynamical
systems.
With his collaborators he has made essential
progress in many areas, including real and complex one-dimensional dynamics, spectral
theory of the one-frequency Schr¨odinger operator, billiards and partially hyperbolic dy-
namics.
With tremendous analytical
power Avila made outstanding contributions to
dynamical
systems.
In his papers [2,
3,
4,
5]
a wide class of dynamical
systems is con-
sidered,
namely,
those arising from maps with a parabolic shape,
known as unimodal
maps and it is proved that, if one chooses such a map at random, the map will be either
regular or stochastic.
His work provides a unified, comprehensive picture of the behavior
of these systems.
This result will
be presented in Section 3.
Another important results
were proofs of long-standing conjectures, that almost every interval exchange transforma-
tion is weakly mixing.
This work is connected with the weak mixing property of regular
polygonal billiards.
Manjul Bhargava, 40 years old, has developed powerful new methods in the geometry
of numbers and applied them to count rings of small rank and to bound the average rank
of elliptic curves.
His thesis provided a reformulation of Gauss’s law or the composition
of two binary quadratic forms.
He showed that the orbits of the group
SL
(2 :
Z
)
3
on
the tensor product of three copies of the standard integral representation correspond to
quadratic rings (rings of rank 2 over
Z
) together with three ideal classes whose product
is trivial.
This recovers Gauss’s composition law in an original
and computationally
effective manner.
He then studied orbits in more complicated integral
representations,
which correspond to cubic,
quartic,
and quintic rings,
and counted the number of such
rings with bounded descriminant.
Martin Hairer,
39 years old,
has made outstanding contributions to the theory of
stochastic partial
differential
equations.
Hairer’s work addresses two central
aspects of
the theory.
Together with Mattingly he employed the Malliavin calculus along with new
methods to establish the ergodicity of
two-dimensional
stochastic Navier-Stokes equa-
tion.
Building on the rough-path approach of Lyons for stochastic ordinary differential
equations, Hairer then created an abstract theory of regularity structures for stochastic
partial differential equations (SPDE). The new theory allowed him to construct system-
atically solutions to singular nonlinear SPDEs as fixed points of renormalization proce-
dure.
Hairer was thus able to give,
for the first time,
a rigorous intrinsic meaning to
many SPDEs arising in physics.
One such problem concerning dynamical
sine-Gordon
equation [13] will be presented in Section 4 of this talk.
Maryam Mirzakhani,
37 years old,
has made striking and highly original
contribu-
tions to geometry and dynamical
systems.
Her work on Riemann surfaces and their
moduli spaces bridges several mathematical disciplines and influences them all in return.
Mirzakhani’s early work concerns closed geodesics on a hyperbolic surface.
A now-classic
theorem,
the so-called prime number theorem for geodesics,
says that the number of
closed geodesics whose length is bounded by
L
, grows exponentially with
L
; specifically,
it is asymptotic to
e
L
/L
for large
L
.
She looked at what happens to this theorem when
93
one considers only the simple closed geodesics, meaning that they do not intersect them-
selves.
The behavior is very different in this case:
the growth of the number of simple
geodesics of length at most
L
is of the order of
L
6g6
where
g
is the genus of the surface.
Mirzakhani showed that in fact the number is asymptotic to
c.L
6g6
for large
L
(going to
infinity), where the constant
c
depends only on the hyperbolic structure.
Most recently,
Mirzakhani,
together with Alex Eskin,
in part,
Amir Mohamadi,
made a major break-
through in understanding another dynamical system on moduli
space that is related to
the behavior of
geodesics in moduli
space.
Non-closed geodesics in moduli
space are
very erratic and even pathological, and it is hard to understand how they change when
perturbed slightly.
However, Mirzakhani et al.
have proved that complex geodesics and
their closures in moduli
space are in fact surprisingly regular,
rather than irregular or
fractal.
3.
Regular or stochastic dynamics in real
analytic families of
unimodal
maps.
In the works [2,
3,
4,
5]
Avila considers the dynamics of unimodal
maps of an
interval
I
, i.e., smooth endomorphisms of
I
with unique critical point that will be assumed
to be quadratic.
The simplest and most famous example of this kind is given by the real
quadratic family:
Q
λ
: [0
,
1]
→
[0
,
1]
, Q
λ
=
λx
(1
−
x
)
,
where
λ
is a real parameter between 1 and 4.
In 1976 the article of R.
May [16]
had a
big impact on the scientific community by demonstrating that this simple mathematical
model exhibits a very interesting and complex dynamical behavior.
Avila et al.
describe a picture of
an appropriate space of
real
analytical
unimodal
maps,
which gives a justification for the special
role of the quadratic family.
It is used
in order to transfer some important dynamical
properties from the quadratic family to
any non-trivial real analytic family of quasiquadratic maps (a class which includes maps
with negative Schwarzian derivative).
A unimodal map is called regular if its critical point belongs to the basin of a hyper-
bolic periodic attractor and all its periodic orbits are hyperbolic.
It is called stochastic if
it has an invariant measure absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
Given a smooth one-parameter family
{
f
t
}
of
unimodal
maps,
parameter
t
is regular
or stochastic if the corresponding map
f
t
is such.
The set of regular parameter values
is always open.
The set of stochastic parameter values has positive Lebesgue measure
for an open set of families containing the quadratic family.
In fact,
in the case of
the
quadratic family
{
Q
λ
}
much more is known:
1.
the set of regular parameter values
λ
is
open and dense in the quadratic family; 2).
the set of stochastic parameter values
λ
has
full Lebesgue measure in the complement of the regular parameters.
The main results of Avila’s work [2,3,4,5] can be formulated as follows.
Fix some
a >
0.
The affine space
A
a
has a natural involution around its real subspace
A
R
a
.
A subset in
A
a
is called
R
-symmetric if it is invariant under this involution.
Theorem 1.
Every real
hybrid class
H
R
f
,
f
∈ U
a
,
is an embedded codimension-
one real
analytic Banach submanifold of
U
a
.
Furthermore, the hybrid classes laminate a
neighborhood of any non-parabolic map
f
∈ U
a
.
More precisely,
any non-parabolic map
f
∈ U
a
has an R-symmetric neighborhood
ν
in the complex affine space
A
a
endowed with
a codimension-one R-symmetric holomorphic lamination such that for any
g
∈
ν
∩ U
R
a
,
the intersection of the leaf through
g
with
A
R
a
coincides with
H
R
g
∩
ν
.
94
A real analytic one-parameter family
{
f
λ
}
λ∈Λ
of quasiquadratic maps is called non-
trivial if it is not contained in a single real hybrid case.
Theorem 2. Let
{
f
λ
}
λ∈Λ
⊂ U
a
be a non-trivial
one-parameter real
analytic family of
quasiquadratic maps.
Then for almost all
parameter values
λ
∈
Λ
, the map
f
λ
is either
regular or stochastic.
This theorem extends the following result by Kozlovski [14]:
For an open and dense
set of
parameter values
t
in a non-trivial
real
analytic family
{
f
t
}
,
the map
f
t
has a
finite number of periodic attractors whose basin has full Lebesgue measure.
Theorem 2
fits nicely to the general
program of studying attractors in finite parameter families of
dynamical systems (in all dimensions) formulated by Palis [17, 18].
Theorem 3. Under the circumstances of the previous theorem, there is an open and
dense set
Λ
0
⊂
Λ
of parameter values with countable complement such that the straight-
ening map
χ
(
f
t
)
is quasisymmetric on any compact interval
contained in
Λ
0
.
Though these results are concerned with real unimodal maps, they are mostly based
on the complex methods.
The complex tools which are particuarly important for the
results are the theory of holomorphic motions and the Pullback Argument, especially, its
infinitesimal version.
It allows to carry out an infinitesimal analysis of topological classes
of unimodal
maps which yields the following problem:
Is it true that codimension-one
topological classes form a lamination in the space of quasiquadratic maps (near parabolic
maps as well)?
The main results in [2, 3, 4, 5] are still valid without the negative Schwarzian derivative
assumption.
The regular or stochastic dichotomy in families of
unimodal
maps has
been recently refined,
giving a better statistical
description of
the dynamics of
typical
parameters:
they satisfy the Collet-Eckmann condition,
among other nice properties.
Those results, first obtained in the context of the quadratic family [3],
is generalized in
[4], [2] to non-trivial analytic families using the above stated results and then to generic
smooth families.
4. Dynamical sine-Gordon equation.
The aim of this work is to provide a solution
theory for the stochastic PDE:
(1)
∂
t
u
=
1
2
∆
u
+
c
sin(
βu
+ Θ) +
ξ,
where
c
,
β
, Θ are real valued constants,
ξ
denotes space-time white noise, and the spatial
dimension is fixed to be 2.
The model (1) is interesting for a number of reasons.
First and foremost, it is of purely
mathematical interest as a very nice testbed for renormalisation techniques.
Indeed, even
though the authors work with fixed spatial dimension 2, this model exhibits many features
comparable to those of various models arising in constructive quantum field theory (QFT)
and/or statistical mechanics, but with the dimension
d
of those models being a function
of the parameter
β
.
More precisely,
at least at a heuristic level,
(1) is comparable to Φ
3
d
Euclidean QFT
with
d
= 2 +
β
2
2π
, Φ
4
d
Euclidean QFT with
d
= 2 +
β
2
4π
, or the KPZ equation in dimension
d
=
β
2
4π
.
In particular, one encounters divergencies when trying to define solutions to (1)
or any of the models just mentioned as soon as
β
is nonzero.
(In the case of the KPZ
equation recall that,
via the Cole-Hopf transform it is equivalent to the stochastic heat
95
equation.
In dimension 0, this reduces to the SDE
du
=
udW
which is ill-posed if
W
is
a Wiener process but is well-posed as soon as it is replaced by something more regular,
say fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter greater than 1/2.)
These divergencies can however be cured in all of these models by Wick renormalisa-
tion as long as
β
2
<
4
π
.
At
β
2
= 4
π
(corresponding to Φ
3
4
,
Φ
4
3
,
and KPZ in dimension
1), Wick renormalisation breaks down and higher order renormalisation schemes need to
be introduced.
One still
expects the theory to be renormalisable until
β
2
= 8
π
,
which
corresponds to Φ
3
6
, Φ
4
4
and KPZ in dimension 2, at which point renormalisability breaks
down.
This suggests that the value
β
2
= 8
π
is critical for (1) and that there is no hope
to give it any non-trivial meaning beyond that, see for example [8, 10] and, in a slightly
different context,
[15].
This heuristic (including the fact that Wick renormalisability
breaks down at
β
2
= 4
π
) is well-known and has been demonstrated in [6,
8,
11]
at the
level of the behaviour of the partition function for the corresponding lattice model.
From a more physical
perspective,
an interesting feature of
(1) is that it is closely
related to models of
a globally neutral
gas of
interacting charges.
With this interpre-
tation,
the gas forms a plasma at high temperature (low
β
) and the various threshold
values for
β
could be interpreted as threshold of formation of macroscopic fractions of
dipoles/quadrupoles/etc.
The critical value
β
2
= 8
π
can be interpreted as the critical in-
verse temperature at which total collapse takes place, giving rise to a Kosterlitz-Thouless
phase transition.
Finally,
the model
(1) has also been proposed as a model
for the dy-
namic of
crystalvapour interfaces at the roughening transition [7]
and as a model
of
crystal surface fluctuations in equilibrium.
In order to give a non-trivial meaning to (1), the authors first replace
ξ
by a smoothened
version
ξ
ε
which has a correlation length of order
ε >
0 and then study the limit
ε
→
0.
Since the authors are working in two space dimensions,
one expects the solution to be-
come singular (distribution-valued) as
ε
→
0.
As a consequence,
there will
be some
“averaging effect” so that one expects to have sin(
βu
ε
)
→
0 in some weak sense as
ε
→
0.
It therefore seems intuitively clear that if the authors wish to obtain a nontrivial
limit,
they should simultaneously send the constant
c
to +
∞
.
This is indeed the case,
see Theorem 1 below.
The authors also study a class of 2 + 1-dimensional equilibrium
interface fluctuation models with more general periodic nonlinearities:
(2)
∂
t
u
ε
=
1
2
∆
u
ε
+
c
ε
F
β
(
u
ε
) +
ξ
ε
,
where
F
β
is a trigonometric polynomial of the form:
(3)
F
β
=
Z
X
k=1
ζ
k
sin(
kβu
+ Θ
k
)
, Z
∈
N
,
where
ζ
k
,
β
and Θ
k
are real
valued constants.
One may expect that the “averaging
effect” of sin(
kβu
ε
+Θ
k
) is stronger for larger values of
k
.
This is indeed the case and, as
a consequence of this, that provided the constant
c
ε
→ ∞
at a proper rate, the limiting
process obtained as
ε
→
0 only depends on
F
β
via the values
β
, Θ
1
and
ζ
1
.
In this sense,
the equation (1) also arises as the limit of the models (2).
The main result can be formulated as follows.
Theorem 4. Let
0
< β
2
<
16π
3
and
η
∈
(
−
1
3
,
0)
.
For
u
(0)
∈ C
η
(
T
2
)
fixed,
consider
96
the solution
u
ε
to
∂
t
u
ε
=
1
2
∆
u
ε
+
C
ρ
ε
−β
2
/4π
F
β
(
u
ε
) +
ξ
ε
, u
(0
, .
) =
u
(0)
,
where
F
β
is defined in
(3)
,
ξ
ε
=
ρ
ε
∗
ξ
with
ρ
ε
(
t, x
) =
ε
−4
ρ
(
ε
−2
t, ε
−1
x
)
for some smooth
and compactly supported function
ρ
integrating to 1.
Then there exists a constant
C
ρ
(depending only on
β
and the mollifier
ρ
) such that the sequence
u
ε
converges in proba-
bility to a limiting distributional
process u which is independent of
ρ
.
More precisely,
there exist
random variables
τ
>
0
and
u
∈ D
′
(
R
+
×
T
2
)
such
that,
for every
T
′
> T >
0
,
the natural
restriction of
u
to
D
′
((0
, T
)
×
T
2
)
belongs
to
χ
T,η
=
C
([0
, T
]
,
C
η
(
T
))
on the set
τ
≥
T
′
.
Furthermore,
on the same set,
one has
u
ε
→
u
in probability in the topology of
χ
T,η
.
Finally,
one has
lim
t→τ
||
u
(
t, .
)
||
C
η
(T
2
)
=
∞
on the set
τ <
∞
.
The limiting process
u depends on the numerical
values
β
,
ζ
1
, and
Θ
1
, but it depends neither on the choice of
mollifier
ρ
, nor on the numerical
values
ζ
k
and
Θ
k
for
k
≥
2
.
As already mentioned, one expects the boundary
β
2
=
16π
3
to be artificial and a similar
result is expected to hold for any
β
2
∈
(0
,
8
π
).
In fact,
8
π
is the natural
boundary for
the method of proof
developed in [13]
and employed here.
However,
as
β
2
→
8
π
,
the
theory requires proofs of convergence of more and more auxiliary objects.
In the current
context, unfortunately there is not general convergence result for all of these objects but
instead all
of them have to be treated separately “by hand”.
Furthermore,
the bounds
on the simplest “second-order” object unfortunately appear to break down at
β
2
= 6
π
.
It is interesting to note that for
β
2
∈
(0
,
4
π
),
one auxiliary process have to be con-
structed, and this construction does indeed involve a careful tracking of cancellations due
to the grouping of terms into “dipoles”, while for
β
2
∈
[4
π,
16π
3
), a second auxiliary pro-
cess should be built which requires to keep track of cancellations obtained by considering
“quadrupoles”.
The limiting process
u
is a continuous function of time,
taking values in a suitable
space of spatial distributions.
Regarding the right hand side of the equation however, it
only makes sense as a random distribution at fixed time when
β
2
<
4
π
.
For
β
2
≥
4
π
however, it exists only as a random space-time distribution.
The article [1] appears in principle to cover (1) as part of a larger class of nonlinearities.
It is however unclear what the meaning of the solutions constructed there is and how
they relate to the construction given in the present article.
The interpretation of
the
solutions in [1]
is that of a random Colombeau generalised function and it is not clear
at all whether this generalised function represents an actual distribution.
In particular,
the construction given there is completely impervious to the presence of the Kosterlitz-
Thouless transition and the collapse of multipoles which clearly transpire in our analysis.
