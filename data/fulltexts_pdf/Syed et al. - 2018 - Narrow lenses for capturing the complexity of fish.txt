Abstract
Despite increased fisheries science output and publication outlets, the global crisis in 
fisheries management is as present as ever. Since a narrow research focus may be a 
contributing factor to this failure, this study uncovers topics in fisheries research and 
their trends over time. This interdisciplinary research evaluates whether science is di-
versifying fisheries research topics in an attempt to capture the complexity of the 
fisheries system, or whether it is multiplying research on similar topics, attempting to 
achieve an in- depth, but possibly marginal, understanding of a few selected compo-
nents of this system. By utilizing latent Dirichlet allocation as a generative probabilistic 
topic model, we analyse a unique dataset consisting of 46,582 full- text articles pub-
lished in the last 26 years in 21 specialized scientific fisheries journals. Among the 25 
topics uncovered by the model, only one (Fisheries management) refers to the human 
dimension of fisheries understood as socio- ecological complex adaptive systems. The 
most prevalent topics in our dataset directly relating to fisheries refer to Fisheries 
management, Stock assessment, and Fishing gear, with Fisheries management attract-
ing the most interest. We propose directions for future research focus that most likely 
could contribute to providing useful advice for successful management of fisheries.

1 | INTRODUC TION
Following a similar trend to scientific research at large, fisheries sci-
ence research output has significantly increased in the last three 
decades (Aksnes & Browman, 2016), in parallel with an increase 
in the number of fisheries scientific journals (Mather, Parrish, & 
Dettmers, 2008). This rapid expansion of the field is attributed to 
the growing concern about the state of global fish stocks and to the 
major role that science has been playing in fisheries management 
(Jarić, Cvijanović, Knežević- Jarić, & Lenhardt, 2012). However, de-
spite the increased volume of fisheries science output and publica-
tion outlets, the global crisis in marine capture fisheries management 
is as present as ever, with unforeseen consequences ranging from 
fisheries- induced evolutionary changes among wild fish populations 
(Belgrano & Fowler, 2013) to conflicts between states over the im-
plementation of best available science (Brooks et al., 2016). There 
are various hypotheses regarding causes and contributing factors 
for failures of fisheries management, including data uncertainty, 
model inadequacy, ecosystem structure, institutional efficacy, eco-
nomic discord or research focus (Smith & Link, 2005). Among these, 
research focus is the least explored (Smith & Link, 2005). Using 
hybrid content analysis of a unique dataset consisting of 46,582 
fisheries science full- text articles published in the last 26 years, we 
uncover focus topics in fisheries research and their trends.

Fisheries 
are 
a 
socio- ecological 
complex 
adaptive 
system 
(SECAS) in which macroscopic properties emerge from local ac-
tions that spread to higher scales due to agents’ (fish and humans) 
collective behaviour; these properties then feed back, in a nonlin-
ear way, influencing individuals’ options and behaviours, but they 
typically only do so diffusely and over long timescales (Levin et al., 
2013; Ostrom, 2009). A fishery can be defined as “the complex 
of people, their institutions, their harvest and their observations 
associated with and including a targeted stock or group of stocks 
(i.e. usually fish), and increasingly, the associated ecosystems that 
produce said stocks” (Link, 2010). Deconstructing the concept, 
the two main dimensions of a fishery are the human dimension 
(i.e. human agents, communities of these and their institutions) 
and the natural dimension (i.e. biotic, such as predator species 
and prey species, and abiotic, such as water temperature and 
nutrients) (Charles, 2001; Lennox et al., 2017; Österblom et al., 
2013). The purpose of this study was to assess whether fisheries 
science output is reflecting this conceptual diversity of fisheries 
as SECAS, and if so, to what extent. Is science diversifying fish-
eries research topics in an attempt to capture the complexity of 
the fisheries system, or is it multiplying research on similar topics, 
trying to achieve an in- depth, but possibly marginal, understand-
ing of a few selected components of this system? Based on the 
critical reflection that “the majority of fisheries scientists have a 
biologically oriented background, they can be a bit naïve regard-
ing other factors when it comes to the prominence of economic or 
social considerations” (Link, 2010), the working hypothesis of this 
study is that the human dimension of fisheries might be under- 
represented in the fisheries specialty literature.
The assessments of the development and trends in fisheries sci-
ence have so far been mostly based on reviews (e.g. Johnson et al., 
2013) or bibliometric evaluations (e.g. Aksnes & Browman, 2016) 
of scientific publications in the field. Limitations of these stud-
ies include the following: taking into account only a limited num-
ber of publications (e.g. Jarić et al., 2012), or a limited time period 
(e.g. 2000–09; Jarić et al., 2012); having a limited scope [e.g. arti-
sanal coral reef fisheries research (Johnson et al., 2013); fish stock 
assessment research (Kumaresan, Ezhilrani, Vinitha, Sivaraman, & 
Jayaraman, 2014); shark by- catch research (Molina & Cooke, 2012)]; 
using proxies for full- text articles [e.g. titles (Jarić et al., 2012); ab-
stracts (Aksnes & Browman, 2016)], or proxies for topics of research 
[e.g. one word per topic (Aksnes & Browman, 2016; Jarić et al., 
2012)]. Most importantly, all these previous attempts to map the 
fisheries science field are top- down approaches, with topics of inter-
est manually predefined by the analysts [e.g. species, region, habitat, 
study object (Jarić et al., 2012)], and the analysed data manually as-
signed to these topics. However, such approaches are limited due to 
the subjectivity inherent in human decisions, and the analysis of the 
same research field could yield opposite results (e.g. Rose, Janiger, 
Parsons, and Stachowitsch (2011) vs. Hill and Lackups (2010) evalu-
ation of the field of cetacean research).
In contrast to previous approaches, we follow a completely novel 
strategy for the field of fisheries science, a bottom- up approach 
(Debortoli, Müller, Junglas, & vom Brocke, 2016) by utilizing topic 
modelling to uncover hidden research topics within fisheries science 
publications. Topic modelling algorithms are machine- learning meth-
ods to automatically uncover hidden or latent thematic structures 
from large collections of documents. Topic models can produce a set 
of interpretable topics that can be viewed as groups of co- occurring 
words that are associated with a single topic or theme (DiMaggio, 
Nag, & Blei, 2013). Such groups of co- occurring words (i.e. topics) 
are words that tend to come up together within the same linguistic 
context more frequently than one would expect by chance alone. 
These co- occurring words tend to purport similar meaning and refer 
to a similar subject. For example, in the context of fisheries science, 
an author might write a text to which she/he gave the keywords 
“community structure,” “subtropical areas,” “reference points” and 
“weight.” This text might use more frequently the words “parame-
ters,” “estimation,” “stock,” “modeling,” “male,” “female,” “sex” and 
“spawning.” If we wanted to use topic modelling to uncover the latent 
topics of this hypothetical text, based on how often these most used 
words would appear together (i.e. co- occur), the automated topic 
model would group the first four words in one topic and the last four 
words in a different topic. These two topics would then be manually 
labelled by a domain expert most likely as Stock assessment model-
ing and Reproduction, respectively. Note that the subject of these 
two topics is not similar to the one that might be inferred from the

keywords given to this hypothetical text. Thus, these topics are la-
tent, and they are hidden in the pattern of co- occurring words. In 
essence, topic models are able to exploit the co- occurrence struc-
ture of texts and produce the topics as lists of words that frequently 
come up together, within and between documents; technically, such 
lists of words are probability distributions over words.
The topics emerge from the statistical properties of the docu-
ments and, thus, overcome the need for manual annotation of the 
collection of texts, although manual interpretation of the subject 
of a topic might still be needed, as it is yet considered the gold 
standard in the domain of topic modelling (Lau, Grieser, Newman, 
& Baldwin, 2011). As such, we allow the documents to speak for 
themselves and view the documents through the computational 
lens of the topic model, rather than relying on the manifest or re-
ported content by their authors. Document collections that are 
too large to explore manually can now be analysed to study phe-
nomena of the sort that can only be viewed through the macro-
scopic computational lens of the topic model (Mohr & Bogdanov, 
2013). Topic modelling approaches have been helpful in elucidat-
ing the key ideas within a set of documents, such as articles pub-
lished in the journal PNAS (Griffiths & Steyvers, 2004), political 
science texts (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013) or data- driven journalism 
(Rusch, Hofmarcher, Hatzinger, & Hornik, 2013). Moreover, it is 
considered that this approach could provide insight into the devel-
opment of a scientific field and changes in research priorities (Neff 
& Corley, 2009) and could do so with greater speed and quantita-
tive rigour than would otherwise be possible through traditional 
narrative reviews (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013). As such, this topic 
modelling method has been applied, for example, in the domain 
of transportation research (Sun & Yin, 2017), computer science 
(Hall, Jurafsky, & Manning, 2008; Wang & McCallum, 2006; Wang, 
Paisley, & Blei, 2011), fisheries modelling (Syed & Weber, 2018), 
conservation science (Westgate, Barton, Pierson, & Lindenmayer, 
2015) and the fields of operations research and management sci-
ence (Gatti, Brooks, & Nurre, 2015).
After identifying the hidden topics of fisheries science, we 
analyse the extent to which these topics cover the complexity of 
the fisheries domain. Afterwards, we examine topic similarity, topic 
co- occurrence, topic prevalence and topical trends over the last 
26 years. We furthermore identify patterns in increasing and de-
creasing topic trends over specific periods of time (i.e. hot and cold 
topics in 1990–95, 1995–2000, 2000–05, 2005–10 and 2010–16) 
and describe the distribution of uncovered topics over journals.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Latent Dirichlet allocation
This paper utilizes the topic model latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) 
(Blei, 2012; Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003). LDA is a Bayesian probabilis-
tic topic model and follows the assumption that documents exhibit 
multiple topics in mixing proportions, thus capturing the heteroge-
neity of, for example, research topics within scientific publications. 
In statistics, this is often referred to as a mixed- membership model 
(Erosheva, Fienberg, & Lafferty, 2004). Technically, a topic is a 
multinomial distribution of words in the vocabulary, where each 
word has a different probability within each topic; within a topic, 
more prominent words have a higher probability and groups of 
high probability words can be considered as co- occurring clusters 
or constellation of words that describe a certain underlying topic 
or theme. A document might be 60% about the topic Fisheries 
management and 40% about the topic Stock assessment. A topic 
“about” a subject (e.g. fisheries management) relates to the prob-
ability distribution of words that places high probability to words 
that would be used to describe the subject (DiMaggio et al., 2013). 
Note that the underlying topics and to what extent the document 
exhibits these topics are not known in advance. These details are 
the output of the LDA analysis and emerge automatically from the 
statistical properties of the documents and the assumptions be-
hind LDA.
One way to think about LDA is to imagine a document in which 
one highlights words with coloured markers. Words that relate to 
one topic are coloured blue, words that relate to another topic are 
coloured red and so on. After all of the words have been coloured 
(excluding words such as “the,” “a”), all the words with the same co-
lour are the topics, and the article will blend the colours in different 
proportions. Different documents will have different blends of co-
lours, and we could use the proportion of the various colours to situ-
ate this specific document in a document collection (e.g. documents 
addressing mainly the blue topic). Moreover, documents with the 
same blend of colours discuss the topics in similar proportion and are 
considered closely related from a topical perspective. Technically, 
documents with similar topic distributions are close in Kullback–
Leibler divergence, a measure to calculate the distance between two 
probability distributions. LDA as a statistical model captures this in-
tuition. We refer the interested reader to Blei (2012) for a concise 
introduction to LDA.
Latent Dirichlet allocation is best described by its generative 
process, that is the imaginary probabilistic recipe that generates 
the documents as well as the hidden structure. The hidden struc-
ture is the topics, modelled as distributions of words, and the topic 
proportions per document, where each document has some prob-
ability for each latent topic (i.e. mixing topic proportions). More 
formally, the generative process also assigns each word to a topic 
as to allow for documents to exhibit multiple topics, analogous to 
the coloured words example. More information on the generative 
process can be found in the supplementary material. Given the ob-
served documents, the aim now is to infer the hidden structure 
to answer the question “what is the likely hidden topical structure 
that has generated these documents?”, a process that can be seen 
as reverse- engineering the generative process. Technically, we 
want to infer the posterior distribution of the latent variables given 
the observed documents. An analogy to this process is described 
by the local farmers’ market example; one might estimate what 
vegetables and what quantities are being sold at the local farm-
ers’ market by post hoc inspection of people’s shopping basket.

Seeing more baskets refines the estimation of the products and 
their quantities and provides an estimate of the market’s produce 
(Rhody, 2012). Mainly two types of inference techniques can be 
discerned: 
sampling- based 
algorithms 
(e.g. 
Newman, 
Asuncion, 
Smyth, & Welling, 2007; Porteous et al., 2008) and variational- 
based algorithms (e.g. Blei & Jordan, 2006; Teh, Newman, Welling, 
& Neaman, 2006; Wang et al., 2011). To simplify posterior infer-
ence, LDA uses a Dirichlet distribution as a conjugate prior for 
the multinomial distribution, hence the name LDA. The posterior 
distribution will reveal the probability distributions of words for 
each topic and the topic proportions per document. Note that the 
obtained structure is latent, and therefore, the probability distri-
butions of words are not semantically labelled. However, when 
sorted, the words with the highest probability within a topic will re-
late to what one would call a topic or theme (DiMaggio et al., 2013; 
Mohr & Bogdanov, 2013). In this context, it is important to mention 
that the LDA model does not give a name to each identified latent 
topic (i.e. the model does not label the topics). The output of the 
model groups the co- occurring words under numbered topics (i.e. 
topic 1, topic 2, topic 3). Albeit a subjective endeavour, possibly 
affecting the statistical objectiveness of the LDA method, in order 
to increase the readability and interpretability of these topics, a 
human analyst can be used to interpret what is the common sub-
ject of the words within each topic and consequently give a name 
(i.e. a post hoc label) to this topic (DiMaggio et al., 2013). Research 
into automatic assignment of topic labels exists; however, manual 
annotation by a human expert is still considered the gold standard 
in labelling topics (Lau et al., 2011). For our study, instead of using 
the topic numbering provided by the LDA model (i.e. topic 1, topic 
2, topic 3), in order to increase readability of the text and inter-
pretability of results, we chose to give a specific label to each topic 
using the gold standard in this domain, that is manual annotation 
(see the section Labelling topics).
2.2 | Assumptions behind LDA
Latent Dirichlet allocation is a bag- of- words model in which docu-
ments are represented as unordered sequences of words. Such an 
assumption neglects word order and possibly important cues to 
the content of a document (Steyvers & Griffiths, 2007). Although 
an unrealistic assumption, it is reasonable when uncovering se-
mantic structures of text (Blei, 2012; Blei & Lafferty, 2006). 
Consider a thought experiment where the words of a document 
are shuffled. After finding a high number of words like spawning, 
eggs and growth, one can imagine that the document deals with 
some aspects of reproduction. LDA further assumes document 
exchangeability, that is, the order in which documents are ana-
lysed is unimportant, yet all documents are analysed at the end of 
the LDA analysis. Consequently, LDA is unable to explicitly cap-
ture evolving topics from documents that cover large time spans 
(e.g. centuries). To do that, we would need to resort to a more 
complicated and computationally expensive dynamic topic model 
(Blei & Lafferty, 2006). Such an approach is currently not feasible 
given the large dataset used here, but would be interesting to ex-
plore in future work. Nevertheless, the assumption of document 
exchangeability captures the fact that current literature builds on 
top of previous literature, but is a limitation for topics that have 
radically changed in the way they are described (e.g. terminol-
ogy) in literature. For example, the field of atomic physics was 
described by words relating to “matter” in the late 19th century, 
“electron” in middle of the 20th century and “quantum” in the late 
20th century. Likewise, the field of neuroscience evolved from 
being described by words relating to “nerve,” to “neuron,” to “ca2” 
over the last 100 years (Blei & Lafferty, 2006). The dynamic topic 
model uses a sequence of time slices in which topics are condi-
tioned on the previous topics, which is a limitation of the standard 
LDA model used in this study.
2.3 | Creating the data set
Taking into consideration the issue of having access to the elec-
tronic version of the text, we decided to include in our analysis 
only journal articles, as the majority of these are now available for 
download from online databases. Thus, we have excluded books, 
books chapters and reports, something that may have introduced 
bias in our results. Furthermore, due to computational and time 
constraints, we have limited the number of journals included in 
our analysis. Thus, the total volume of fisheries publications is un-
derestimated in our analysis, something that limits the results of 
this study. The dataset was constructed following a set of inclu-
sion criteria to obtain a diverse set of journals that reflect fish-
eries science while maintaining computational feasibility. First, 
we included all journals with the term “fisheries” or “fishery” in 
their title that are listed by the Fisheries Science Citation Index 
Extended (SCIE) 2016 provided by Thomson Reuters and having 
an impact factor of ≥1.0. Second, we included all journals from 
the Fisheries SCIE 2016 that do not include these words in their 
titles, but explicitly address fisheries in their aims and scopes, and 
having an impact factor of ≥1.0. Third, we included the top four 
journals with the highest 2016 impact factor with the term “ma-
rine” in their title, indexed by any list from SCIE or Social Science 
Citation Index, and explicitly addressing fisheries in their aims and 
scopes. All journals were subject to the University of Tromsø—The 
Arctic University of Norway subscription rights. A total of 21 jour-
nals satisfied these criteria (Table 1). Although journals that do not 
match these criteria also publish fisheries research, such journals 
were not considered to be specialized fisheries research outlets 
(e.g. the journal Ecology and Society).
Moreover, even though some of the most influential and highly 
cited fisheries papers are published in high- impact journals such 
as Nature and Science, they only marginally contribute to the total 
number of papers published in fisheries- related journals. Including 
in our analysis all publications from Nature and Science would result 
in a high number of fisheries- irrelevant topics (e.g. astrophysics), as 
these journals typically publish a broad range of topics. Using key-
word searches to obtain only fisheries- related publications would be

terms used and (ii) the way publications are indexed and, subse-
quently, retrieved.
We downloaded full- text research articles published in the 
21 journals covering fisheries aspects for a time span of 26 years 
(1990–2016) to allow for enough variation in publication trends. 
Analysing full- text articles, compared to just abstract data, results 
in more detailed and higher quality topics (Syed & Spruit, 2017). 
Only research articles were considered, and other types of publi-
cations, such as errata, conference reports, forewords, announce-
ments, dedications, letters, comments, and book reviews, were 
excluded. A total of 46,582 articles were deemed fit for further 
analysis. The year of publication was chosen to be the issue year in 
which the article appeared in print, regardless of the accepted year 
or (first) online publication. Information about the journal name, the 
time range for which articles were collected, the journal’s impact 
factor, the total number of articles deemed fit for further analysis 
and word statistics are given in Table 1. Additionally, an overview of 
the number of publications per journal per year is shown in Figure 1. 
Not all journals provided articles for the complete time span of 
26 years. For example, the journal Fish and Fisheries started in 2000 
and, therefore, only articles from 2000 to 2016 were included in the 
study. Another example relates to the journal subscription rights, 
which did not allow data collection for all years. For example, the 
Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences started in 1901, 
but our subscription only allowed access from 1996.
All articles appeared in portable document format (PDF) and were 
first converted to their plain text representation. This resulted in a 
complete transformation from PDF to plain text for all elements of 
each article, including the header, title, author info, affiliation info, ab-
stract, keywords, content, tables, bibliography and captions. Several 
articles, mainly from the early 1990s, were image- based PDFs that 
were unsuitable for direct conversion from PDF to plain text. In these 
cases, the Tesseract optical character recognition (OCR) software 
library was used to subsequently convert these articles into text- 
based PDFs and then to their plain text representation. To make sure 
that we only analysed the content text of each article, we used an 
advanced text pattern search method to remove boilerplate content 
such as journal information, article metadata, acknowledgments and 
bibliographies. Additionally, multilanguage abstracts or non- 
English 
articles (e.g. articles that appeared in French) were also removed.
Latent Dirichlet allocation is a bag- of- words model in which doc-
uments are represented as sequences of individual word features. As 
such, every document was tokenized. Tokenization is the process of 
obtaining individual words (also known as unigrams) from sentences. 
Unigrams lose important semantic cues that are encoded by com-
pound words. To overcome this, bigrams were included by combin-
ing two consecutive unigrams that occurred ≥20 times within each 
document. As a result, compound words, such as “rainbow trout,” are 
preserved. Additionally, we used named entity recognition (NER), a 
technique from natural language processing (NLP), to retrieve en-
tities related to names, nationalities, companies, locations, objects 
etc., from the documents. Entities such as “the European Union,” 
“the Norwegian Research Council” or “marine protected areas” are 
thus preserved and included in the analysis. The inclusion of bigrams 
and entities allows for a richer bag- of- words representation than a 
standard unigram representation.
Although 
all 
tokens 
within 
a 
document 
serve 
an 
important 
function, for topic modelling they are not all equally important. We 
proceed by filtering out numbers, punctuation marks and single- 
character words as they bear no topical meaning. Furthermore, 
we removed stop words (e.g. the, is, a, which), words that occurred 
only once (e.g. mainly typos and incorrectly hyphenated words) and 
words that occurred in ≥90% of the documents (e.g. result, study, 
show) as they serve no discriminative topical significance. Omitting 
frequently occurring words prevents such words from dominating 
all topics.
For grammatical reasons, different word forms or derivationally 
related words can have a similar meaning and, ideally, we would want 
such terms to be grouped. Stemming and lemmatization are two NLP 
techniques to reduce inflectional and derivational forms of words to 
a common base form. Stemming heuristically cuts off derivational 
affixes to achieve some normalization, albeit crude in most cases. 
Stemming loses the ability to relate stemmed words back to their

original part of speech, such as verbs or nouns, and decreases the 
interpretability of topics in later stages (Evangelopoulos, Zhang, & 
Prybutok, 2012). For example, the term “fishing” will be stemmed to 
“fish”; likewise, “modeling” will be stemmed to “model” and cannot 
be returned to its original part of speech (i.e. verb). Our analysis uses 
lemmatization, which is a more sophisticated normalization method 
that uses a vocabulary and morphological analysis to reduce words 
to their base form, called lemma. It is best described by its most basic 
example, normalizing the verbs “am,” “are,” “is” to “be,” although such 
terms will be filtered out from our analysis. Likewise, lemmatization 
correctly normalizes “fisheries” and “fishery,” and “policies” and “pol-
icy.” Additionally, uppercase and lowercase words were grouped. 
The final corpus consisted of 46,582 full- text publications with 
around 130 million words and 170,000 unique words.
2.4 | Creating the LDA model
Latent Dirichlet allocation assumes that the number of topics to 
uncover is known in advance and is set by the K- parameter. As the 
optimal number of topics is not known in advance, we created 50 
different LDA models by varying the K- parameter from 1 to 50. 
Measures to determine the optimal LDA model are described in the 
next section. The LDA models are created using the Python library 
Gensim (Rehurek & Sojka, 2010). Since LDA is a Bayesian probabilis-
tic model, we can incorporate some prior knowledge into the model. 
Prior knowledge can be encoded by symmetrical or asymmetrical 
Dirichlet priors. A symmetrical prior distribution of topics within 
documents assumes that all topics have an equal probability of being 
assigned to a document. Such an assumption ignores that certain 
topics are more prominent in a document collection and, conse-
quently, would logically have a higher probability to be assigned to 
a document. Conversely, specific topics are less common and, thus, 
not appropriately reflected with a symmetrical prior distribution. 
Logically speaking, an asymmetrical prior would capture this intui-
tion and would, therefore, be the preferred choice (Syed & Spruit, 
2018; Wallach, Mimno, & Mccallum, 2009). Additionally, we itera-
tively optimize the prior using the Newton–Rapson method (Huang, 
2005) by learning it from the data. To infer the hidden variables (i.e. 
inferring the posterior distribution of the hidden variables given the 
observed documents), we use variational inference called “online 
LDA” (Hoffman, Blei, & Bach, 2010).
2.5 | Calculating model quality
Analogous to choosing the right number of clusters for techniques 
such as k- nearest neighbours, choosing the right number topics is an 
important task in topic modelling, including LDA, to appropriately 
capture the underlying topics in a dataset. A low number of topics 
will result in a few too broad topics, with high values capturing mean-
ingless topics; such topics are merely the result of the statistical na-
ture of LDA. Several approaches to determine the optimal number of 
topics have been proposed. One such approach is to fit various topic 
models to a training set of documents and calculate a model fit on a 
test set (held- out data) (Scott & Baldridge, 2013). The model that fits 
best on the test set would be considered a better model. However, 
topic models are used by humans to interpret and explore the docu-
ments, and there is no technical reason that the best- fitted model 
would aid best in this task (Blei, 2012). In fact, research has shown 
that such measures negatively correlate with human interpretation 
(Chang, Gerrish, Wang, & Blei, 2009).
Another approach is to assess the quality of topics with human 
topic ranking, which is considered the gold standard when assess-
ing the interpretability of generated topics. Such ranking is often 
based on word or topic intrusion tests, in which an intruder word 
or topic needs to be recognized within a set of related or cohesive 
words or topics (Chang et al., 2009). However, this approach is time- 
consuming and expensive as for every created topic model (e.g. 
1–50), and for every topic within that model, the interpretability of 
individual words and sets of words needs to be assessed. To circum-
vent this, a more quantitative approach is preferred while maintain-
ing human interpretability. One way is to assess the quality of topics 
with coherence measures that are based on the distributional hy-
pothesis (Harris, 1954), which states that words with similar mean-
ings tend to co- occur within similar contexts. Such an approach, 
drawing on the philosophical premise that a set of statements or 
facts is said to be coherent if its statements or facts support each 
other, informs us about the understandability and interpretability of 
topics from a human perspective. This study utilized the C
V
coher-
ence measure (Röder, Both, & Hinneburg, 2015), which has shown 
the highest correlation with all available human topic ranking data, 
and is thus an appropriate quantitative approach (see supplementary 
material for an extensive and mathematical explanation of the C
V
coherence measure). The C
V
coherence score for all 50 LDA mod-
els was calculated and an elbow method, estimating the (inflection) 
point where adding more topics will not increase coherence, was 
used to obtain the optimal number of topics.
2.6 | Labelling topics
As previously described, the topical structure that permeates the doc-
ument collection is latent, and the probability distributions of words 
(i.e. topics) are not semantically labelled (i.e. they are not given a name 
by the LDA model). When sorted, the top 10 or top 15 high probabil-
ity words within each topic are used to describe the topic. However, 
algorithmic analyses of content remain limited in their capacity to un-
derstand latent meanings or the subtleties of human language (Lewis, 
Zamith, & Hermida, 2013) and manual labelling is still considered the 
gold standard in topic modelling (Lau et al., 2011). Thus, the labelling 
of each topic (i.e. giving a name to each topic; e.g. a topic with the 
five most probable words being “pig,” “cow,” “sheep,” “goat,” “horse” 
would be labelled as “domestic animals”) was performed by a human 
analyst, that is a fisheries domain expert. When identifying the com-
mon subject of each topic (i.e. the name or the label of the topic), 
the analyst used the following procedure. First, the analyst closely 
inspected the 15 most probable words from each topic. Second, the 
analyst inspected the titles of the documents in the dataset that were 
650

.
included by the topic model in that respective topic. The interested 
reader can find a sample of publication titles that have high prob-
ability within a single topic in Table S1 of the supplementary mate-
rial. Third, based on the previous two steps, the analyst labelled a 
topic (i.e. gave it a name; e.g., if the LDA model included in topic 1 the 
words “pig,” “cow,” “farm” and the titles of the documents included 
by the model in this topic have in common the subject of domestic 
animals, then the analyst gave topic 1 the label of “domestic animals”). 
Furthermore, to validate the labelling of the topics, we visualized the 
topics in a two- dimensional area by computing the distance between 
topics (Chuang, Ramage, Manning, & Heer, 2012) and applying mul-
tidimensional scaling (Sievert & Shirley, 2014). This two- dimensional 
topic representation displays the similarity between topics with re-
spect to their word distribution over topics, that is the words and 
their corresponding probability within the topic. Clustering and over-
lapping nodes indicate similar word distributions, and the surface of 
the node indicates the relative topic prevalence in the complete set of 
documents. The topic prevalence indicates how widespread a topic is 
within all the documents, as all topic proportions add up to 100%. In 
a fourth step, the analyst used this visualization in order to validate 
the choice of the final label for each topic (e.g. topics using similar 
vocabulary usually refer to similar subjects; thus, for example, the 
topics labelled by the analyst “domestic animals” and “astrophysics” 
appearing close together in the two- dimensional topic representation 
would raise suspicions and the analyst would have to go through the 
labelling procedure again in order to find labels that make sense for 
the two vocabulary- close topics). The labels were further validated in 
a fifth step, as described in the section Validation of Results.
2.7 | Calculating topical trends over time
To gain insight into the topical temporal dynamics of the fisheries field, 
we aggregated the document topic proportions for each year and for 
every individual topic into a composite topic- year proportion (see supple-
mentary material). Doing so provides a sense of how the prevalence of 
each topic within fisheries science publications has changed over the last 
26 years. Additionally, to obtain insight into increasing and decreasing top-
ical trends, we fit a one- dimensional least square polynomial for different 
time intervals. The polynomial coefficient is used as a proxy for the trend 
and defines the slope of the composite topic- year proportions for a range 
of years. Coefficients are multiplied by the number of years within each 
time interval to obtain the change measured in percentage points. Positive 
values indicate increasing or hot topics and negative values decreasing or 
cold topics. The time intervals allow for historical comparisons between 
1990–95, 1995–2000, 2000–05, 2005–10 and 2010–16. Colour coding 
is used to resemble the hot (i.e. red) and cold (i.e. blue) topical trends.
2.8 | Calculating topic over journals
Following a similar approach as topical trends over time, we aggre-
gate topic proportion per journal to gain insight into how topics are 
covered by the journals included in this study. Doing so enables us 
to identify broadly oriented or more focused oriented journals. Note 
that aggregation of topic proportions is handled per journal and cov-
ers only the years for which articles are downloaded (see Table 1). 
For example, for the journal Fish and Fisheries, journal topic distribu-
tions cover the time range 2000–16, whereas the journal ICES Journal 
of Marine Science covers the complete time range of 1990–2016.
2.9 | Relaxing LDA assumptions and future 
research directions
At the time of writing, the original LDA method proposed by Blei 
et al. (2003) had over 20,000 citations. The technique has received 
much 
attention 
from 
machine- learning 
researchers 
and 
other 
scholars and has been adopted and extended in a variety of ways. 
More concretely, relaxing the assumptions behind LDA can result 
in richer representations of the underlying semantic structures. 
The bag- of- words assumption has been relaxed by conditioning 
words on the previous words (i.e. Markovian structure) (Wallach, 
2006); the document exchangeability assumption, relaxed by the 
previously mentioned dynamic topic model (Blei & Lafferty, 2006), 
and the Bayesian nonparametric model can be utilized to auto-
matically uncover the number of topics (Whye Teh, Jordan, Beal, & 
Blei, 2004). Furthermore, LDA has been extended in various ways. 
Topics might correlate as a topic about “cars” is more likely to also 
be about “emission” than it is about “diseases.” The Dirichlet distri-
bution is implicitly independent, and a more flexible distribution, 
such as the logistic normal, is a more appropriate distribution to 
capture covariance between topics. The correlated topic model 
aids in this task (Blei & Lafferty, 2007). Other examples extending 
LDA include the author- topic model (Rosen- Zvi, Griffiths, Steyvers, 
& Smyth, 2004), the relational topic model (Chang & Blei, 2010), the 
spherical topic model (Reisinger, Waters, Silverthorn, & Mooney, 
2010), the sparse topic model (Wang & Blei, 2009) and the bursty 
topic model (Doyle & Elkan, 2009). Apart from its applicability to 
text, LDA can be applied to audio (Kim, Narayanan, & Sundaram, 
2009), video (Mehran, Oyama, & Shah, 2009) and image (Fergus, 
Fei- Fei, Perona, & Zisserman, 2005) data. Those topic models that 
relax or extend the original LDA model bring additional computa-
tional complexity and their own sets of limitations and challenges; 
nevertheless, it would be interesting to explore these models in 
future research.
3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

ics (k = 25). The ten most probable words (i.e. the words with the 
highest probabilities), together with the semantically attached label 
for each uncovered latent topic, are shown in Table 2. The manually 
assigned labels for the 25 topics are as follows: (1) Conservation,

proportions within the complete corpus, and their grouping in over-
arching themes can be found in Figure 2.
Conditioning the topics on the word “fishery”/“fisheries” (i.e. tak-
ing into consideration the probability assigned to this word), these 
25 topics can be divided into four groups, the first two of which 
we considered to be directly relating to fisheries: using the word 
often (n = 3), moderately (n = 5), infrequently (n = 8) or almost not 
at all (n = 9) (Figure 3). The topics using this word often are, in de-
scending order: (25) Fisheries management, (19) Fishing gear, and

(16) Stock assessment. Almost one- fifth of all the topics are using 
the 
word 
“fishery”/“fisheries” 
moderately: 
(1) 
Conservation, 
(3) 
Salmon, (4) Reproduction, (8) Freshwater, (24) Estuaries. One- third 
of all the topics are using the word “fishery”/”fisheries” infrequently: 
(2) Morphology, (7) Biochemistry, (10) North Atlantic, (13) Genetics, 
(15) Growth experiments, (17) Growth, (18) Tracking and moving, 
(22) Salmonids. Another one- third of all of the topics does not use 
this word almost at all: (5) Non- fish species, (6) Corals, (9) Diet, (11) 
Southern Hemisphere, (12) Development, (14) Assemblages, (20) 
Primary production, (21) Models, (23) Acoustics and swimming.
Considering all the 25 topics, only one [i.e. (25) Fisheries man-
agement] refers explicitly to the human dimension component of 
the fishery system, something that confirms our working hypoth-
esis that the human dimension of fisheries is under- represented in 
the fisheries specialty literature. To evaluate whether the human 
dimension of fisheries as SECASs is further refined within the 
Fisheries management topic, following the same methodology as 
described above, we created a new LDA model that zooms in on 
this topic, thereby creating subtopics from the broader Fisheries 
management topic. The new model uncovered 12 subtopics from 
the topic Fisheries management (Table 3), out of which eight as-
sign higher probability to the term “fishery”/”fisheries” (i.e. use this 
word often or moderately) and, thus, were considered directly re-
lating to fisheries: three on various management approaches (i.e. 
Co- management, 
Precautionary 
approach 
and 
Quota 
systems); 
three on economics (i.e. Markets, Bioeconomics and Blue econ-
omy); and two on type of fishery (i.e. Small- scale fisheries and 
Recreational fisheries).
Out of the total of 25 topics uncovered by our analysis, three 
were considered generic [i.e. (10) North Atlantic, (11) Southern 
Hemisphere, (21) Models)]. Out of the remaining 22 topics, 20 cover 
the natural dimension of fisheries, reasonably mirroring the cur-
riculum of fisheries biology and fisheries ecology higher education 
courses (e.g. Jennings, Kaiser, & Reynolds, 2009; King, 2007), but 
not addressing topics such as climate change. However, considering 
the focus of the two remaining topics, that is (1) Conservation and 
(25) Fisheries management, it is apparent that the research focus in 
fisheries during the last 26 years has not entirely captured the com-
plexity of the fisheries domain, especially of the human dimension 
component, something also observed for specialized research areas 
such as, for example, by- catch reduction technology (Campbell & 
Cornwell, 2008; Molina & Cooke, 2012). These results seem to be 
confirmed by the bibliometric analyses published in Aksnes and 
Browman (2016) and Jarić et al. (2012), where no human dimension- 
related words were identified among the most frequent words used 
in fisheries publication titles and abstracts. This situation might not

for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which is one of the most im-
portant fisheries- related intergovernmental organization, despite 
having along the years various groups working more or less directly 
working with different aspects of this human dimension, now only 
one out of more than 45 expert groups is working explicitly with this 
dimension of fisheries. This group, the Strategic Initiative Human 
Dimension, became operational in 2015.
Persisting in having this heavily unbalanced focus between the 
two dimensions of fisheries systems (i.e. the human dimension [i.e. 
human agents, communities of these and their institutions] and the 
natural dimension [i.e. biotic, such as predator species and prey spe-
cies, and abiotic, such as water temperature and nutrients]) will not 
help in understanding the behaviour of fisheries stakeholders (from 
fishers to consumers), leading to unintended, and too often unde-
sirable, management outcomes (Fulton, Smith, Smith, & van Putten, 
2011), and thus unsustainable fisheries. Responding to the chal-
lenges posed by sustainable fisheries necessitates the development 
of stronger networks within the family of human dimension sciences 
and across disciplinary boundaries with the natural dimension sci-
ences (Symes & Hoefnagel, 2010). Without providing an exhaustive 
list and in random order, the human dimension in fisheries could be 
included in fisheries science by addressing topics such as institutional 
aspects (enforcement and compliance, policy interactions, etc.), so-
cial aspects (gender, religion/beliefs, welfare, social cohesion, social 
networks, education and learning, human agency, health, safety and 
security at sea, food security, perception, attitudes, social norms, 
compliance, mental models of various actors involved in fisheries, 
etc.), economic aspects (poverty, innovation, distribution of bene-
fits, spiritual, inspirational and aesthetic services of fisheries, etc.), 
political aspects (power structures, transparency, etc.) and cultural 
aspects (traditional/local ecological knowledge, history, cultural di-
mensions, culinary choices, heritage, blue humanities, fisheries lit-
eracy, etc.) (Charles, 2001; De Young, Charles, & Hjort, 2008; ICES, 
2016; Österblom et al., 2013; Sowman, 2011; Spalding, Biedenweg, 
Hettinger, & Nelson, 2017; Stone- Jovicich, 2015).
Continuing our analysis, three topic clusters can be identified in 
Figure 2, indicating a similar probability distribution over words (i.e. 
topics that are, to some extent, related to the words they use to de-
scribe the theme): a growth cluster [the topics Growth experiments 
(15), Diet (9), Non- fish species (5), Primary production; Development 
(12), 
Reproduction 
(4) 
and 
Growth 
(17)]; 
an 
institutions 
cluster 
[the topics Fisheries management (25) and Conservation (1)]; and 
a salmonids cluster [the topics Freshwater (8), Tracking and move-
ment (18), and Salmonids (22); one would expect to find here also 
the topic Salmon (3), but, interestingly from a linguistics point of 
view, this topic seems rather isolated]. The most isolated topics are 
Morphology (2) and Biochemistry (7), indicating most probably the 
use of a very specific topic distribution over words.
The most frequent aquatic organisms mentioned in our corpus 
are salmonids (e.g. salmon, trout) and other freshwater organisms 
(e.g. perch); shark (within the topic Reproduction); crab, mussel, and 
oyster (within the topic Non- fish species); cod, lamprey, and her-
ring (within the topic North Atlantic); whale (within topic Southern 
Hemisphere); sturgeon (within the topic Growth); tuna (within the 
topic Fishing gear); and shrimp (within topic Estuaries). Commercially 
important species, such as anchoveta, pollock, and tilapia, were not 
included among the most frequent words of any of the 25 topics. 
These findings are relatively consistent with Aksnes and Browman 
(2016) and Jarić et al. (2012), who reported that the most frequently 
studied group of species was the Salmonidae, followed by the Atlantic 
cod, and that there is no correlation between the production of vari-
ous species and the number of publications about these species.
Aquaculture has not been identified as a topic of its own in our 
dataset, and the word aquaculture was not included in the top 10 most 
frequent words of any of the 25 topics. However, the word aquaculture 
was included in the top 10 most frequent words for the subtopic Blue 
economy under the topic Fisheries management, possibly indicating 
the interest in this relatively new industry in a context that focuses 
on increasing economic activities in the marine and maritime sector.
With regard to the typology of fishers by Charles (2001), only the 
recreational type is specifically mentioned among the most frequent 
words in our corpus, with the word angler included in the topic (8) 
Freshwater. This might be because the research focusing on the other 
types (e.g. subsistence, artisanal) does not employ a very specific 
vocabulary, or that there might be a lag in research on, for example, 
small- scale and artisanal fishery (Purcell & Pomeroy, 2015). However, 
if we look only at topic (25) Fisheries management, the recreational 
type and small- scale type have each its subtopic, indicating that, from 
a management perspective, these two types of fisheries have been 
relatively extensively explored by fisheries scientists.
Out of the 25 topics uncovered by our LDA model, two refer 
to large geographical areas: the North Atlantic (10) and Southern 
Hemisphere (11). The words Norwegian (within the topic North 
Atlantic) and Florida [within the topic Estuaries (25)] are the only 
specific geographical references among the top 10 most probable 
words. These very few specific geographical references might indi-
cate that most of the fisheries research is focused on a few areas 
around the globe, leaving large zones underexplored, as also indi-
cated in Molina and Cooke (2012), or that research about other re-
gions is published in other languages than English.
3.2 | Topic proportions within documents
For every document, the LDA model infers the topical decomposi-
tion, indicating which topics are found in that document and in what 
proportions. The assumptions behind LDA cause documents to ex-
hibit mainly a small number of main topics, with other topics very 
close to zero (note that all topics per document sum up to 1). This 
structure assumes that documents are often about some topics, 
rather than being about all topics equally. Following this line of rea-
soning, we analysed the remaining topic proportions for documents 
exhibiting one of the topics as the dominant topic, this being defined 
as the document’s topic proportion that exceeds all other topic pro-
portions. Such an analysis provides insight into the document com-
position that comes from the mixing topic proportions, that is what 
topics co- occur together within fisheries research articles.

SYED 
Et

.
Figure 4 shows the average remaining topic proportions with re-
spect to the dominant topic displayed as a heat map. The dominant 
topic, shown on the left (i.e. rows), has the average dominant topic 
proportion within parentheses. A higher number indicates that more 
of the document content deals with the dominant topic, while the 
other topics make up the smaller remaining portion of the document. 
Conversely, lower numbers reflect a dominant topic making up a 
smaller portion of the document, leaving more room for other topics 
to be part of that document. For example, documents dealing with the 
topic Fishing gear are on average allocating 45% of their content to 
their own topic, leaving 55% of the remaining content to other top-
ics (for example, 9% to the topic Models and between 4% and 6% to 
each of the topics Fisheries management, Acoustics and swimming, 
Stock assessment, and Southern Hemisphere). Furthermore, the re-
maining average topic proportions, shown at the top (i.e. columns), are 
sorted from high to low and reflect which topics more frequently, or 
to a higher extent, co- occur with other topics. For example, given any 
document with a dominant topic, the remaining topic proportion deals 
more often with the topics Models, Stock assessment, Fish reproduc-
tion or Growth experiments (i.e. these three topics have the highest 
co- occurrence), and less often with the topics Salmonids, Genetics or 
Salmon (i.e. these three topics have the lowest co- occurrence).
Documents dealing with the most prevalent topic in the corpus 
directly relating to fisheries, that is Fisheries management, allocate to

this topic almost 60% of their content, about 13% to Conservation, and 
between 3% and 5% to topics such as (in descending order): Fishing 
gear, Models and Stock assessment. Documents dealing with the most 
prevalent topic in the rest of the corpus, that is Primary production, 
allocate to this topic 55% of their content, and between 3% and 6% to 
topics such as (in descending order): Non- fish species, Biochemistry, 
Models, Diet, Southern Hemisphere, and Growth experiments.
Co- occurrence 
of 
such 
topics 
might 
be 
something 
natural. 
However, it would be interesting to consider whether other mixtures 
of topics would bring novel, and possibly also innovative, insight into 
fisheries science. Such an insight is highly needed in order to achieve 
sustainable 
fisheries 
exploitation 
and 
implement 
the 
fisheries- 
related actions of the international ocean governance objectives 
(European Commission, 2016).
3.3 | Topical trends over time and topic prevalence
To gain insight into the temporal changes of topics, we display the top-
ical trend values and topic prevalence in Figure 5. The left- hand side 
displays the fitted increase (hot topics) or decrease (cold topics) in per-
centage points for different time intervals and represents the change 
in composite topic- year proportions within a certain time frame. 
Additionally, we display the average composite topic- year proportions 
for every topic on the right- hand side, referred to as topic prevalence. 
Individual trend lines for the 25 broad fisheries topics, as well as the 
topical trends and prevalence for the Fisheries management subtopics, 
can be found in the supplementary material—Figures S1–S3.
With regard to the groups of topics described in Table 2, during 
the entire period of 26 years, taken together, the 11 topics referring 
to aquatic organisms biology themes made up 40% of the corpus; 
the groups of topics on the themes of specific species, modelling, 
management and habitats, between 11% and 14% each; the two 
topics on the theme of geographical regions, 7% together; and the 
fishing gear topic, almost 5%. The topics Models, Primary produc-
tion and Fisheries management are the most prevalent in the corpus 
during the entire period of 26 years, with approximately 7%, 6.5% 
and 6%, respectively, from the total number of documents. The top-
ics Salmon, Salmonids and Morphology are the least prevalent, with 
only around 2% of the corpus accounting for each. The topic Models 
has been among the top three most prevalent topics since 1995. 
Primary production was the most prevalent topic in the first three 
time periods we analysed (from 1990 to 2005). Topics directly re-
lating to fisheries, such as Fisheries management and Stock assess-
ment, were among the top 3 of most prevalent topics in the period 
2005–10 (both topics), and 2010–16 (only Fisheries management). 
The topic Conservation joined this top during the last 6 years.
Taken together, topics that could be grouped as relating to fresh-
water fisheries (i.e. Freshwater, Tracking and movement, Salmonids, 
Salmon, Estuaries, Assemblages) account for one- sixth of the cor-
pus. These results, corroborated with the declining interest in these 
topics in the last 16 years (see Figure 5), confirm the findings of Jarić 
et al. (2012) that indicate a general decline in the frequency of stud-
ies focused on freshwater habitats.
The top four hottest topics of the last 26 years (overall column) are 
(in descending order): Fisheries management, Conservation, Models 
and Fishing gear (with Stock assessment, the third topic directly re-
lating to fisheries, in 7th place). The interest in models has also been 
confirmed by Jarić et al. (2012), and this, in addition to the prevalence 
of the modelling topics, which was described above, provides empir-
ical evidence for the fact that modelling is one of the most important 
research methods in fisheries science (Angelini & Moloney, 2007). 
The topic Fisheries management, the third most prevalent topic in the 
corpus, remained among the top three hottest topics during the last 
11 years, while it was the coldest topic in the first half on the 1990s.
The configuration of top three hottest and top three coldest top-
ics has fluctuated during the five time periods we have analysed. 
However, the topic Primary production has constantly been ranked 
among the coldest topics (with the topic Biochemistry also being in 
this top in the period 1990–2005). Overall the 26- year period, it is 
interesting to note that Primary production was the most prevalent 
topic, but at the same time had the steepest decline in interest. The 
topics Models and Conservation have been a constant occurrence in 
the top three hottest topics since the turn of the Century, whereas 
the topic Fisheries management only joined this top category in 
2005. Another topic directly relating to fisheries, Fishing gear, was 
part of this top in the period 2000–05.
The increased prevalence in the corpus of the topic Fisheries 
gear and the constant interest shown in this topic, together with the 
constant prevalence in the corpus of the topic Stock assessment and 
the constant interest shown in this topic, indicate that fishing gear 
and stock assessment have been the central elements of fisheries 
science in the last 26 years. The increasing prevalence and interest 
in the topic Fisheries management might indicate the strengthening 
of the connection between fisheries science and management pro-
cesses, in the light of the growing concern about the status of fish 
stocks worldwide. Stock assessments provide a scientific and quan-
titative basis to the process of developing and implementing a man-
agement plan (Hoggarth, Mees, & O’Neill, 2005) and, as such, are 
indispensable to management processes (Hoggarth et al., 2006). The 
interest in the topics Growth and Reproduction seems to be most 
stable among all the 25 topics when looking at the entire period of 
26 years, even though the prevalence of these topics is rather small 
(around 3%). The constant interest in the latter can be explained by 
the importance of fisheries reproduction for fisheries assessment 
and management (Jakobsen, Fogarty, Megrey, & Moksness, 2016).
3.4 | Topical trends over journals
Although many journals included in our analysis overlap to some 
extent in their content, it is possible to identify journals that seem 
specialized in specific topics (Figure 6). For example, almost one- 
fifth of the publications that appeared in the journal Fish and 
Fisheries relate to the topic Fisheries management, whereas another 
approximatively one- fifth is related to the topic Conservation. 
Among the topics directly relating to fisheries, the journals Marine 
Policy and Marine Resource Economics are highly specialized in the

topic of Fisheries management, and the journals Fisheries research 
and CCAMLR Science, in the topic Fishing gear. It appears that no 
journal is highly specialized in Stock assessment, with this topic 
being addressed by almost all the journals. The top three journals 
publishing this topic are ICES Journal of Marine Science, Fisheries 
Oceanography, and Fish and Fisheries, with 10%–11% of the publica-
tion space of each of these journals covering this topic.
3.5 | Validation of results
We validated the output of the LDA model (including its labelling) by 
comparing the hot/cold LDA topics in the period 2000–09 with the hot/
cold words used in publication titles in the same period identified by 
the bibliometric study of Jarić et al. (2012). Some of the words that Jarić 
et al. (2012) identified as having the greatest increase in frequency can 
be directly linked to some of the hot topics identified by our analysis, for 
example by-catch, longline, seabird in the bibliometric study relate to the 
topic Fishing gear (19) identified by our study; genetic relates to the topic 
Genetics (13). Likewise, some of the words with the largest decrease in 
frequency can be directly linked to some of the cold topics identified by 
the LDA analysis over the same period, for example Atlantic in the biblio-
metric study relates to the topic North Atlantic identified by our study; 
growth, to the topics Growth (17) and Growth experiments (15); recruit-
ment, to the topic Stock assessment (14); feeding, to the topic Diet (9).
4 | CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS
From the analysis of more than 46,500 full- text articles published in 
21 top fisheries journals it is apparent that, during the last 26 years, 
the research focus of fisheries science has been predominately on 
the natural dimension of the fisheries system, with 22 out of 25 
topics referring to this dimension. While the natural dimension of 
fisheries was split into various aspects covering topics from specific 
species to fish catch technology, the human dimension was explic-
itly expressed only through one, albeit the hottest topic in the data 
set and the second most prevalent: Fisheries management. Although 
there is undoubtedly some scientific production addressing various 
aspects of the human dimension of fisheries, it could be that the nar-
rative used to describe the human dimension is not explicit enough 
to be captured by word co- occurrence, or that the human dimen-
sion is not prevalent enough to be recognized as a general topic or 
specific subtopic by the LDA model. Additionally, it might be that 
the scientific production on the human dimension is published in 
journals other than those specialized in fisheries or other types of 
outlets, such as books and book chapters. We could advance vari-
ous hypotheses as to why this might be the case [e.g. most fishery 
scientists are biological/natural sciences trained and oriented (Link, 
2010); those who are non- natural sciences trained and oriented tend 
to publish in outlets that foster recognition from within their own 
scientific communities, such as books, rather than journals], but this 
exercise would be outside the scope of this study. Instead, we want 
to emphasize two important recommendations: (i) diversification of 
the scientific focus so that it covers more of the complexity of fish-
eries, especially the human dimension (funding bodies play a crucial 
role here by setting the research agenda) and (ii) publication of fish-
eries research in outlets more likely to reach the intended audience 
(i.e. top interdisciplinary journals or specialized fisheries journals, 
if the objective of publishing is to contribute to fisheries sustain-
ability by reaching fisheries policy- and decision- makers). A lack of 
interdisciplinary synthesis in research is one of the major factors in 
fisheries collapses (Smith & Link, 2005). Thus, more integrative re-
search and research focused on the under- represented topics might
