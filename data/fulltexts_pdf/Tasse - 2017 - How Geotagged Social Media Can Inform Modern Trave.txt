BSTRACT
Modern tourists travel
in new ways.
The rising class of so-called “Creative
tourists” prefer to explore everyday life instead of simply ticking off a list of sights
to see.
However, travel guides all currently represent places as simply a collection
of sights.
At the same time,
public geotagged social media data is opening a new world
of ways to investigate another place.
In this thesis, I describe efforts to bring these
trends together,
by developing neighborhood guides for travelers,
based on social
media.
I first investigate why people geotag and where this public geotagged data
comes from.
Then, after developing a model of what tourists want through a series
of interviews and surveys, I develop a prototype social-media-based neighborhood
guide for travelers.
By an iterative user study and quantitative investigation into
photo sources, I find that this data can give users an ideal glimpse into a new city.
Implications are widespread:
I show not only how social media can be used to
help people travel,
but also develop a perspective on what social media tells,
and
does not
tell,
about
cities and neighborhoods.
I show that
social
media provides
an idealized qualitative image into a city, while perhaps not reflecting the objective,
quantitative reality.
This matches tourists’ needs ideally, providing an exciting new
opportunity for a new generation of tourism tools.

NTRODUCTION
Man,
thank you to so many people.
This has probably been the hardest thing I’ve ever done,
which I guess says something about growing up an upper-middle-class white man in the US, but
regardless, it was still hard, and I certainly wouldn’t have gotten through this on my own.

First, we’ve got to do the easy ones.
Thank you to Tati for being incredibly supportive and just
the absolute best,
even though this whole PhD process must
have constantly brought
out
the
worst in me.
And thank you to CMU for unwittingly bringing us together.
If I had spent these 5
years doing nothing else but meeting you, Tati, it would be 100% worth it.
My family too, of course.
Thanks, Mom, Dad, and Cheryl, for always being there for me, PhD
world and beyond. For funding my way through CMU the first time so I could come back on my
own dime. And to my family that has become my family over these last 5 years: Jon, and Dana,
Lukas, Natasha, and Ivana.

I guess next most important in getting me to graduate are the people who logistically made it
happen:
all
the professors who took a chance on me.
Chronologically,
I’ve got
to start
with
Noah Smith, who made time to meet with me, a confused undergrad who didn’t know what the
academic world meant, stuck with me when my undergrad project ended up kind of a mess, and
still was happy to help me get back into the academic world.
Shwetak Patel, who allowed me to
just start showing up in his lab in 2011 and working on stuff, and Julie Kientz, who let me run
an entire project that ended up trying to bite off way more than I could chew, but still wrote me
a nice letter to convince these folks at CMU to accept me.
Thank you to Anind Dey,
for being willing to take me on even though our academic interest
overlap was really just “ubiquitous computing is cool,” and letting me realize myself that that’s
not really a research direction.
Joshua Hailpern and Anupriya Ankolekar for taking me on as
an intern,
despite that our project fizzled out thoroughly by internship day 5,
and then Ayman
Shamma and Bart Thomee for taking yet another chance on me at really a pretty critical time.
Thank you to Ayman in particular; I don’t know if I’d have finished this whole thing without your
support.
(Special shout-out to the HCI Research team, and then the Vision team, for being my
home away from home while I was finishing up.
I really appreciate how much you welcomed
me in. Thesisizing is lonely and having some friends really helps.)
Thank you to my committee, Niki and Jodi and Judd.
I know, it’s maybe not the most intensive
iv
working relationship you’ve had, but I appreciate knowing that you’re in my corner.
And thank you to Jason. Thanks for advising me when I was super lost here, thanks for continu-
ing to believe in me when I cooked up not only a bad pancake but a whole bad breakfast, thanks
for spending probably all your unrestricted grants to fund me, thanks for just really being kind
and easy to work with.
I hate to squash this paragraph in the middle here; I feel like it should
be dramatically at the beginning or the end of a section.
I will say,
if there’s one person who
explained most of the variance of me finishing this thing, it’s got to be Jason, so thanks for that.
Coworkers and coauthors!
Thanks to Alex, Zichen, JZ, Will, Jason W, Beka, Jenny, and Dave;
in some cases you gave me a little boost, in some cases you carried me on your back.
In either
case,
I appreciate it.
And thanks to Himanshu,
Erick,
Andy,
Jennifer,
Hong Bin,
Emily,
Josh,
Jinny, Eva, and Sriram for putting up with me as I learn how to manage or mentor people. I hope
I didn’t steer you too far astray.
Before we leave this section,
I want to also thank Lauren,
Ja’Ron,
Justin,
and Jessica for per-
sonally helping me get things done here.
(or sometimes, doing the things themselves.)
And of
course, Queenie. Wouldn’t have been able to do it without you either.

RIENDSHIPS
Thank you to my wonderful cohort:
Chris, Caitlin, Nikola, Annie, Dave, Vivian, Jenny, Ryan,
Brandon, JoAnna, Anthony, and Shuang.
I didn’t know at first why they made such a big deal
at the HCII about this, but realized that it’s really hard to get through it if you don’t have others
you can commiserate with.
Thank you to my amazing puzzling squad: Kelly, Erik, Robert, and
Julia.
Tati and the rest of the obscure restaurants clique:
Jeff, Beka, Sauvik, and Anna.
Album
Club, which I think is a subset of these people. And, I mean, a blanket thank you to all the CMU
friends I haven’t mentioned here; there isn’t a single HCII student that I don’t wish I could have
spent more time with.
I picked CMU for grad school primarily because I got along so well with the students.
That
turned out to be absolutely correct.
Thanks also to my outside-CMU friends, who reminded me that there is another world out there;
that
was really important,
especially in the most
difficult
times.
Thank you to Beej,
Nicole,
Aaron, Mel, Greg, Ruth, Nils, Anne, and all my kickball teammates along the way.
And thank
you to amazing housemates and friends Emmy and Sethie, and honorary housemate Farmer Jim.

MPORTANT
Not to get too heavy before even the Table of Contents, but the depressed grad student is a trope
for a reason. Grad school is hard. It might wear on your mental health. If it is, you should really
get that help.
Thank you to Michael at CAPS for starting the ball rolling on me getting help at all.
Thank
you to the first
other therapist
I started seeing,
and my psychiatrist
out
here,
whose names I
forget;
thank you to Joshua out
here in SF for keeping me sane through the remote-working
v
home stretch. And thank you to Ryan; I wish you could have had someone who’d helped you as
much as you’d helped me.

Note that most people geotag far from their home:
only 11.9% tag in their home neighborhood, and less than half are in their home
city.
Most people also geotag in places that they visit rarely: 70% of these geo-
tags happen in places that people go annually or less frequently.

NTRODUCTION
People travel differently than they used to.
They want to “understand the feel of an area”,
to
“see everyday life”, to “live like a local” instead of just “seeing the tourist sights.” Part of this
is due to the excesses of the tourism industry,
part of it is due to the ever-decreasing cost of
leisure travel, and part of it is due to increasing curiosity about how our fellow humans live. The
shift is large enough that some have called it a demographic shift, describing modern travelers
as “creative tourists” [76], “new urban tourists” [23], or “Explorers” [93].
Airbnb, for example,
suggests Explorers may be 43% of their user base, numbering in the tens of millions [93]. But in
an unfamiliar place, these creative tourists may wonder where to go. After all, some parts of any
city may be boring, dangerous, or otherwise unsuitable.
Travelers need to be able to understand
the neighborhoods of a city to plan out an enjoyable trip.
This is a specific case of a general problem:
we need new ways to understand cities and neigh-
borhoods.
As more people move to cities throughout the 21st century,
quickly understanding
how places feel will become more and more important.
People moving will need to know what
neighborhood they would feel at home in, business owners will need to know where to expand
and market, and city planners will need to know how to allocate services and zone districts.
Travelers have a unique set of information needs, though, because they are new to a place and do
not have time to build up local knowledge from experience.
Unlike the sun-and-sand tourists of
two generations ago or the cultural-site-visiting tourists of last generation [19], today’s tourists
want to curate and create their own experience [76].
And more than ever, platforms like Airbnb
and Couchsurfing help them do so by staying in local neighborhoods instead of central tourist
districts.
Tools that are available to address these information needs all fall short.
Traditional guidebooks
from Fodor’s, Frommer’s, and Lonely Planet give people information about those central tourist
districts and sights to see.
Yelp and Foursquare give people information about the businesses,
the bars and restaurants and shops,
in an area,
but
travelers can’t
understand how the whole
neighborhood feels just from those venue-specific details.
Cities gather statistics - and indeed,
are releasing open data more than ever before - but numbers also fail to convey a neighborhood’s
culture. Finally, occasionally travelers can learn local vernacular descriptions, but these are often
shallow.
For example,
“Lawrenceville is the cool
neighborhood” or “South Side is the party
neighborhood.”
At the same time, people take pictures differently than they used to.
Most adults in the US have
smartphones [5] and therefore instant access to a camera.
Applications like Facebook,
Flickr,
and Instagram have turned photo sharing from a niche practice into a common one.
Beyond
photos, people have been sharing more on Twitter, Foursquare, and other social networks than
ever before.
Furthermore, people’s smartphones usually have GPS, enabling users to quickly tie
1
their photos to real-world locations.
As a result,
there is a large quantity of public geotagged
photos, as well as tweets, reviews, and other kinds of posts. One estimate has at least 500 million
tweets sent per day [46],
and a recent dataset release from Yahoo included 100 million public
photos, of which about half are geotagged [89].
In this thesis, I argue that these photos and other posts, all tied to locations, could help travelers
understand the cities they are traveling to.
After all,
pictures are rich sources of media that
can give people lots of information:
the proverbial “thousand words.” Social media posts have
other advantages over traditional travel guides as well.
They are scalable,
so it is feasible to
build guides cheaply to cover any neighborhood in almost any city, and they are democratic: the
resulting view of the neighborhood is controlled not by a publisher or elite critic, but by everyone
adding their own experiences.
If it is the case that social media can be valuable for travelers, it sheds light on an even bigger
question: what do geotagged social media posts tell us about the cities where they are produced?
A wide swath of research has tried to infer everything from how socio-economically deprived an
area is [71] to how attractive and magnetic it is [67], all from public social media.
In this document, I detail a research through design exploration into three questions:
•
What do creative tourists mean by “getting a feel for the city”?
•
How can social media help them achieve this goal?
•
What can social media tell us about our cities and neighborhoods?
To do so, I first studied why people post geotagged social media data by analyzing public geo-
tagged data and surveying 78 frequent geotagged tweeters and 400 geotaggers across six social
media services.
I then built a model of tourist information search based on interviews with 14
travelers and 490 survey responses. Based on this model, I designed a Neighborhood Guides web
app and evaluated it with 10 participants to try to address their needs.
I then tested six differ-
ent sources of photos in a Mechanical Turk study to determine which photo set best represented
their neighborhoods.
Finally, with an improved set of photos, I conducted a user study with 21
participants on an improved version of the Neighborhood Guides web site, trying out different
variants to best understand what they were seeing in these guides and how it could help them.
The contributions of this thesis are therefore not the construction of the Neighborhood Guides
website, but the insights that its iterative design process has provided to these research questions
above. I found that creative tourists want safety, convenience, liveliness, aesthetic appeal, and the
ability to live like a local.
Social media, particularly a diverse and well-organized set of photos
selected using their annotations and contents,
can help creative tourists find these dimensions
they want.
In this way, social media can offer one lens into the city: it shows the idealized city,
not the “realistic” one, but this is what these tourists want.
These findings can help companies, or indeed local governments, design travel guides for future
travelers. This will make it easier and more fun to travel to big cities, but also more fun to travel
to mid-sized or small cities that currently do not get as much tourist attention. With international
travel destinations like Paris and Venice losing character due to a deluge of tourists and smaller
2
but worthwhile cities like Cleveland and Atlanta needing ways to attract investment, this could
benefit the entire tourism industry.
Furthermore, this guide could be useful for planners beyond
travelers, especially for neighborhoods that are growing or developing and want to be like other
more popular neighborhoods.
Point-based guides and statistics can only go so far to help us understand crucial aspects of a
city’s culture, and travelers nowadays want to know that culture more and more.
This tool will
help people deepen their understanding of cities, and help researchers learn about cities as well.
The rest of the chapters in this paper will be structured as follows:
2.
A review of related work regarding geotagged social media and tourism
3.
Three studies about
why people geotag:
One observational
study of Twitter and Flickr
users and two surveys (N=78 and N=400)
4.
Two formative studies (14 interviews and a survey of 490 people) leading to the develop-
ment of a model of creative tourist information search
5.
Design of the Neighborhood Guides prototype and an introductory (N=10) user study
6.
Mechanical Turk study of the most representative photo set for a neighborhood (N=200)
7.
Final user study with a revised Neighborhood Guides prototype (N=21)
8.
Discussion combining findings from all the studies, and directions for future work
9.
Conclusion
In summary, I show three research contributions: first, the model of creative tourists’ information
needs;
second,
examples of ways that social media can help tourists;
and third,
evidence that
geotagged social media shows an idealized view of cities.

OURISM
While urban tourism was not a focus of early tourism research, it has recently become a growing
field [23].
Travel in previous decades had meant traveling to beaches, beautiful natural sites, or
resort towns; but in recent years urban tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism mar-
ket, growing by 47% between 2009 and 2014 [11].
The character of urban tourism is changing
as well as the volume:
new urban tourists want to “experience and feel a part of everyday life”
[57].
Furthermore, they seek to have an active hand in co-creating the experiences, rather than
passively paying for and absorbing an experience [6].
Lists of sights to see and experiences to
buy no longer suffice.
2.1.1
A
UTHENTICITY
When modern tourists travel to a city, they are often looking for an authentic experience of that
city,
rather than a manufactured diversion.
The search for authenticity in tourism has a long
history dating back at
least
to the 1970s [56].
This early work suggested that
places had a
“front stage” and a “back stage”, like Goffman writes about in people [25].
There are different
types of “front
stage” and “back stage”;
a shop or a bank might
be the most
“front
stage”,
living with someone in their home might be very “back stage”,
and experiences like a tour of
orchestra practice spaces or a cooking class in someone’s home might
be at
an intermediate
level.
MacCannell
suggests that
all
travelers want
to get
closer to the back stage,
but
this is
clearly not strictly true;
after all,
many people travel explicitly to very “front stage” locations
like Disneyland.
Later writers have partially resolved this tension by talking not
about
how
“authentic” a place is, but by how authentic an experience in a place is [95].
I will discuss the
authenticity tension further in Chapter 4.
Regardless of the details of travelers’ exact definitions of “authenticity”,
recent developments
have aided their search in new ways,
particularly with regard to lodging.
Because hotels his-
torically clustered in a few areas of cities,
like downtown and near airports,
they cannot show
travelers all the sides of a city they may want to see, so travelers are turning to alternatives.
The
peer-to-peer lodging rental site Airbnb, for example, has become a popular, and more “authen-
tic”, way for travelers to rent rooms in residential parts of town [82, 96]. Similarly, Couchsurfing
allows users to stay with locals for free (often on their spare couch,
hence the name) [96].
As
4
urban tourists change from “mass tourists” to “cultural” and “creative” tourists [76],
“mass”
lodging no longer suffices either.
New urban tourists want to stay in interesting residential neighborhoods and spend time “wan-
dering about”,
“taking in the city”,
and “getting among the people” [6].
To do this,
they need
guides to areas,
not
specific venues.
Urban tourism,
unlike other forms of tourism like “sun
and sand” tourism, depends on the serendipity and spontaneity that results from getting to know
neighborhoods, and on the individual’s ability to co-create their experience.
Current tools help
people discover points, not overall pictures of parts of the cities.
2.1.2
A
NTI

OURIST
I
DENTITY
One interesting characteristic of modern tourists is to think of themselves as particularly unique
and unlike “other tourists.”
For example,
in one study of German tourists in Norway,
89.5%
of respondents thought
of themselves as “nontypical
tourists” [69].
Many have investigated
this kind of “anti-tourist attitude”; Jacobsen provides a thorough overview [36].
This attitude,
present since at least the 1960s, seems to be a reaction to the democratization of travel and the
homogeneity of mass tourism.
Travelers see themselves as largely outside the tourist role for a
number of reasons: to maintain social status when outside their normal lives, to explore a heroic
ideal
of exploration,
and to assert
identity in a group that
they cannot
quite afford.
There is
also a perception that tourism hurts a local area, as in Kreuzberg, Berlin, where travelers will go
out of their way to convince themselves that they are not contributing to the gentrification and
commercialization of the area [23].
Creative tourists are more likely than others to perform this anti-tourist identity.
Edensor de-
scribes off-the-beaten-path travelers like backpackers preferring like to distinguish themselves
from package tourists and from each other, adopting various non-conformist tourist performances
to do so [22]. As a result, to visit a place that is “touristic” would be not only frustrating but even
damaging to visitors’ performance of their chosen identity.
Creative tourists would reflexively
recoil from something that they thought would put them “on the beaten path”, so it is important
to focus any efforts to design for them with this important identity characteristic in mind.

ECOMMENDATIONS TO

OURISTS
Using social media to help tourists is not a new idea.
Since the early 21st century, researchers
have tried to use the abundance of social media data to recommend things for tourists to do. Work
in this vein includes recommendations of restaurants [34],
shops [84],
travel
routes [49,
65],
attractions and points of interest [24], and destinations [29]. These all use social media and user-
generated content such as user locations, so continuing in this vein seems like a logical choice.
In addition, sites like Yelp and Foursquare have dozens of user reviews, so aggregating reviews
and recommending the most highly-rated spots seems like a natural solution.
However, this approach has three shortcomings. First, people need to know why they are recom-
mended each place.
It would be rare for tourists to set out on a trip solely because an algorithm
recommended it.
Second, they solve problems that are already solved by Yelp and Foursquare:
finding a restaurant or a point of interest by consulting one of these guides is easy. Finally, these
works neglect the changes in urban tourism discussed recently.
A recommendation algorithm
5
will likely push more people to the top destinations,
which then become overcrowded and no
longer as enjoyable.
Instead, we need guides to let people explore places on their own time and
create their own connections to them.
For these reasons, I decided not to continue in the vein of
providing discrete recommendations like these researchers have done.

Because of the shortcomings in the straightforward recommendation approach to computational
tourism, and the need to build browsable guides instead of pinpoint recommendations, it is valu-
able to take a wider view. Plenty of researchers have attempted to deepen our knowledge of cities
with social media in a number of ways. The rest of this section will survey those approaches.

One useful application is in finding the boundaries of regions. Most large US cities have official
neighborhood boundaries, but these have several problems.
They may be out of date, there may
be multiple conflicting definitions
1
, and they often fail to reflect the reality of human behavior.
These are often politically or financially motivated, like “NoPa” and “Lower Nob Hill,” which
San Francisco realtors use to convince affluent
clients that
they are not
in the less desirable
Western Addition or Tenderloin neighborhoods.
Instead of
settling for
these confusing and misleading neighborhood divisions,
recent
work
has been able to find reasonable neighborhood boundaries based on human behavior such as
Foursquare checkins [18,
97] or tweets [94].
This can reveal
aspects of neighborhood life
that is otherwise hidden, such as a neighborhood that contains two mostly-separate social sub-
neighborhoods.
This idea has also been extended beyond neighborhood bounds to delineating
less formal locally characterizing regions (like “red light district”) based on photos [88].
My work differs from these in terms of goals.
While I see the need for a better definition of
neighborhoods, I am not trying to do so myself, instead starting with neighborhoods as defined by
local government. I have chosen to do this because official neighborhoods instantly recognizable
(people are more likely to have associations with “Squirrel Hill” than with “Neighborhood 34”)
and in order to scope the project reasonably.
Also,
while there are border cases where people
have strong opinions about the exact definitions of their neighborhoods, these are likely rare and
will not affect results much.

Beyond finding the boundaries of regions, researchers have discovered ways to understand those
regions based on social media.
Because the quantity of social media is huge, these approaches
can be thought of as ways to summarize or model all of these posts.
Photo-sharing sites, particularly Flickr, have been well studied, due to the volume and richness
of their posts. Some of this research has been driven by practical concerns, like the need to show

photos on a map.
Toyama et al [91] developed techniques including thumbnails, point markers,
and isopleths to show how many photos existed on a map at a place before settling on a binning
approach they call “media dots.” However, these displays only show the number of photos, not
their contents,
so a series of other projects worked on summarizing photo content
as well
as
density.
Some of this research works on finding a subset
of photos that
is representative of a larger
set.
Jaffe et
al
[37] addressed the problem of summarizing photo content
by finding a sub-
set
of photos that
would accurately summarize a larger photo set.
They did this by cluster-
ing all of the photos and then ranking the clusters based on five criteria:
tag distinguishability,
photographer-distinguishability, density, image qualities, and arbitrary relevance factor (such as
a search query). Kennedy et al [43] further developed the ability to find the “most representative”
image from a set of photos using computer vision features such as SIFT. Crandall et al [15] did
the same: finding the top N “interesting” places in each city and a “canonical” photo from each.
Besides investigating photo contents, researchers have investigated ways to summarize the tex-
tual tags that users add to their photos.
Ahern et al [4] and Jaffe et al [37] describe the World
Explorer/Tag Maps project, which summarized a series of photo tags into “representative tags”
for a region.
Kennedy and Rattenbury expanded this to describe semantics of places and events
[43, 72], while Kafsi et al further expanded it to understand which tags are locally relevant, which
are city-level, and which are country-level [42].
Summarizing textual content, like tweets, is somewhat easier because there is less total informa-
tion, so one can use a simple method like a word cloud (at least as a supplementary tool) to get
a sense of a large corpus of words [59].
More intelligent methods have been used for tweets,
for tasks like event detection [48] and location modeling [44].
Importantly for neighborhoods,
though,
Hao et
al
approach high-level
neighborhood modeling in another interesting manner,
creating Location-Topic Models based on what users write in travelogues [29].
Finally, neighborhood comparison [51] offers a way for people to understand neighborhoods in
a new city based on neighborhoods that
they already know.
This can help people talk about
imprecise or unnamed characteristics of neighborhoods: they may not know what they like about
their home neighborhood, but they know that they want to find someplace like it.
This work is quite interesting and I hope to reuse and extend it.
I will do so by repurposing
their results;
where the researchers in [37] delivered an algorithm to pick a subset
of photos
as a final product, for me this is only one input into the application that I’m building.
Similarly,
neighborhood comparison was the end result in [51], while it is only one feature in the application
that I am building. In summary, my work will be more about human needs in tourism, rather than
about deep algorithmic details.

D
ESCRIBING CITY RESIDENTS
Another set of research focuses on describing people who live in a certain area instead of the
area itself. Some of this work involves general studies of mobility, routines, and urban dynamics
[7, 45, 61], indicating where people go when and how far they travel.
For example, Komninos
et al [45] used a network of listening stations around Patras, Greece in order to see Foursquare
7
checkins around the center of the city. They were then able to quantify business traffic throughout
the day, and report where the “hot” areas of town were, so that locals and tourists could visit or
avoid them. Naaman et al used a similar approach on Tweets to show the standard daily patterns
in cities, and then show whether certain keywords followed similar patterns, to reflect mood and
happiness.
Besides being useful in itself for business owners and transportation planners,
this
mobility research can in turn describe well-being of a region [50].
Some also skip the middle
step and directly predict
socio-economic well-being from sentiment
analysis of social
media
posts [70]. These studies can be useful, albeit noisy, indicators over large urban areas.
Some researchers instead focus on demographics of the users.
This work can be low-level, such
as showing the gender makeup of commuters [55], or higher-level, indicating “topics” of users
based on their interests [40]. While these are both valid approaches, I chose not to focus on them
because they do not serve the same goal of helping travelers.
Demographics and mobility are
both too vague for travelers to make use of in a meaningful way.
2.3.4
C
HALLENGES IN THESE APPROACHES
While these approaches all have valid uses and results, they contain some shortcomings.
Good-
speed cites three main issues [27]:
•
Content Poverty:
social media contains broad data from many users,
but it usually fails
to contain deep enough data to answer any one particular question.
For example, a transit
researcher would lose the richness of traditional travel surveys, instead only knowing “this
person was near this point at this time.”
•
Espoused Theory vs.
Theory-in-use: social media data either tells what people are saying
or what they are doing, but not both, which hampers our ability to understand their reasons
for their actions. Especially in a public forum, people may not be doing exactly what they
say they are doing.
Their locations may even be spoofed, as many platforms allow.
When
we are using public data, we must realize that the data is only what people want to present
of themselves.
•
Positivist Assumptions: studying social media often implicitly assumes that the sample of
society that is shown on these public posts is representative enough of the world to answer
the researchers’ questions.
For example, if a researcher wanted to show where people go
at night in order to prioritize late night bus routes, they would have to contend with the fact
that the data only reflects the subset of users who tweet.
In short, social media data is broad but not deep; we should not conflate the size of data available
(often in the terabytes) with the usefulness of that data.
As one example,
Hecht and Stephens
[32] show that this data is biased towards urban areas and underrepresents what happens in rural
places.
As a result, we cannot simply use existing work directly to show tourists exactly what
the city is like.
In summary, this chapter presents three types of work. First, tourism research shows that the way
people travel is changing and that new tools,
guides,
and techniques are necessary in order to
support them. Second, existing recommendation systems offer one avenue to help these tourists,
8
but this is unsatisfactory.
As a result,
we turn to the third area of research:
how social media
helps us understand cities now, and how these techniques may be applicable in the future.

Before analyzing social media posts, it is important to know about how these posts are created.
This is a necessary first step to analyzing public social media data, because it offers context about
what the data means.
For example, imagine an Instagram picture of a meal.
If it was created by
someone while they were posting a Yelp review,
it
would signify something about
the meal:
perhaps that it was worth reviewing.
If it was created by someone who automatically uploaded
all their photos, and they were currently trying to track what they ate, it would mean much less.
Therefore,
Alex Sciuto,
Zichen Liu,
and I set out to study why people post public geotagged
social media posts, in order to inform the rest of the thesis work.
In this chapter,
we conducted three studies.
First,
we investigated public geotagged tweets,
finding that geotagging is toggled more than we expected, that Twitter changed its interface in
ways that
affected our data,
and that
job-posting spam bots became a nuisance.
Second,
we
surveyed 78 of the most frequent tweeters in our data set to understand why people choose to
add their locations. Third, we conducted a larger survey of 400 people across multiple platforms
to see their motivations for their last geotagged post.
We found that people do usually geotag
consciously, at places far from home, and at places that they have not been to very often.
This research helped answer my second and third research questions:
“Can social media help
travelers find what they want?” and “What does social media tell us about our cities and neigh-
borhoods?” The work in this chapter was published as State of the Geotags:
Motivations and
Recent Changes at the AAAI International Conference of Web and Social Media (ICWSM) in
2017 [86].

B
ACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Past work has investigated people’s behaviors on location-based social networks (LBSNs) like
Foursquare,
Facebook Places,
Dodgeball,
and Gowalla,
to learn who shares their location and
why [28, 53, 85].
However, many non-location-based social media services–including Facebook, Instagram, Twit-
ter, Snapchat, and Flickr–also allow users to add their location to a photo, video, or text post. One
study estimated 600,000 geotagged posts per day from a 10% sample of Twitter [52].
Flickr,
meanwhile,
has released a publicly available dataset of 49 million geotagged photos [90].
A
wide field of research has sprung from this wealth of publicly available geotagged posts,
such
as understanding demographics and social
dynamics in cities [60],
finding home locations of
individuals [41], and inferring likely friends [16].
For LBSNs, there is often a clear reason as to why someone checks-in to a location or tags some-
thing.
However,
there is currently little understanding of what people geotag on these popular
social media sites not centered around location, and why. Understanding what is being geotagged
10
and why can have implications for research. For example, finding people’s home locations based
on their check-ins could be very easy if people geotag mostly at home, or very difficult if they
only geotag when traveling.
As another example, models about people’s mobility patterns and
social dynamics will be very different if they are based on commute data or weekend shopping
and errands data.
It is easy to assume that geotagging in social media is similar to that for LBSNs,
but without
explicit investigation it can be difficult to know for cetain. To address this problem, we conducted
a series of studies to understand whether people use geotagging in social media similarly to the
way they use location-based social networks. We analyzed 4 million public tweets and 49 million
geotagged Flickr photos, surveyed 78 frequent Twitter users, and followed up by surveying 400
geotaggers across six social media services.
We found that most earlier findings in Foursquare
ring true in other social
media:
people geotag consciously and intentionally,
they geotag in
uncommon places,
they primarily do so to communicate and show where they’ve been,
and
they geotag soon after being at the place.
However, our analyses uncovered several new findings. We found that most Twitter users geotag
consciously and turn geotagging on and off frequently, but many Twitter users were inadvertently
geotagging,
or geotagging more precisely than they thought.
We uncovered a UI change that
addressed this issue, while also causing people to add coordinates less frequently and add place
names more frequently. We also discovered that the coordinate geotags that remain tend to have
more hiring-related spam.
Our findings have several research implications, given how often researchers use geotagged data.
It is important that the research community not misunderstand what people are providing when
they publish geotagged social media posts,
and it is important that we minimize the impact of
spam and other quality problems. Knowing why people geotag also helps application developers
better customize their software.
To support
these research and development
implications,
this paper offers two contributions.
First, we show confirmation and elaboration of earlier findings, and generalization from Foursquare
to other social media.
Second,
we expose a number of changes that have occurred as location
sharing has matured.
3.2
D
EFINITIONS
In this chapter, I use the term “geotag” to mean “a location added to a social media post.” We use
“coordinate geotag” to mean “an exact latitude-longitude coordinate added to a post.” A related
concept is a “placetag”,
or a tag referring to a plain-text location.
For example,
a post at the
Eiffel Tower could contain the placetag “Eiffel Tower,” “Paris,” or even “France.” It could also
or instead include the coordinate geotag (48.858, 2.295).
We refer to “checking in”, as in Foursquare and other location-based social networks, as a sep-
arate but related act.
In Foursquare, one opens the app primarily to share one’s location.
When
geotagging a tweet, photo, or other post in social media like Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, and Face-
book, however, the content of the post is usually the primary motivation, while location sharing
is usually secondary.

To understand what and why people geotag, we chose to start by analyzing publicly visible data
from Twitter and Flickr,
primarily because they offer the largest public data sets of geotagged
posts.
We started by collecting geotagged tweets via Twitter’s public streaming API. We chose to start
in Pittsburgh because it has a wide variety of users and because of our team’s high familiarity with
the area.
We selected all coordinate-geotagged tweets within 0.2 degrees latitude and longitude
from the center of Pittsburgh,
forming a 34km x 44km rectangle with corners at (40.241667,
-80.2) and (40.641667, -79.8).
We omitted tweets that listed an area (like ”Pittsburgh”) but did
not contain a latitude-longitude point.
We began gathering data in January 2014,
and by May
2016 we had about 4 million tweets.
We also gathered data in 12 other cities, mostly around the
United States
1
, to verify any results we found on the Pittsburgh data set. These other cities’ data
covered a shorter time span (11-23 months) but still the same order of magnitude of tweets, from
about 1 million in Austin to 11 million in London, totaling 60 million tweets.
We also examined the YFCC100M dataset [90] to gather information about geotagging on the
photo-sharing site Flickr. This data set contains metadata for 100 million photos and videos that
are shared publicly with a Creative Commons license.
Of these 100 million photos and videos,
about 49 million are geotagged.

EOPLE OFTEN TOGGLE GEOTAGGING
In Twitter’s mobile app,
users can choose to geotag or not,
but the default is whatever was set
last. If a user geotags one post, the next one will be geotagged as well unless the user turns it off.
As a result, we had initially assumed that geotagging was a setting people would mostly leave on
or off; that they would decide to geotag or not to geotag and then apply that to all of their social
media. However, this was not the case.
We selected a random sample of 3406 users from our data set and collected all of their public
tweets, geotagged and non-geotagged. We sampled users because Twitter’s API has rate limits of
180 requests per 15 minutes, and because it only supports collecting up to 200 tweets per request.
As such, collecting all tweets from all 68088 users would have taken prohibitively long.
For each of those users, we sorted their tweets in chronological order, then counted a “toggle”
every time they had a geotagged tweet followed by a non-geotagged tweet, as this likely indicated
they had made a conscious choice to geotag or not geotag something. We only used tweets from
their most frequent tweet source (such as “Twitter for iPhone” or “Twitter Web Client”) to avoid
counting false “toggles” caused by them, for example, tweeting from their phone then tweeting
from their computer.
We found that most people in this sample toggled geotagging relatively
regularly,
and only a minority (40.1%) toggled less than 1% of the time,
as we would expect
if they were geotagging automatically.
Figure 3.1 shows the distribution of how many of each

taken from a random sample of 3406 users out of all 68088 users who had geotagged at least
once in Pittsburgh; Flickr photos are taken from the YFCC100M dataset.
The “Less than 1%”
group can be considered those who always or never geotag; it is a minority, as most people toggle
geotagging at least occasionally.
users’ tweets were preceded by a toggle,
while Figure 3.2 shows toggling patterns for three
example users.
We saw similar patterns in the YFCC100M dataset. Out of the 581099 Flickr users in the data set,
214598 (36.9%) had posted at least one geotagged photo.
For these users who have geotagged
at least once, we counted toggles the same way as for Twitter users; results are shown in Figure
3.1.
Seeing roughly the same pattern as in Twitter gives us confidence that geotagging on social
media platforms is a conscious choice, not automatic.
3.4.2
C
HANGES IN GEOTAGS OVER TIME
Although it was not a primary research question, an interesting finding emerged about the pattern
of geotags over time.
In the YFCC100M dataset (see Figure 3.4), the overall count of photos is
rising in frequency, though geotagged photos are tapering off.
However, [38] found the percent
of photos with geotags in Flickr is increasing.
One possible explanation is that the decline in
geotagged photos is an artifact of the process of creating the YFCC100M dataset (or people’s
willingness to license photos as Creative Commons).
In our Twitter data,
however,
we noticed a sharp dropoff in the number of geotagged tweets
available after about May 2015. This was consistent across all of our cities; Figure 3.3 shows the
dropoff in a few example cities.
This is due to a UI change Twitter made in April 2015, when announcing a new partnership with
13
Figure 3.2: All tweets from three representative users. Blue Xs represent geotagged tweets while
orange Os are non-geotagged. User 1 geotags while traveling, User 2 tags because of a Wordpress
plugin, and User 3 sees no reason not to geotag.

Figure 3.3:

The sharp dropoff
around May 2015 is due to a Twitter UI change: placetagging, not coordinate geotagging, is now
the default.

As we will discuss

confusion and accidental privacy leaks.

OW MANY DISTINCT PLACES DO PEOPLE GEOTAG AT
?
We calculated how widely people’s geotag distribution varied. After excluding all accounts with
fewer than 20 geotagged tweets, we rounded each geotag to the closest 0.001 degree latitude and
longitude (creating bins about the size of 1-2 city blocks), then counted how many places each
account had posted a geotagged tweet.
We found that most people had between 1 and 35 places
(median = 18, 3rd quartile = 35, 95th percentile 103.8; see figure 3.5), but of course this depends
on the number of tweets.
We also calculated the number of tweets per place, finding that people
usually tweet about 4 times in a place,
though this varies widely (1st quartile = 2.3,
median =
3.9, 3rd quartile = 7.0, 99th percentile = 102.6).

0.001 degree latitude and longitude).
“Many-place accounts” post in multiple locations.
Not all
job posting bots post in one place, but a large percentage of one-place accounts are job bots.
One surprise we found is that some accounts geotag repeatedly in the same place.
We inspected
a random sample of 50 of the one-place accounts in the Pittsburgh area and found that about 15
accounts were bots that only posted job listings, 7 accounts had been deleted or protected, 1 was
a bot that tweeted weather reports, and 1 was a bot that tweeted NHL hockey scores.
While we
could not detect every bot, all of the job posting bots included “job”, “career”, “work”, “join”,
or “tmj” in their name (and none of the other accounts did),
so we could easily scan for other
bots in the full data set. We found that a large percentage of one-place accounts were job posting
bots; complete statistics are shown in table 3.1.
Of course, there are plenty of spam accounts on Twitter besides job posting bots. Some of them,
like realistic-looking accounts made to promote a product, are difficult to filter out. However, we
point out the job bots to show one easy way that researchers who are analyzing geotagged tweets
can easily remove a large quantity of tweets that may not be relevant to their purposes.

In Study 1, we found that social media users often toggled geotagging, which suggests that people
may have nuanced views of privacy and sharing.
However,
there have also been news articles
indicating that people sometimes accidentally shared geotagged media too.
We were interested
in probing these behaviors more. Towards this end, we conducted a survey of Twitter users.
In November 2014, we compiled a list of our users, sorted by the number of times they tweeted
in our data set. After our study was approved by our IRB, we recruited 4119 participants to take
a survey by tweeting a link to them.
We started from the most prolific tweeters in order to make
sure we had active users. A total of 78 responded and were paid with a $5 Amazon.com gift card
for participating.
(While we wish we could have had a higher response rate,
we considered it
appropriate for an exploratory survey.) Survey questions are listed in 3.2.
Free-response survey
questions were analyzed using affinity diagramming,
as described in [8].
This technique,
in
which all main points from responses are printed out on post-it notes and grouped iteratively
according to main themes, allowed us to find higher-level themes that emerged from the data in
a bottom-up manner.
We intended this as a preliminary study; because we had just been studying users’ public tweets,
hearing from them directly would be helpful.
However, we also realized that only studying on
one platform limited our results.
While we started from the most prolific users and recruited
down the list,
this reflects a diverse array of active users:
our users had between 57 and 2766
tweets over the course of our one-year time period (median=293).

HY THEY GEOTAG
The most popular reasons people gave for geotagging their tweets were to communicate with
and to show off their travels and events to followers. Of our 78 participants, 17 people described
geotagging their tweets at an event,
9 described geotagging while traveling,
and 18 described
a more general desire “To show my followers where I am.” This latter set of users described
choosing whether to geotag each tweet, rather than simply leaving it on. This diversity of reasons
inspired us to look deeper into reasons behind geotagging, which we do in Study 3.

OME USERS DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE GEOTAGGING
Surprisingly, nine participants reported being unaware that they were posting geotagged tweets,
while six more reported accidentally turning it on at some point and then consciously deciding to
leave it on. Four were persuaded to start geotagging by an app and 10 decided to start geotagging
on a whim or out of curiosity.
One major reason that people may be unaware of their geotagging is the presence of third-party
apps that post geotagged tweets. Two users mentioned that they cross-post geotagged Instagram
photos to Twitter,
while a third uses a Wordpress plugin that cross-posts blog posts.
This user
was surprised to learn that she had been geotagging at all.
Third-party Twitter clients are also
possible causes: one person who used the Tweetbot client (an app for reading and posting tweets)
mentioned that Tweetbot enables geotagging by default.

OME DID NOT KNOW THEIR GEOTAGS

PRECISION
Most participants expressed some concerns about privacy, including vague feelings that they did
not want to tell the world where they were (15 participants), or that they specifically did not want
the world to know when they were not at home (8 participants).
Several explicitly mentioned
potential burglaries. These concerns echo previous location privacy findings [92].
However,
20 participants expressed very little concern about privacy.
Worryingly,
12 of these
participants expressed belief they were only sharing broad city-level locations, and thought that
nobody knew their exact location.
However,
everyone in our data set,
including these 12,
had
posted public tweets with precise coordinate geotags.
Upon further investigation, we found that the Twitter mobile app showed a confusing user inter-
face: it appeared that users would be posting high-level tags (like “Pittsburgh, PA”) when instead
the actual latitude-longitude point was stored with the tweet. As noted earlier, the Twitter mobile
app’s user interface has since been changed to use placetags.

papers about why this topic in location-based social networks [14, 28, 53, 54], we wanted to see
if their findings about why people check in can be replicated in geotags in non-location-based
social networks.
As such,
we asked them to pull up their most recent geotagged post in any
social media and asked them, “Please explain in detail why you geotagged,” with a free response
answer.
We also asked, more generally, “What are your motivations for geotagging? (check all
that apply)” and offered the choices in table 3.3.
We recruited 406 people from Amazon Mechanical
Turk to ask them about
their geotagging
practices and their most recent geotag on their most used social media service.
We recruited
participants who were in the United States and had previously geotagged at
least
once.
We
asked about the content of their most recent post with geotag:
what type of post it was (text,
picture, etc), what it was about, why they posted it, and how meaningful it was.
We asked about
the geotag:
what the geotag was,
how precise it was,
how they would describe the place they
geotagged, why they geotagged, what their motivations for geotagging are, how often they go to
the place, how far it is from where they live, and how long they waited to post it. The study took
about 5 minutes and participants were paid $1. Six people’s responses had to be removed as their
free responses indicated they were not paying attention, leaving us with 400 valid responses.

ESULTS
For reasons of space and conciseness, we will not report on all of the survey questions, instead
highlighting some of the most surprising and relevant findings here.
3.8.1
W
HEN DO THEY GEOTAG
?
Most of our participants reported geotagging in the moment, mostly within an hour of the photo
or event they are sharing. If not, they usually geotag by the end of the day: 69.0% geotag within
an hour, 89.3% within a day (see table 3.4 for details).
However, a substantial amount waited,
for reasons like wanting to ‘settle down (at hotel)’ , ‘find phone service signal’, or posting upon
friends’ request.
This suggests a slight difference between geotags and check-ins, due to the concept of “check-in
transience” introduced by Guha and Birnholtz [28].
Check-ins have a short lifespan;
it would
rarely make sense to check in later in the day or week.
However, about 1/3 of our respondents
waited over an hour to share their geotagged post.
3.8.2
W
HERE DO THEY GEOTAG
?
Our participants mostly geotagged in places far from home, as shown in Figure 3.6.
When we
asked about the most recent geotag, only 11.9% of them were in the users’ home or neighbor-
hood,
and 46.7% were in their home city.
Johnson et
al
[39] found similar findings:
that
in
Twitter, Flickr, and Swarm, only about 75% of posts are from “local” users, but ours are more
extreme; depending on how one defines “local,” anywhere between 11.9% to 46.7% of geotags
are from “local” users.
Furthermore, 70.0% of these geotags are from rare places:
places they
go every year, a few times so far, or this is the first time.
This confirms the finding in [53] that
many people are reluctant to check in at routine places, and the finding in [14] that users avoid
checking-in to home and work because it can be annoying.
20
Figure 3.6: Where participants geotag.
Note that most people geotag far from their home: only
11.9% tag in their home neighborhood,
and less than half are in their home city.
Most people
also geotag in places that they visit rarely: 70% of these geotags happen in places that people go
annually or less frequently.
3.8.3
W
HY DO THEY GEOTAG
?
We asked users twice why they geotag: once in general (responses are shown in Figure 3.7) and
once about specifically why they geotagged their last post.
The options shown in Figure 3.7
are based on previous research,
as explained in Table 3.3.
We can see that few people chose
“other”, which suggests that these choices explained people’s preferences well.
In addition, few
people geotag automatically, which corroborates our finding in Study 1.
The sharp difference in
magnitude between the top two reasons and the rest adds some nuance to our knowledge:
the
most commonly cited reasons for geotagging are the social-driven ones (“show I was at a cool
place” and “keep family/friends updated”), more than the purpose-driven ones.
We analyzed the free response question about why they geotagged their last post using affinity
diagramming (as described in [8],
as we did in study 2.)
The categories that emerged almost
all fit into one of the six choices shown in Figure 3.7.
The two categories that didn’t fit were
“No reason” and “Application-driven”; we give some examples in Table 3.5. We note that these,
too, have some precedent in the literature; users describe “checking-in” as something to do when
bored and are motivated by game elements included in LBSNs [53].

EOTAGS ARE POSTCARDS
,
NOT TICKET STUBS
Our studies brought us some findings that, unsurprisingly, agree with research on LBSNs. People
geotag to show where they’ve been; keep their family and friends updated on their travels; record
a place for later; or help family, friends, and strangers to find a place. People geotag at rare places
more than routine places.
However, our studies add some depth and nuance to our understanding of geotagging.
Showing
off where they were and keeping family and friends updated rank as the most important reasons to
geotag. In addition, we document for the first time that most people geotag consciously; they do

No Reason
“No specific reason, just because I wanted to share the dealership where I was buying the
car.”
“No particular reason other than I tend to enjoy seeing the geotags of my friends so I
decided to include it myself.”
“Just because I wanted to, no reason in particular, just something to do.”
“I didn’t really think of it,
I just kind of did it...doesn’t that explain most of what is on
social media? Just because...”
Application-driven
“the geotag put the houston dynamo colors and logo over the picture”
“to get a discount off my melon boba tea.”
“To remind myself where I found the pokemon, as well as letting my friends know that it
could be a good spot for the future.”
“...it’s how I find interesting people to follow and I’m sure its how I have gained followers
too [on Instagram]”

not simply set their phone to automatically geotag everything, as we saw in Studies 1 and 3. This
was not an issue in LBSN research,
because using an app like Foursquare without geotagging
would not even make sense.
But in non-location based social networks, it is important to know
whether a geotag is a side effect of another action,
like a ticket stub,
or a consciously chosen
artifact, like a postcard.
Our research shows that a geotag can be seen as a postcard: it shows that a person is at a certain
place, it is usually used for social communication, and it is hard (though not impossible) to fake.
In addition, our studies uncovered three new important points:
•
The landscape of geotagging is changing, from coordinate geotags to placetags
•
Some people may not know that they’re geotagging, or how precisely they’re geotagging
•
New types of spammers are becoming prevalent in public geotagged data
In the rest of this section, we will discuss the implications of these findings for different groups.
3.9.2
I
MPLICATIONS FOR APPLICATIONS AND APP DEVELOPERS
There are clearly pitfalls to avoid when designing an application that involves users’ locations.
Many papers have documented the risks, e.g. [92]. In this paper, we documented two more risks:
the possibility that users are coordinate geotagging when they think they are placetagging (as in
Twitter before April 2015), and third-party apps that add geotags with people’s knowledge.
In
this section, we propose ways to avoid these harms and improve users’ geotagging experience.
M
INIMIZE AUTOMATIC TAGS AND COORDINATE GEOTAGS
To avoid accidental privacy leaks, social media software needs to be more careful when automat-
ically geotagging participants’ posts.
For some apps,
such as the old Foursquare check-in app
(now Swarm), geotagging is the main purpose of the app, and so it makes sense to have automatic
geotags.
However, in Study 2, we also reported on two examples where people’s mental models
and expectations about geotagging did not match reality.
This point is obvious and straightforward. Less obviously, social media software might consider
whether they want geotagging to be a sticky setting at all.
That is, if a person geotags one post,
should the next post be geotagged by default? Our results suggest no:
people largely prefer to
make a conscious choice about whether to geotag each post or not.
This choice adds only slight
overhead, and prevents potentially disastrous privacy leaks.
Another option to reduce privacy risks is to use placetags instead of coordinate geotags.
All of
our participants’ main use cases could usually be handled by placetags, and coordinate geotags
are often too precise, revealing more of a user’s location than they want.
Only the “coordinate
with friends” and “keep track of this place for later” cases might require a coordinate geotag, and
then only if it’s in a wilderness area or other place without well-defined places.
Using placetags could improve the user experience in other ways as well, as coordinate geotags
are usually hard for people to understand. Many services, like Twitter and Facebook, are already
doing this well:
users can select which granularity to placetag, whether it’s the building or city
24
that
they are in.
They can also add their exact
location if they want.
A minor challenge is
that coordinate tags can be generated solely on a smartphone through GPS, whereas placetags
require network services and a large database that needs to be kept up to date to do lookups of
place names.
H
ELP RESEARCHERS UNDERSTAND PLACETAGS
One notable downside of placetags, however, is their interpretability. If a researcher sees a plac-
etag that
says ”Starbucks” without
any finer grained information,
how can they know which
Starbucks location the user is at? Also, sometimes placetags represent coarse places, like “Sin-
gapore,” but researchers interpret them as being finer-grained points. They sometimes transform
a bounding box into one point at the center, which can have annoying or even disastrous conse-
quences, as Shamma documents [79].
Services need to return geotags at different granularities:
cities, polygons, or points.
They also need to document why they are returning the granularity
that they are: because the user chose it, because the user’s GPS could not get an accurate reading,
because of the user’s default privacy settings, or whatever other reason.
While it would be computationally expensive to send an entire polygon with every social media
point, it would be feasible to publish a gazetteer of places along with a social media API. Services
may be tempted to send bounding boxes instead, but this could lead to other problems, such as
Mapzen accidentally declaring Copenhagen part of Sweden [80].
Importantly,
this is not an appeal to altruism;
researchers are internal as well as external.
Im-
proving the comprehensibility of placetags for researchers will help a company’s own analysts
as well as the academic community.

MPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS
Many studies have treated geotag data as sensor data,
without
much regard for how it
came
to be.
For some use cases,
this is sufficient,
but
in other situations,
more care is needed in
drawing conclusions from geotagged social media data.
Below, we discuss some salient issues
for researchers in using geotagged data.
A

ECREASING
Publicly visible geotagged social media may seem like an endless source of rich data. However,
as we saw in Study 1,
Twitter has fewer coordinate geotags available,
and even Flickr geotags
may be plateauing.
Additionally, our participants in Study 3 geotagged primarily on Facebook,
Instagram, and Foursquare, but these services do not publish public “firehose” APIs for gathering
data.
Furthermore, the geotags that are still present are getting stranger: job posting bots, weather and
sports bots,
deleted accounts,
and other accounts are creating a growing fraction of all public
geotagged tweets.
As a result,
it is not clear how much more research can be done with coordinate geotags.
In
addition,
for the coordinate geotags that
are available,
it
is important
to dig in and filter out
whatever spam may be prevalent.
25
An alternative is that researchers may need to become more comfortable dealing with placetags.
For example, it is important to avoid the center-of-rectangle problem mentioned in the previous
section.
The semantics of a placetag may also vary by application.
A few general principles
include realizing that the data available at the building or neighborhood level will likely be much
smaller than the data at the city level, and the data at the point level smaller still.
G
EOTAG PROVENANCE AFFECTS RESEARCH METHODS
It is important to treat geotagging as a performative act, not a passive one.
As Study 2 showed,
most people consciously decide to geotag each time;
as Study 3 showed,
people use geotags
mostly to show off where they have been,
keep family and friends updated,
and occasionally
coordinate with friends or save a place for later. The content of their tags often reflects vacations
or meals at restaurants. As a result, it is a rich data set to study where people go on vacation, eat
out, or have places that they want to save for later.
However, it does not seem to be a rich data
set to study users’ everyday lives.
As an example of a use case where the provenance of these tweets matters,
we point to [87].
In this work, the authors tried to find users’ home addresses given a sample of their geotagged
tweets.
If tweets represented a random sample of places the user has been, this would be trivial,
because most tweets would occur at users’ homes. However, they found that this was impossible
for about 15% of Twitter users,
because they recently moved,
never tweeted at home,
or had
other complicated use cases.
They reference Krumm [47],
who previously attempted to find
home addresses based on GPS sensors on cars.
Naturally, with the same methods, the GPS on
the car worked much better, because those readings come from a passive and automatic sensor,
not a performative act.
But the fact that geotags come from unusual occasions doesn’t only limit research;
it can add
extra context to a post.
For example,
many geotagged tweets come from Untappd,
an app for
beer aficionados to share their experiences of fine beers. While Untappd tweets tell us less about
the general public’s day to day movement, they tell us more about local beer loving communities
and, potentially, the sociability of a place. Likewise, the fact that people often geotag on vacation
or while out to dinner may provide clues to activity recognition and computer vision algorithms.
We encourage researchers to find questions that can take advantage of the rich variety of sources
that geotagged tweets provide.
3.10
C
ONCLUSION
While checking in in location-based social networks has become a widely researched topic, moti-
vations behind geotagging in other social media have not been as fully analyzed. We investigated
if people geotagged their social media posts for the same reasons that they checked in on LB-
SNs, and for the most part found that they do. Geotags are postcards, not ticket stubs; conscious
choices,
not byproducts.
People geotag their social media posts to show off where they are or
communicate with family and friends.
They geotag in faraway and rare places.
However, in our
research we found reasons, especially recently, why researchers and developers must be careful.
Researchers should be aware that counts of coordinate geotags are shrinking and specific types
of spam are rising, while developers should show their users clearly what they are posting, avoid
26
sticky geotagging settings, and prioritize placetags over coordinates.
Returning to our research questions, these findings show that geotagged social media posts are
likely to be useful to show glimpses into a world. Because they are provided by a small subset of
the users of any particular social network (who are in turn a small subset of a population), they
are less useful for demographics or other statistics about a population as a whole.
This suggests
that they will be likely to be a valuable resource for travelers more than for city planners or other
officials.

After surveying what we know about social media, I turn now to the question of how it can help
travelers.
But before answering that,
it is important to understand these new tourists’ motives.
In this chapter, I address the question, “What do these new travelers mean by ‘get a feel for the
city’?” How can we operationalize this vague concept to help them find what they’re looking
for?
In this chapter, I detail two studies:
first interviews with 14 creative tourists, then surveys with
490 more creative tourists,
to find out what they are looking for.
The model that emerged has
five parts:
safety,
convenience,
liveliness,
aesthetic appeal,
and the ability to live like locals.
This further informed the design of the Neighborhood Guides application and future research, as
described in chapters 5, 6, and 7.
4.1
I
NTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The sharing economy has revolutionized the tourism industry.
Apps like Airbnb, Couchsurfing,
and HomeAway allow people to match up with locals and stay at their homes. Airbnb now boasts
over 60 million users staying at over 2 million listings [1], Couchsurfing has over 10 million users
[2], and HomeAway has 1.2 million listings [3].
Mobile and web technology, user reviews, and
social media have combined to enable people to stay in tons of new places.
At the same time, a growing body of research suggests that modern urban travelers want to travel
in new ways:
they want
to experience “everyday life” in a city and “do what
the locals do.”
Unlike the sun-and-sand tourists of two generations ago or the cultural-site-visiting tourists of
last generation, today’s tourists want to curate and create their own experience. Choosing unique
lodging is one way they can do so. However, travelers often don’t know what neighborhoods they
might like to stay in. The plentiful lodging around the city gives travelers an overwhelming array
of choice, and without local knowledge of a place, travelers don’t know where to start looking.
Tools that are available to address these information needs all fall short.
Traditional guidebooks
from Fodor’s, Frommer’s, and Lonely Planet give people information about those central tourist
districts and sights to see. Yelp and Foursquare give people information about the businesses, the
bars and restaurants and locksmiths, in an area, but travelers cannot easily understand how the
whole neighborhood feels just from that. Cities gather statistics - and indeed, are releasing open
data more than ever before - but numbers also fail to convey a neighborhood’s culture.
Finally,
occasionally travelers can learn local vernacular descriptions,
but these are often shallow.
For
example, “Lawrenceville is the cool neighborhood” or “South Side is the party neighborhood.”
In order to design tourist guides of the future to help people renting through the sharing economy,
we conducted two studies of travelers. We first interviewed 24 people who have recently traveled
or moved to another city.
We then surveyed 490 people (98 recruited via social
media and
28
392 users of Airbnb) to better understand what they want to know about neighborhoods.
We
developed a five-dimension model of what users want in neighborhood search:
safety, location
convenience, liveliness, the ability to live like locals, and aesthetic appeal.
This model, and the
understanding built through the qualitative and quantitative studies, will help us design modern
neighborhood guides to help these travelers.

NTERVIEWS
For this research,
we employed a mixed methods approach,
gaining qualitative insights from
interactive interviews,
which we adjusted and confirmed with quantitative data from surveys
(described later as Study 2). We began with interviews of 24 participants.
In these interviews, we focused on the following research questions:
•
What do people want to know about neighborhoods when they’re traveling?
•
What do people want to know about neighborhoods when they’re moving? (Note: we later
removed the movers from our sample to focus on travelers.)
•
What do people wish travelers and movers knew about their neighborhood?
We recruited 17 participants in Pittsburgh who all
recently traveled or moved by posting our
study on Reddit, Craigslist, and Facebook.
We asked them to describe their search process and
their experience finding a neighborhood to stay or live. We then showed them printed pages about
the neighborhoods they moved from or traveled to: popular Twitter words that are more common
in that neighborhood than others, Flickr photos obtained by searching the neighborhood names
on Twitter,
the top 10 most
popular venues on Yelp,
and market
research and statistics from
the Tapestry guide produced by GIS company ESRI
1
. We asked them to create two one-page
guides (one for the neighborhood they moved from/traveled to,
and one for the neighborhood
they currently live in) by cutting and taping these materials, and writing or drawing in anything
that was missing.
This was meant as an elicitation exercise to get them thinking about these
neighborhoods in more depth. Our university’s Institutional Review Board approved this study.
After these 17 interviews, of which 7 involved recent travelers and 10 involved recent movers, we
realized one recurring issue: location guides often matter more to travelers than movers. Movers
care about many factors in addition to the neighborhood:
the house or apartment itself, the cost
of rent or a mortgage, the proximity to an existing job, and the local schools.
They also tend to
have much more time to investigate neighborhoods before moving there. Some of their concerns
still echo the travelers’ concerns, so we retained their data, but we reoriented the project to focus
on travelers.
We recruited seven more recent travelers in San Francisco, bringing the total to 24 participants.
For this second group, we did the same interview, but focused more on factors that seemed rele-
vant in the first one: safety, liveliness, diversity, and aesthetics.
We also only recruited travelers
for the second group.
We did not bring the printouts or ask participants to create flyers like we
did for the first group, because the extra work did not provide much more value or insight.

We will refer to the original 17 interviewees as A1-A17,
and the next seven as B1-B7.
Basic
information about these participants is included in Table 4.1. Interviews were conducted in cafes
or other public places near them for convenience and to get them thinking about their neighbor-
hoods.
B5 and B6, a dating couple, interviewed together; all the rest were done separately.
Our
participants are mostly in their 20s and 30s, which are also the age groups most likely to try a
home-sharing site like Airbnb or Couchsurfing, according to a 2016 Pew Internet report [81].
Because the interviews occurred in public places, we could not record them, but we took notes
to capture important
points as well
as possible.
After finishing each batch of interviews,
we
analyzed the data iteratively,
using an open coding approach to allow insights to emerge from
the data.
In this method, as described by Strauss and Corbin [83], a researcher iteratively reads
through notes,
such as statements or opinions from participants,
and applies codes to describe
higher-level themes relating to these notes. After completing all the notes, the researcher re-reads
the notes and re-codes them until they reach convergence.
In this way, the higher-level themes
can emerge from the data.
These interviews revealed a lot about this group’s travel and moving motivations, what they hope
to learn about neighborhoods, and where they decide to stay, as well as a few interesting tensions
that
arise when they make those decisions.
We built
a six-part
model
of tourist
information
search, which we then refined and verified with our next study.
4.2.1

OURIST NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH MODEL
1.0
After coding interviewees’ responses,
we came up with a six-dimension model that it seemed
users would search on.
We describe it here for clarity,
though we will later introduce a more
validated model that we believe to be more accurate.
To reduce redunancy, we also offer more
details about these dimensions by combining the results of these interviews with the results of
our later survey.
Our participants wanted to search for neighborhoods along the following dimensions:
1.
Safety: how easy it is to avoid crime or other trouble
2.
Diversity: how diverse the people are who live there
3.
Walkability: how easy it is to get around by walking
4.
Aesthetic Appeal: how nice the neighborhood looks
5.
Third Places:
how wide and deep a selection of bars, cafes, and other social places exists
in the neighborhood. (We use the term “third places” as introduced by Oldenburg [66].)
6.
Authenticity:
participants defined this in many different ways,
often invoking a duality
with “touristiness” (an “authentic” and desirable place was one that was not “touristy.”)
We define authenticity more precisely when discussing the later model.

•
Is our six-dimension model of tourist neighborhood search complete, or have we missed
any important dimensions?
•
Are all six dimensions necessary?
•
How important is each dimension?
The survey asked participants which of our six dimensions was the most important thing when
they are finding a place to stay (with an option for “other”),
then asked them more nuanced
questions about the relative importance of each one. These questions were taken from key points
people brought up during the interviews; for each of our six dimensions, we created 2-4 questions
based on that dimension. The survey questions are shown in Table 4.2.
We recruited participants in two batches.
In the first batch, we recruited on Facebook, Twitter,
Reddit, Craigslist, and Slack, and through a participant pool at our university.
This survey was
approved by our Institutional Review Board. The survey took about 10 minutes, and participants
were entered into a drawing for one of five $50 Amazon.com gift cards.
We received 98 re-
sponses. For the second batch, our collaborators at Airbnb, Inc., sent the survey to some of their
users and received 392 responses.

A number of conditions may cause travelers to do very little research before choosing where to
stay. If someone already has a place to stay, they will likely take that. B2 described this as a “bird
in the hand” situation, and said it occurred a lot when Couchsurfing: finding a local who’s willing
to host him for free can be difficult, so he will usually accept, regardless of circumstances.
If a traveler has social or other constraints, such as friends or family to visit or an event to attend,
they usually consider tourism secondary and stay somewhere nice near that constraint.
B5 and
B6 described going to the X Games,
an extreme sports event,
in Aspen,
Colorado:
they spent
most of their time watching events,
so they simply wanted to stay near the games.
Similarly,
B4 described visiting Scottsdale, Arizona, on per sonal business, which led to him staying in the
Fashion Square district.
He found it rather unpleasant,
and had trouble getting around,
but he
needed to be near there.
Finally,
budget constraints would often short-circuit the lodging search.
B5 and B6 described
another trip, when they went to Seattle but wanted to pick the cheapest lodging possible.
This
ended up being the Green Tortoise Hostel downtown, and since they had stayed in another Green
Tortoise elsewhere, they decided it would work.
B3 also described a road trip where he simply
looked up a place to stay while on the road each day, only wanting something simple, clean, and
cheap.

We did this by per-
forming factor analysis on our survey questions. Five eigenvalues of the correlation matrix were
greater than 1 in both datasets,
so after performing factor analysis with 5 factors,
loadings are
shown in Table 4.3.
We will explain these dimensions in the next section.

C
URRENT NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH TOOLS ARE INADEQUATE
Given that these five dimensions matter in different ways for different searchers, how do travelers
search for neighborhoods now?
The primary search method participants said they used was to ask friends and family.
If people
visited friends,
like B2 in Albuquerque and Portland,
they can do this directly; otherwise,
like
A9, they would ask friends beforehand what were interesting and fun neighborhoods.
Online research was also widely used, often as simply as searching Google for “things to do in
London” or “London off the beaten path” (B6). B7 lamented, though, that this kind of searching
can turn the usually-fun process of traveling into work.
Because searching was so labor intensive, some people who did not have any pre-existing heuris-
tics (as described above) tried to create their own heuristics. A11 would search for the “queerest
neighborhood” in a given city, as she did when she visited Zurich.
This was not in order to find
particular sites there (Zurich’s queerest neighborhood featured one main gay bar and one main
sex shop, neither of which she visited), but just because she found that she would often like the
kind of people she met there.
Similarly, B1 searched for the best coffee shops, not because she
would spend most of her time there, but because she usually likes neighborhoods that have good
coffee shops. B2 would read books about a place, like Gregory David Roberts’s novel Shantaram
before visiting Mumbai, or Maya Angelou before visiting San Francisco, in order to recognize
places they mentioned.

The meaning of safety varied slightly depending on location; usually it included crime, but A1,
A15,
A17,
and B4 all mentioned fear of bedbugs when traveling to New York.
People’s inter-
pretations of “safety” varied, too, depending on the type of crime and individual thresholds.
A2
mentioned the distinction between “drug deal gone bad” vs. “random” crime, A5 looked up mur-
der rates rather than crime rates because those were the crimes that mattered the most, and B4
didn’t really care about most crime, except, “I just don’t want to get shot at.” On the other hand,
A6 rerouted a whole itinerary through France after hearing that Marseille, one of their planned
destinations, was “unsafe.”
When asked if safety was always an upside, many participants declined.
A6 described spending
one night in Churchill Gardens,
a posh part of London,
but then moving on to somewhat sim-
pler Clerkenwell.
Often the safest spaces are also the most expensive, and because they are so
expensive, only a homogenous set of wealthy people can live there.

ONVENIENCE
We define the “location convenience” of a place as how easy it is for a traveler staying at that
place to get to everywhere they want to go.
This concept emerged from our survey results; we
had missed it in the interviews,
in favor of the concept of “walkability.” Walkability is part of
location convenience:
if a place is easy to walk around, then it will be easy to get to attractions
and daily necessities. Especially in a foreign place, where one might not have a car or understand
local public transport, walking to something is often the easiest way to get there.
However, location convenience extends beyond walkability, depending on the local transporta-
tion options and the traveler’s trip.
A1 and B1 both talked about the extensive subway in New
York City; A1 noted that she did not feel compelled to stay in central Midtown as long as she
was near a subway, while B1 preferred taking subways to walking because it was an interesting
experience in itself. Perceptions of location convenience change with mode of transportation and
circumstance, too.
B5 and B6 described going to Aspen, Colorado together to see the Winter X
Games extreme sports competition. Three areas, Aspen, Buttermilk, and Snowmass, had lodging
options, but the only transport between them and the X Games site was by bus, and Buttermilk
and Snowmass required an extra bus ride to get to Aspen.
B5 and B6 focused their search on
Aspen itself, because it would require one bus ride per day instead of two.
Naturally, in a less
crowded time of the year, Buttermilk and Snowmass would be more location convenient.
Location convenience for travelers is related to location efficiency for people living in a place
[33].
Location-efficient places are dense places with good public transit access, where residents
will be less likely to need to own a car.
Location efficiency and location convenience are not
exactly the same, as travelers have a different set of priorities (for example, getting to a tourist
destination rather than a job, or a restaurant rather than a grocery store), but they are quite similar.
We did not ask specifically about location convenience in Study 2; its inclusion came out of the
“other” responses.
Of the 23 “other” responses from the Airbnb group, 13 were about location
convenience, as were 2 of the 4 “other” responses in the general public group. Also, as walkabil-
ity was the second most common choice as the most important dimension (see Figure 4.1), we
assume that location convenience would be the second most common choice if we had included
38
it instead.

IVELINESS
Our participants mostly appreciated lively places.
This intuitively makes sense, as they traveled
to cities;
the trips they discussed are not “sun and sand” getaway trips.
Lively places have a
number of advantages:
there are usually businesses nearby,
so it
is easy to accomplish daily
tasks; there are fewer safety concerns; they are often interesting in their own right due to markets
or street performers.
“Liveliness” encompasses what we previously referred to as “diversity”
because the street is an equalizing place, as Jacobs writes [35].
All kinds of people can meet on
a street; as A1 and B1 said, their favorite places allow “room for everyone.”
Liveliness thus includes some of the components of diversity, some components of walkability,
and some components of third places.
Some participants offered examples of lively places they
enjoyed: B1 enjoyed train stations, while she and B6 both brought up markets. Others described
liveliness in their own words: “being in the middle of stuff” (B4), “having stuff around” (A15),
or being “where everything is” (A9).
Liveliness makes traveling more pleasant
and enables
serendipitous encounters too. B6 talked about visiting New Orleans and stumbling across parades
put together by local Native American groups, which she unexpectedly enjoyed.
Similarly, B7
described how she preferred staying in the residential Itzimna neighborhood over the center of
Merida,
because she enjoyed her 20-30 minute walk to the center every day and the chance
encounters it brings.

OCALS
This dimension may be the most complex, as it includes two related ideas: the authenticity of a
place and the opportunity to experience everyday life.
Due to its complexity, we will discuss it
in two parts.
A
UTHENTICITY
This dimension represents how closely people can simulate a “normal”, non-traveling life there,
and approximates notions of “authenticity.” Many participants expressed desires for an “authen-
tic” “non-touristy” place. Clearly, “touristy” places have some disadvantages: they are expensive
(B6 gave the example of paying £39 to see the Crown Jewels in London) and often people act
differently there (B7 described feeling like she “had a dollar sign on her forehead” in the tourist
beaches of Cancun).
But those inconveniences do not explain the intensity of the desire to be
“not a tourist” (or even “the anti-tourist”, as A9 described himself).
Furthermore, some people
appreciated touristy places,
for practical reasons:
B7 noted that not speaking Spanish limited
her experience in Mexico, and A6 described how she would search for a place that’s not the #1
tourist destination but also not completely local, due to language issues.
To understand this touristiness tension, it is useful to review previous work about authenticity in
tourist places. Early work located all spaces on a 6-stage scale from front-stage (purely for show)
to backstage (fully authentic) and predicted that all tourists would seek authenticity [56].
Later
work added more nuance,
describing the “authenticity” of an experience in nine subtypes de-
pending on how authentic the place was, how authentic the people were, and whether the visitor
39
put importance on the authenticity of the people or the place,
both,
or neither [68].
Further-
more, the authenticity of an experience may be best explained as existential authenticity, or the
personal resonance with that experience.
Existential authenticity has two forms:
intra-personal
(discovering and being true to oneself) and inter-personal (having a real connection to others)
[95].
For example, different people may enjoy a trip to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam for many
reasons.
They may appreciate seeing the original Sunflowers (objective authenticity) or seeing
the official, definitive collection of Van Gogh’s art (constructive authenticity). They may enjoy a
stirring resonance with Van Gogh’s masterful brushstrokes, or the ability to discuss these paint-
ings with their fellow tourists (existential
authenticity,
intra- and inter-personal
respectively).
They might get useful information from the docents in an official, front-stage capacity, or they
might get a docent to reveal little-known backstage stories about working at the museum. Finally,
afterwards, they may stay in the enclavic tourist “bubble” of the Museumplein outside, or they
may head to a more heterogeneous neighborhood, as described in [22]. Each of these experiences
may be regarded by one person as “authentic” and by another as “touristy.”
T
HIRD
P
LACES
Another recurring theme was described as “taking in the city life” (B1),
seeing “what people
actually do here” (A9), “kind of get[ting] a feel” of the city (A6), and even “play[ing] the game
of, what if we lived here” (A17).
This echoes a trend towards travelers using the everyday as a
way to create their experience, for the travel experience to be less about what they are consuming
and more about what they are becoming [57]. Most participants (except A16) were not traveling
in order to find a place to move to, but they still enjoyed pretending to do so.
When pressed,
though,
interviewees did not actually want their travel experiences to be about
the real “everyday.” Everyday life involves work,
chores,
and errands that most people do not
enjoy, wherever they are.
For example, asked if she would be interested to see everyday life in
the Financial District of San Francisco, B1 replied no, the Financial District isn’t the kind of “ev-
eryday” she’s looking for (though clearly it is an integral part of many people’s everyday lives).
Instead,
participants wanted to experience an “ideal
everyday,” which involved two recurring
subthemes: relaxation and third places.
Relaxation is self-explanatory: travelers, usually on leisure trips, preferred a slow-paced day with
few responsibilities to a quick, busy day. A1 appreciated a relaxing or “chill” environment, as did
B1, who elaborated that, as a busy professor, she often doesn’t get a chance to do the “everyday”
things that are part of this ideal day. She gave an example of buying a birthday card for a friend:
she plans to do this on an upcoming trip to visit friends, just because that will be the only time
she has to do it.
Third places,
such as bars,
cafes,
and bookstores as described in [66],
are also a key part
of
this “ideal everyday.” Many participants described local venues they loved:
a coffeeshop and a
taqueria (A13), cafes where one can see friends sitting outside (A14), cafes and dive bars (B4).
B1 went as far as to suggest that she would travel to a place based on where the best coffee
shops were.
Because third places tend to be neutral, accessible, status-leveling places, travelers
40
appreciate them.
Stepping into everyday life in another place involves adjustments,
and these
third places give travelers a way to recharge.
After our factor analysis of the survey results (see Table 4.3,
we realized that the concepts of
authenticity and third places,
which we had assumed to be separate,
really reflected the same
underlying emotion:
travelers want to be able to be part of a different place,
to experience a
different life instead of just seeing some different things.
Therefore,
we combined these two
dimensions into one overall theme of “living like locals.”

Aesthetic appeal in many forms is one of the main incentives for people to travel,
and one of
the main influences on the overall feeling of a trip.
By “aesthetic appeal”,
we are referring to
anything about the senses: participants mentioned visual, auditory, and gustatory appeal particu-
larly, and occasionally smell. Some preferences were universal, such as enjoyment of nature and
avoidance of loud places while sleeping. Others were personal: A10 described her neighborhood
as a burgeoning urban agricultural area, while A4 described the city of Pittsburgh as a “concrete
jungle.” Many participants described suburbs as “boring”,
but A7 described one suburb as his
“perspective of what country living should be.”

PPORTUNITIES
This model provides both deep insight into how new urban tourists search for neighborhoods to
stay in,
and shows ways forward to make guides to better serve them.
In this section,
we will
discuss some design recommendations for these systems.
4.6.1
F
OCUS ON AREAS
,
NOT POINTS
Current tourist guides focus on individual places.
Tourist sites,
restaurants,
shows,
shops,
and
bars are all approached as if one had a perfectly rational choice between them.
Searching for
Indian food on Yelp results in a list of nearby places, and a traveler can just pick the highest rated
option.
Plenty of the research we reviewed in this paper focuses on venue recommendation as
well.
But modern urban tourists, especially, want to know about interesting areas, not just interesting
points. They enjoy traveling by experiencing the ideal everyday life of an area, relaxing in cafes,
browsing shops, reading a book in a neighborhood park.
Reading about statistics or lists of top
10 restaurants will not help them find the neighborhood they would like.
As a result,
we see an opportunity for a higher level of abstraction.
One promising avenue is
comparison to neighborhoods in cities that they know. This is similar to work that has been done
both in research [51] and in popular culture [74].
Because people already know what neighbor-
hoods in their own city are like, this can give them an easy way to understand neighborhoods in
a new city.
41
4.6.2
S
AFETY AND LOCATION CONVENIENCE MAKE A LODGING OPTION GOOD ENOUGH
Travelers need to get around, and they need to be safe. These were almost universal requirements
from the participants that we spoke to, and the survey responses confirmed their importance. For-
tunately, these seem to be easy dimensions to address in an application. Safety can be addressed
using public crime data that many cities are already publishing.
Location convenience is a bit
more difficult, but services like Walkscore
2
and Mapnificent
3
are integrating walking and transit
to show how hard it really is to get around from a given place.
4.6.3
L
IVELINESS
,
LIVING LIKE LOCALS
,
AND AESTHETICS MAKE IT GREAT
After a place has passed a bar of “safe enough” and “convenient enough”, modern tourists are
looking for a lifestyle.
They want to experience the “ideal everyday” life in a place, they want
a place that’s exciting to walk around, they want a place that looks nice.
Unfortunately, includ-
ing these in an application is not quite as easy.
However,
social media offers some promising
possibilities.
First, liveliness can be approximated using residential density and location reviews on sites like
Yelp and Foursquare.
Denser places will be more lively and likely have more places, and more
reviews.
Some way to look into the words in those reviews would help too:
if there are tons of
bars that people are praising for their wild parties, that will give a neighborhood a different feel
than if it’s full of quiet restaurants or family-friendly cafes.
Second,
the ability to live like locals could be mined from Yelp,
Twitter and/or Flickr.
As we
described previously, “living like locals” involves at least two parts: the third places in the neigh-
borhood, and the neighborhood’s authenticity. Therefore, the reviews of third places in Yelp can
help.
Authenticity, though, is (as we reviewed) an ill-defined concept. Some part of authenticity
involves how many tourists and how many locals go there, which could be shown via a tool like
Eric Fischer’s “Tourists and Locals” maps
4
.
But this is not enough; authenticity is individual.
Perhaps an aggregation the tweets in an area could show something about what people talk about
in that area, and someone could decide if what people talk about is “authentic” or not.
Third, aesthetic appeal might be able to be described using Flickr photos. There are already 100
million photos publicly available through the YFCC100M dataset [89], and more through their
public API. More importantly, these photos have computer vision-based automatic tags, so one
can easily see which visual features (such as “car” or “dog” or “beach”) appear frequently in a
neighborhood.
Summarizing a neighborhood’s photo autotags could potentially help travelers
visually explore neighborhoods easily.

ONCLUSION
New urban tourists want to stay in interesting residential neighborhoods and spend time “wander-
ing about”, “taking in the city”, and “getting among the people” [6], and our participants echoed
these previous findings. To operationalize these desires, we conducted a series of interviews with

14 tourists (and 10 recent movers) and surveyed 490 travelers. We built the 5-dimensional model
of creative tourist information search:
tourists want safety,
location convenience,
aesthetic ap-
peal, liveliness, and the ability to live like locals.
In the next chapters I will explain how I used
this model to build a prototype neighborhood guide and run user studies based on it.

see which side of the city is reflected by the social media that is posted there.

The Neighborhood Guides application was conceptualized as a website that travelers could visit
while planning a trip.
It
contains information about
each neighborhood they might
consider
staying in.
The information included is based on the five-dimensional model of creative tourist information
search we built in the previous chapter.
Each dimension is represented by a data source from
social
media or another publicly available source.
Specifically,
to address the dimension of
safety,
we use crime statistics from city open data portals; to address convenience,
we include
information from Walkscore
1
;
to address aesthetic appeal,
we include photos from Flickr;
for
liveliness, counts of venues of different kinds from Foursquare; for the ability to live like locals,
common words from Twitter. These data sources are shown in Table 5.1.

HOICES
One important choice we had to make before beginning was which cities and neighborhoods to
include. We chose Pittsburgh and San Francisco because I was very familiar with them both, and
Chicago and Houston because they were reasonably large cities with plenty of data available.
For each city,
we used their open data portal to find neighborhood boundary data.
The portals
included the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center
2
for Pittsburgh, SF OpenData
3
, City of
Chicago Data Portal
4
, and Houston Data Portal
5
.
If they had multiple neighborhood boundary
data sets, we selected the one that seemed to be the most canonical or widely used.
One choice we made was to only use officially designated neighborhood boundaries.
Previous
projects like LiveHoods [18] and Hoodsquare [97] have found success using Foursquare checkins
to define socially-connected neighborhoods, but we consciously chose not to use these metrics
for a number of reasons.
Most prominently, we wanted them to have names that connected with
external data sources and people’s intuitions. For example, we wanted users to be learning about
“Squirrel Hill” or “The Mission”, not “LiveHood #34”.
This would aid in the external validity
of any information they learn while using the site.
In addition, using official boundaries deflects
responsibility from us.
People identify strongly with their neighborhoods and have strong opin-
ions about where their neighborhood ends and the next neighborhood begins; we wanted them
not to be distracted by these distinctions in our studies.
This site had a long vertical layout; users could see everything in Figures 5.1,
5.2,
and 5.3 by
scrolling up or down.

NFORMATION ABOUT EACH NEIGHBORHOOD

we used publicly available data from open data portals to describe
where the boundaries of each neighborhood lie. We then gathered information about each neigh-
borhood as follows.

RIME STATISTICS
Many cities now release easily-parseable crime reports, so we gathered one of these for each city.
In order to include a fair sample of each city without needing to correct for seasonal trends, we
took data from all of 2015, which was the latest year fully available. Most cities did not have this
data available by neighborhood, so we took a list of all crimes in each area and split them into
neighborhoods. We also categorized them using the FBI UCR Offense Definitions [63] into Part
I (more serious) and Part II (less serious) offenses, to help with the suggestions from participants
in chapter 4 that different types of crime may or may not worry them. We scaled these values by
the population of each neighborhood.
Eventually,
we had three values for each neighborhood:
Part I crime, Part II crime, and Total crime.

ALKSCORES
The company Walkscore
6
has built a Walkability index showing how easy it is to get to local busi-
nesses and amenities within walking distance. Their exact algorithm is proprietary, but according
to their website, the metric is calculated by counting the number of amenities in different cate-
gories within a 5-30 minute radius, where amenities within 5 minutes give the maximum score
and amenities outside 30 minutes do not add to an area’s score at all.
A Walk Score of 90-100
means “Daily errands do not require a car,” while 0-24 means “Almost all errands require a car.”
7
They similarly compute a Transit Score and Bike Score based on how easy it is to get around
using public transit and a bicycle.
In addition to providing a site where users can search for the Walk Score of any particular address,
Walkscore also publishes average Walk Scores of entire neighborhoods.
We used this data for
our prototype. If the neighborhoods that Walkscore uses did not match our official neighborhood
boundaries,
we adjusted them manually to bring the neighborhood lists into agreement.
(For
example, sometimes we combined two Walkscore neighborhoods, and averaged their scores, to
match one official neighborhood.) Walk Score is a rough metric, but previous studies show that
Walk Score explains as much variance for shopping as any other metric, and is comparable with
other walkability indices by other measures [58].

ESTHETIC APPEAL
: P
HOTOS FROM
F
LICKR
Aesthetic appeal is a rather subjective measure. Because different people have different views on
what a “beautiful” place looks like, we cannot distill it into a statistic as we distilled crime and
walkability. Therefore, we instead focused on providing users with a representative set of photos
of the neighborhood, so they could decide if they liked how it looked.
To do this, we used data from the YFCC100M dataset [89], as it contained 49 million geotagged
photos.
It also contains “autotags” for each photo:
tags denoting what is in the photo,
added
automatically by a computer-vision-based system.
These tags,
like “dog” or “building”,
let us
not only pick out photos in a given neighborhood, but also photos of a given subject in a given
neighborhood. This, then, let us pick out autotags that were unusually common in a given neigh-
borhood. We did so using the following algorithm.
Let Score
(
t
,
n
)
be the score for autotag t in neighborhood n.
Let C
t
,
n
be the count of photos that
have autotag t in neighborhood n.
Similarly, C
t
is the count of photos that have autotag t, C
n
is
the count of photos that are in neighborhood n,
and C is the count of photos in the entire city.
Then we define:
Score
(
t
,
n
) =
C
t
,
n
C
n
−
C
n
C
(5.1)
In other words, the score for an autotag t in neighborhood n is the percent of photos that have t
in that neighborhood, minus the percent of photos that have t
in the whole city.
We did this to
6

7
https://www.walkscore.com/methodology.shtml

penalize tags like “outdoor” and “indoor” that are common in all photos, while still retaining the
tags that are most common in each neighborhood. We used this instead of a TF-IDF based algo-
rithm because the autotags come from a closed vocabulary of about 1700 words, so the long tail
of natural language does not apply.
(Preliminary experiments with TF-IDF variants showed that
this was the case; TF-IDF tended to privilege common tags like “outdoor” because the number
of “outdoor” photos was so high, even when divided by the number of other neighborhoods that
have “outdoor” photos.)
For each neighborhood, we choose the ten autotags with the highest scores, and randomly select
five pictures from that neighborhood that have that autotag. We display the photos and the autotag
as shown in Figures 5.1 and 5.2.

OURSQUARE VENUES
Our participants described wanting to be in a lively place, where things were happening and there
were businesses and people around. While we cannot measure this exactly, we used the presence
of Foursquare venues as a reasonable proxy.
Foursquare venues are usually businesses such as
restaurants, bars, cafes, and shops (despite some occasional creative uses [53]), so a place with
more venues is likely to be more lively.
We used the Foursquare Venues API
8
to find all the venues in each city, then divided them into
neighborhoods.
We used the top-level venue categories to further divide venues into “Food”,
“Arts & Entertainment”,
“Nightlife Spot”,
“Outdoors & Recreation”,
and “Shop & Service”
venues.
The other top-level categories (“Travel & Transport”, “Residence”, “College & Univer-
sity”,
“Professional & Other Places”,
“Event”) were discarded,
either because they would not
add to liveliness of the area or because there were very few venues of that type.

WITTER COMMON WORDS
This section of the website is, by necessity, the most subjective. If participants want to “live like
locals,” we wanted to give them a way to see what locals talk, do, and think about. Twitter is not
a perfect sample of this, but it is one sample, and it’s free and publicly available, so we drew our
data for this section from it.
We had been storing coordinate-geotagged tweets from Pittsburgh since January 2014, San Fran-
cisco since June 2014,
and Houston and Chicago since November 2014.
Details of our data
collection are shown in Table 5.2.
At the time we built this tool, this meant we had between 2
and 3 years of all of the coordinate-geotagged tweets (tweets with a latitude-longitude point, as
in Chapter 3).
We began by removing all tweets from the accounts of known spammers, as job-
posting spammers had become a significant portion of our data (see Chapter 3 for more details).
Specifically,
we removed any account that contained “job”,
“career”,
“tmj”,
“join”,
“workat”,
“recruit”,
or “soliant”,
as those seemed the worst
offenders.
We split
each tweet
into tokens
using a python port
9
of the Twokenize tokenizer [62].
We then removed links,
@-references,
tokens that are all punctuation, and stopwords using the list provided in NLTK [9].
Finally, we
combined all words that remained in each neighborhood into an unordered bag of words.

Table 5.2:
Details of our Twitter data collection in the cities we used for our prototype.
For
each city,
we collected coordinate-geotagged tweets in a rectangle described by these latitude-
longitude coordinates.
Using these bags of words,
we calculated the score for each word in each neighborhood using
TF-IDF [78].
Specifically,
we define T FIDF
(
w
,
n
)
for word w in neighborhood n as follows:
Let C
w
,
n
be the number of times w appears in neighborhood n,
and let
N

be the number of
neighborhoods w appears in. Then:
T FIDF
(
w
,
n
) =
log

(5.2)
For each neighborhood, we identify the 10 words with the highest score, and present each word
along with 10 random tweets containing that word for context.
An example of how these are
displayed is shown in Figure 5.4.

LARIFICATION ON SPLITTING DATA INTO NEIGHBORHOODS
For all
of these dimensions besides Convenience,
we needed to split
many points into their
neighborhoods.
In order to do this, we used the Point-in-polygon implementation in the Python
Shapely library
10
.
However,
this algorithm is slow to use on millions of points and dozens of
polygons,
so we precomputed a grid of 0.001 degrees latitude/longitude across each city and
computed which neighborhood each point here is in.
Then, to find which neighborhood a given
crime/photo/tweet/venue is in, we rounded it to the nearest grid point and returned that answer.
This means we may have some points on a border between neighborhoods, up to 0.0005 degrees
away, categorized as the wrong neighborhood. Because 0.0005 degrees is about half a small city
block, we decided that was an acceptable inaccuracy.
The code used to generate this grid and find the neighborhood for points is available on Github
11
.

do this by a “similar neighborhood” system.
Using this, people could pick a neighborhood in a
city that they know, and see recommendations of cities in other neighborhoods.
We also chose
this path in order to diversify people’s choices:
perhaps one person might want a neighborhood
where they can go out and party,
while another person might want a quieter or more family-
friendly neighborhood.
To do this, we defined “dissimilarity” measures on each of the five dimensions of data we gath-
ered.
We do not claim these measures to be anything other than somewhat arbitrary initial at-
tempts.
They seem sensible and they work reasonably well.
In addition, there is no meaningful
ground truth; no canonical source of “The Williamsburg of Pittsburgh
12
,” so any attempt to opti-
mize these would be necessarily imprecise.
We defined dissimilarity of crime as one minus the ratio of crime rates in each neighborhood.
If
they have similar crime rates, their dissimilarity will be 1; if their crime rates are very different,
their dissimilarity will be 0. Formally, let Cr

We also used the neighborhood that
the user chose in order to show comparable statistics for the Safety, Convenience, and Liveliness
sections (See charts in Figure 5.2 and 5.3).
Our goal was to show the user not only the raw
numbers of crime rates, walk scores, and venue counts, but also to show the user some stats to
compare to: statistics for the city as a whole, statistics for the neighborhood they know well, and
statistics for the whole city they know well.

or near San Francisco. Participants were paid $15 for a session between 30-60 minutes in which
I would talk with them briefly about their travel experience,
describe the site,
and ask them to
use it to plan a hypothetical trip.
After that, I would ask them, among other questions, to order
the five parts of the site in usefulness.
Participants are described in Table 5.3.
This study was
approved by the Carnegie Mellon Institutional Review Board.
5.4.1
P
HOTOS ARE THE MOST USEFUL
; T
WEETS ARE THE LEAST
All users ranked the parts of the site, except for participant 9, who declined. We scored rankings
by giving 1 point to their most useful section,
up to 5 points for their least useful section.
If
they found two equivalently useful, we gave them both the average of the two scores. (That is, if
Photos and Venues were tied for first place, they would both get 1.5 points.) We then averaged
across all 9 participants, ending up with the ranking in Table 5.4.
Photos were almost universally preferred as the most useful information source. Participants C5
and C6 described that the photos gave them the best flavor or feel;
C7 described appreciating
them because they were unfiltered.
As she said,
“it’s easy to browse through and get
a feel
without having to read anything and get other people’s opinions.” Similarly, they have noticeable
practical uses: in the hypothetical trip planning, C1 and C3 were both saved from neighborhoods
that were more suburban and boring than they thought.
On the other hand,
tweets were seen to be the least useful.
C10 described how the words are
useless without context, and sometimes the context provided failed to even give him the necessary
context.
Crime data was seen as almost as useless, but its distribution is bimodal.
In interviews
in Chapter 4, some described crime data as being the most important to them, while others did
not care at all, and the same bimodal distribution held here. C6 thought crime data was the most

EIGHBORHOOD COMPARISON MAY BE TOO COMPLICATED AND SITUATIONAL
As described above, we used neighborhood comparison to help users navigate through the list of
neighborhoods. At the same time, I tried to ask participants if they would rather have simple “Top
5 neighborhoods” lists, such as “Top 5 Arts Neighborhoods” or “Top 5 Nightlife Neighborhoods”
instead of the similar neighborhoods. Four participants (C1, C4, C5, and C6) said yes, while two
(C8 and C10) said maybe. Nobody preferred the similar neighborhoods.
Neighborhood comparison may have failed for three reasons.
First,
confusion:
as C10 said,
“Similar to Mission” is tricky to interpret because there are so many things that could mean.
C6
brought up the related point of trust:
as soon as the algorithm “failed” (gave her a comparison
that she knew to be wrong) once,
she would stop trusting it.
Finally,
C1 brought up another
interesting objection: he travels to find something different, not something the same as home.
Regardless of reason,
the comparison between home neighborhoods and neighborhoods in the
target city proved less useful than we hoped.
Given its lack of utility,
we decided it would be
better to put
statistics on a colored chloropleth map,
rather than showing charts for statistics
separately.
5.4.3
D
ETAILS CAN COLOR USERS
’
EXPERIENCES
Photos serve users as tiny windows into other people’s lives, helping them to understand a deep
(though narrow) window. Sometimes users would fixate on this window and generalize that to the
whole area.
For example, C1 noticed a tweet about “elderberry syrup” in Northwest Pittsburgh
and thought that that would be an interesting area to explore.
Unfortunately, this was not from a
business that sold elderberry syrup; it was just someone at their home.
If he went there looking
for elderberry syrup,
he would probably be disappointed.
Similarly,
C10 saw some photos of
a hockey game in downtown Pittsburgh and fixated on hockey, thinking about that as the main
thing to do in Pittsburgh. Downtown Pittsburgh has hockey games, but there is certainly more to
55
the area! Even names can give people this kind of tunnel vision, as when C8 saw a neighborhood
called “Museum Park” in Houston and decided it
must
be stuffy and boring without
looking
through it thoroughly. This emphasized for us the importance of a diverse set of data so as not to
imply that something is more prevalent than it is.

ONCLUSION
In this chapter,
we describe our first Neighborhood Guides prototype and an initial user study
based on it.
We gained some valuable preliminary insights that will help us design the second
iteration. In addition, we learned that the primary data source that will help travelers learn about
neighborhoods is photos, which guided our next study.

When travelers are viewing data from cities remotely,
they have many data sources to choose
from.
Between tweets, venues, statistics, photos, and other data sources, it is intuitive that pho-
tos would be the most
helpful,
because they are the richest.
In addition,
recent
advances in
computer vision (like those described in [89]) are increasingly making it easy to sort,
process,
and otherwise use these photos.
In Chapter 5, initial reactions suggested that photos would be a
valuable part of any tool that used social media to help travelers, as well.
However,
which photos should we use? In the YFCC100M dataset alone,
there were roughly
900,000 photos from San Francisco, which translates to roughly 20,000 per neighborhood.
Fur-
thermore, there are more photo sources beyond Flickr.
Previous work has investigated ways to
summarize sets of geotagged data [4, 37, 42, 43], but are these methods ideal for summarizing
a place for travelers? Finally, is social media data the best data to describe a neighborhood, or
would users be better off with something like Google Street View photos that more accurately
shows the city from the street?
To answer these questions, we devised a Mechanical Turk experiment in which users could tell
us which data sources best represented their neighborhoods.
We tested six data sources:
three
from Flickr, two from Street View, and one from Instagram.
We gave them two pairs of photos
and asked participants to compare which photo set better represents their neighborhood,
then
aggregated to determine the overall best photo sets.

hood they had lived in or otherwise knew well. We then showed them the six photo sets described
in Section 6.1.1, two at a time, and asked them which one they thought better represented their
neighborhood. A screenshot is shown in Figure 6.1.
The survey took up to 5 minutes, and participants were paid $1.00. We recruited 200 participants
who had at least 1000 HITs accepted on Mechanical Turk and at least a 98% previous acceptance
rate. After inspecting their work, we found no reason to reject any workers.

Our main finding was that Street View photos were most often found to be the most representa-
tive.

Each of the Street View photo sets handily defeated all of the
social media photo sets.
In addition, we were surprised to see random Flickr photos performing
better than the photos selected according to [37].

Gate Park, Haight-Ashbury, Wrigleyville, and Downtown Houston), social media data sets did
outperform Street View.
We noticed that these were mostly rather iconic neighborhoods.
Chi-
natown is known for its unique decorations and excellent restaurants; Golden Gate Park is the
largest park in San Francisco, with many attractions; Haight-Ashbury has a storied history with
hippies and the 1967 Summer of Love; Wrigleyville is the home of Wrigley Field, the legendary
Chicago Cubs ballpark. The photo sets that users selected tended to emphasize the iconic nature
of these neighborhoods (e.g.
photos of Chinese food in Chinatown;
photos of the stadium in
Wrigleyville), while Street View photos showed humdrum streets.
See Figures 6.2 and 6.3 for
examples of why Chinatown was better reflected in its Instagram photos.

LICKR DATA
Because the Flickr photos from the YFCC100M dataset have autotags attached that reflect their
content,
we can analyze this content.
We selected the “winner” Flickr photo sets,
defined as
those that won at least 75% of their comparisons, and compared their autotags to the autotags of
all photo sets, looking for tags that appear much more or less often in the “winner” photo sets.
Results are shown in Table 6.3.
It appears that tags relating to the built environment were more
prevalent in the “winner” photo sets, while tags about nature were less prevalent.

There may be a disparity that we didn’t anticipate between users who have lived in a place and
users who know a place well.
The 7 participants who selected “Golden Gate Park,” which has
no housing, suggests that a substantial number of people selected neighborhoods that they knew
well, rather than neighborhoods that they lived in.
In addition, Wrigleyville and Chinatown are
not large neighborhoods, so we would be surprised if many people lived there.

Frequency difference is the percent of photos that had this tag in the “winner” photo sets minus

cates that this tag appears in very representative photos, while low frequency difference indicates
that this tag does not appear often in very representative photos.

Most of these reflect boring-looking buildings, because the most interesting parts of
Chinatown are inside these buildings.
63
If we assume that these users were visitors,
it may suggest an explanation of why their results
were different than the majority.
When they went to Wrigleyville, they may have seen the base-
ball stadium, so people’s photos within the stadium seem “more representative” than photos of
the street outside. People who live in Wrigleyville may think the opposite.
This also highlights the distinction between photos that are representative and photos that are
useful. When travelers are going to a new city, they may not want to have a perfect representation
of that city. This brings us back to the “ideal everyday” idea from Chapter 4.5.4. These travelers
want to understand a slice of everyday life, but not the boring parts of everyday life.
They don’t
particularly want to go to an office hour 8 hours, or renew their driver’s license at the DMV. They
want to see what part of everyday life is there that is not everywhere else.
Locals,
on the other hand,
may have enough experience there to see things more realistically.
They may see the photos from the street
as the “real” city,
while the attractions are only the
“tourist” city.

ANDOM IS

One side finding that intrigued us was the fact that the model from Jaffe et al [37] did not outper-
form random Flickr photos, and the S
TREET

IEW
V

model did not strongly outperform
random Street View photos.
This may be another side effect of asking about what is “most rep-
resentative” instead of what photos are most individually useful.
It may also be the case that it
matters less what the content of each individual photo is and more that there simply are some
photos.
While this study did not give us the result we expected, it gave us an interesting avenue to explore.
Perhaps we should include street view photos in our neighborhood guides, or perhaps we worded
this study poorly and ended up investigating something other than we wanted.
The findings that
more iconic neighborhoods being reflected better in social media reflects the latter, but our final
study will hopefully elucidate this point.
6.3.3
T
HE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE THAN NATURE
Our findings in Table 6.3 suggest that tags like
Building
and
Architecture
appeared more
often in photo sets that were selected as winners, while tags like
Nature
and
Plant
appeared
less often. This makes sense when one considers that built environment has more variance; nature
probably looks similar throughout a city, while buildings can vary widely.
Another interesting finding is that both
Outdoor
and
Indoor
tags, two of the most common
tags throughout the YFCC100M data set, are found less often in “winning” photo sets.
Perhaps
this reflects that photos are more representative if it’s hard to tell whether they are indoors or
outdoors.
The lack of an
indoor
or
outdoor
tag may also mean that there is some action or
movement in the photo that makes the exact location harder to determine. Further study into the
system tagging these photos would be helpful to understand what these findings mean.

After the initial evaluation of the Neighborhood Guides,

In this section,

the study I ran and the insights learned from it.
I found that
social
media photos show the idealized side of the city that creative tourists want to see, that the best

that people search for textual “blurbs” to give them a schema to base their understanding of the

After the feedback from the initial evaluation in section 5.4, we made some changes to the Neigh-

HIDE TWEETS AND SIMILAR NEIGHBORHOODS
This change was relatively straightforward,
given our results in section 5.4.1.
Photos seemed
the most immediately useful data source for travelers,
and tweets were the least useful,
so we
reoriented our site to focus more on photos and we hid the tweets.
The new site would only
include the map and photos.
In the user study we did with Neighborhood Guides 2.0,
tweets
were hidden to start. (We did retain the option to show them via a small control at the bottom of
the page, for our use in the user study.)
We showed the Street
View photos first,
after the results of our study in Chapter 6,
and also
included random Flickr photos with one per photographer (corresponding to the F

NSTAGRAM
) condition, which started hid-
den but could be shown during the study.
We hid the Twitter common words,
but likewise maintained the control that let us show them
during the study.
Of course,
our results from the initial study in Chapter 5 do not prove that
there is no useful way to use geotagged tweets to describe an area. Our sample size was only 10
people, and even if we had a larger sample that said the same thing, that would only prove that
our method of selecting tweets did not describe an area well.
Regardless, we chose primarily to
use photos in order to focus our attention.

7.1.2
C
OMBINE MAP AND STATISTICS
Participants in our first study had some difficulty understanding statistics like Walk Score, crime
rates, and venue densities when they were separated from the map.
We had chosen to separate
them in order to allow users to compare statistics between their familiar neighborhood and a
new one, but we understood this was less useful than allowing them to quickly compare across
neighborhoods in the same city. As a result, we hid the charts comparing each dimension to their
home dimension,
and added a chloropleth layer on top of the map to let people explore many
dimensions quickly.
The lack of comparison charts weakened the “similar neighborhoods” feature, so we hid that too.
This also helped remove some of the noise from the site, as more people found it confusing than
helpful.
Similarly to the other features, though, we maintained the ability to show it if it would
help our conversation.

ETHODS
We ran this user study as an extended version of the user study in chapter 5.
We would talk
with the participants a bit about a recent trip, then ask them to plan a hypothetical trip to one of
the cities in our site that they had not yet been to.
(Only one participant, D4, had been to all of
these cities; we asked him to choose the city he was least familiar with.)
I asked 19 of the 21
participants (the other two ran out of time) about their preferences of photo subsets by turning
on and off each photo set. If it came up in conversation and if time permitted, I would also show
them the “Similar Neighborhoods” feature and ask them whether they would prefer that or a
“Top 5 Arts/Nightlife/etc neighborhood” feature.
We recruited participants through social
media and via the CMU Center for Behavioral
and
Decision Research Participant Pool. Participant demographics are shown in Table 7.1.
Interviews lasted up to 60 minutes, and participants were paid $15.
Sessions were conducted in
the cafe in the Gates-Hillman Center of Carnegie Mellon University.
Because this was a public
place,
we could not record the interviews; instead,
we took notes as the study progressed,
and
condensed them to the 2-7 most interesting findings after each session (or after a block of ses-
sions, if there were a few in a row).
These notes were then analyzed using affinity diagramming
(as described in [8]) to identify common themes.

nations.
Most of them involved a variant of the idea that they don’t actually want to see how a
place really looks, they want to see something exciting about the place.
D21 described wanting
“to capture where people see beauty”; D1 described it as seeing “the best side of each neighbor-
hood.” Others described the Street View photos as boring (D7) or “too zoomed-in” (D6). D3, D4,
and D12 appreciated the Flickr photos with autotag-based categories, as they help them process
all these photos so quickly.
7.3.2
T
HE IDEAL PHOTO HAS A PERSON
,
DOING A THING
Many participants talked about wanting to learn not only what a place looks like, but also what
people do there.
If a photo just has a person’s face, that’s useless - D7 reported wanting to see
people doing things, “not just a picture of a guy.” D21 also described how finding activities she
could do in the place would be helpful.
On the other hand,
if a photo just has pictures of the
place, that is likewise unhelpful; D3 and D12 described that being a shortcoming of the Street
View photos.
On the other hand, people participating in one-time events can be both positive and negative. D1
and D18 enjoyed learning about local events, but D8 and D10 noted that they are only helpful
to travelers if the travelers happen to be in town when the event is happening.
These events are
often causes for taking lots of photos, too, which means that they may become the majority of
the photos in a region. Therefore, when selecting photos from a neighborhood, half of the photos
might come from something that happens only once a year. This was the case for D8, who found
a lot of photos from the Washington Ave Coalition/Memorial Park neighborhood of Houston to
be from a running event. She learned little about the neighborhood besides that it had some kind
of race once a year.
7.3.3
A “
BLURB
”
GIVES PEOPLE A CONCEPTUAL START
When researching a new neighborhood, participants struggled with trying to make sense of a lot
of disparate information. Seeing statistics on a map showed them one side of a neighborhood, but
it was impossible to keep them all in their mind; similarly, the photos showed a lot of different
stories from different people.
They wanted to be able to tell one cohesive narrative about the
neighborhood; whatever it was that all these photos and statistics had in common. Of course, any
71
one narrative would naturally collapse a lot of the neighborhood’s natural complexity,
but that
was fine; it would give them some way to organize all this information in their mind.
D10 described how the Neighborhood Guides site “does a lot at a glance;
I kinda want to get
the editorialized version.”
He described how he would read books,
local blogs (like “I Heart
Reykjavik
1
” when traveling to Iceland), books, or TV shows set in an area before traveling there.
He used Wikitravel
2
, an online travel guide, to see a factual overview of what’s in a place; beyond
that, he wanted some description.
Different travelers had different ways to find such a blurb.
D15 used the Airbnb neighborhood
guide’s one-sentence overviews, like “Mexican bakeries, Chinese take out spots, artisanal donut
shops,
ramen restaurants,
and lively bars all near Dolores Park.
3
” D2 and D20 both Googled
the neighborhood they were looking at (Hayes Valley, San Francisco, and Montrose, Houston),
settling a local newspaper’s page
4
and a tourism bureau site
5
. When asked, neither could describe
exactly what they were looking for,
but they seemed satisfied with those two sites,
seemingly
because they gave them a fuller picture than a few snapshots.
Lacking even a short
blurb,
some participants would go so far as to build their own picture,
based on a neighborhood’s name.
This is not necessarily a mistake; for example, D13 described
an attraction to the Marina neighborhood in San Francisco because she likes being by the water,
and D6 saw Museum Park in Houston and rightly assumed it was where all the museums are.
However, it can lead travelers astray, as when D15 saw “Russian Hill” and assumed it must be a
heavily Russian area (it’s not particularly). More unfortunately, it usually does not give travelers
much help, because most neighborhood names are uninformative.
7.3.4
S
TATISTICS ARE OCCASIONALLY USEFUL
Participants used the map and statistics, but not thoroughly. They would sometimes click through
the different maps to get a sense of where anything was, like D2 checking the “All Venues” or
D6 trying to avoid “residential” places because there was not as much to do.
They would also
occasionally use the statistics to avoid high-crime areas, like D20 being intrigued by Midtown but
ruling it out after learning of its high crime rate. In these ways, they functioned as simple search
tools, directing travelers not to one particular neighborhood but rather to a set of neighborhoods
that were at least reasonably dense.

7.4.1
P
LANNING TRAVEL IS ABOUT GETTING EXCITED AND AVOIDING TRAPS
Clawson and Knetsch, in 1966, described anticipation as the first part of an outdoor recreation
experience.
As they wrote, “a fisherman may get more enjoyment from tieing his own dry flies
through the winter than he will lager get from the actual fishing itself” [12]. This principle rings
true in our participants’ stories and plans, and can explain many of our findings. A photo showing
someone doing an activity would inspire much more anticipation than one simply showing a
building or a person;
the benefit of the photos is that they can mentally bring people into that
activity.
This would also explain some of our other findings. Picture quality and page polish matters (D4
skipped over some sections because they had missing photos;
D9 selected as her most useful
photo set the one that had the aesthetically best photos). If participants were trying to understand
some “true” perception of the city, the photo quality would not matter. But if they are trying to get
excited about the area, of course they want to see the most beautiful side of each neighborhood.
(Incidentally, this factor may also help explain why Street View photos did better in the study in
Chapter 6.
They are all the same size, so we could display them in a neat grid, while the social
media photos could not be so neatly arranged.)
In addition, the short “blurb” that the participants sought out makes more sense if their goal was
to find an exciting part of a city than if they were trying to find an accurate view. No short blurb
can explain, for example, all of the history, culture, problems, and triumphs of San Francisco’s
Mission District, but a blurb can quickly point readers to its “Mexican bakeries, Chinese take out
spots, ... and lively bars near Dolores Park.”
There is another side to the trip-planning process,
however:
the necessity of avoiding traps.
There are a number of kinds of traps, including unusually high-crime areas, surprisingly spread-
out residential neighborhoods, or quintessential tourist traps. This is why D13 talked about being
interested in “authenticity;” despite not being able to define it exactly,
she knew that “staged”
photos from tourist attractions might lead her into a trap. This is also why D19 and D20 changed
their plans from their first inclinations (The Tenderloin in San Francisco and Midtown in Hous-
ton); the neighborhoods looked interesting, but they realized they might end up in a higher-crime
situation than they expected.
Thus,
travelers must
manage this tension of building excitement
while avoiding traps.
First
person accounts and photos build excitement;
by reading individual stories,
photos,
and blog
posts, a traveler can see all the compelling scenarios that might play out when they travel there.
However, it is much easier to find what not to do by taking a wider, calmer, birds-eye view like
that offered by statistics.
In the rest of this chapter, we will explain how these two components
can do their jobs optimally.
7.4.2
S
OCIAL MEDIA PHOTOS CAN HELP TRAVELERS GET EXCITED
The role social media photos can play for travelers involves building their anticipation about a
place. This is why they were the best choices when we asked “what photos are most useful when
you’re traveling?”, while the Street View photos were ranked higher in Chapter 6 when we asked
“which photos best represent your neighborhood?” Our participants liked seeing people doing
73
things, they liked seeing a diverse array of photos, and they liked seeing the most beautiful and
well-shot photos in each neighborhood.
The question of which photos should be shown is still an open question. We did not find evidence
to support the algorithm of [37], but we did not find any other photo set that was consistently more
effective either. We did, however, uncover a lot of pitfalls. Low-quality, low-resolution, or badly-
lit photos should be removed. Photos from the same photographer should be limited, and possibly
photos from the same day as well; photos are more useful to travelers when they represent a wide
and diverse cross-section of the experiences in the area. Some kind of organization seems useful,
where our autotag-based categorization is one possible option.
Finally, there is plenty of room to explore when selecting and displaying photos.
Some partici-
pants speculated about creative ideas like only selecting the photos with text in them (perhaps to
show how signs or publications varied from place to place) or to sort photos by focal length to
avoid short-range selfies or long-range skyline shots.
We encourage future work in this space to
investigate new ideas, as long as they promote a diverse array of photos from the neighborhood.
7.4.3
S
TATISTICS CAN HELP TRAVELERS AVOID TRAPS
Statistics still play an important role in helping travelers, but it is a niche role.
We improved the
Neighborhood Guides site between versions 1.0 and 2.0 by removing a lot of the screen real estate
dedicated to numbers,
but we did not go far enough.
Our statistics could be further simplified
because they are mostly just proxies for residential density: higher downtown, lower in outlying
neighborhoods. Clearly the venue densities are this way; Walk Scores tend to follow this pattern
too, because it’s easier to walk, bike, or take transit when everything is closer together.
Crime
per capita is not always higher downtown, but it often is; D5 explicitly mentioned that when he
saw high crime in the Loop of Chicago.
As he said, he wasn’t worried about crime downtown
because he knows it happens.
Similarly,
our removal of comparisons to a user’s home neighborhood mattered only in a few
edge cases.
D10, for example, described how he might want comparisons to his home city only
if he’s dealing with a particularly high crime region. Despite knowing that a place is the highest-
crime neighborhood around, if it is still safer than places he knew, he would not mind.
Therefore, we could replace all of the chloropleth maps with a simple map that showed residential
density.
This would answer the most
common question people used the map for:
“where is
everything?” This would easily help them avoid the pitfall of booking a place that happens to be
in an inaccessible or boring neighborhood, while not overwhelming them with numbers. Perhaps
a crime map could be included too; as in the study in Chapter 5, it’s something that most people
don’t care about, but a few people cannot live without.
More investigation should be done into what traps travelers see, and how they can be avoided, in
order to maximize the usefulness of maps and statistics. Regardless, it seems clear that statistics
should be in a supporting role, with photos and other personal accounts featured in order to build
travelers’ excitement.

C
ONCLUSION
In this chapter, we described the results of an investigation into travel planning when users ac-
tually have social media and other data in front of them.
We found that there is a role for social
media to play,
but it isn’t as straightforward as finding the right information to accurately de-
scribe the area.
Social media should be used to build travelers’ excitement and anticipation for
the trip they’re about to take by reflecting the diversity of life and experience that exists in that
area.
Statistics and other data sources can be used as well, to help travelers avoid traps.
In the

ORK
In these studies, we set out to answer the following questions:
•
What do creative tourists mean by “getting a feel for the city”?
•
Can social media help them achieve this goal?
•
What can social media tell us about our cities and neighborhoods?
Chapter 4 provides our answer to the first question: they want to maximize along five dimensions
of safety, convenience, aesthetic appeal, liveliness, and the ability to live like locals. Chapters 3,
5, 6, and 7 address the second two questions. In this chapter, we will first revisit the first question,
then tie together the results from all of these studies to more clearly discuss what we have learned
with relation to the second two.
Meanwhile, we will then discuss what these findings mean for
future researchers and developers.

REATIVE TOURISTS
’
PREFERENCES
In Chapter 4,
we gained an overview of the dimensions that are important to modern creative
tourists:
safety, convenience, aesthetic appeal, liveliness, and the ability to live like locals.
On-
going studies helped us learn a bit more about these dimensions and include bits that these di-
mensions may leave out.
First of all, diversity was mentioned a lot, whether it was C2 describing how all the photos only
reflected one “place” of the neighborhood or D1, D19, and D20 explicitly looking for a diverse
set of photos.
We saw this in our initial study in Chapter 4 too, considering “diversity” one of
our potential dimensions, until the survey showed people didn’t view it as a separate construct.
Perhaps the disconnect
happened because survey respondents saw the word “diversity” only
to mean racial
diversity.
Interviewees talked about
diversity of people,
but
also diversity of
actions; they wanted to see the breadth of possible things they could do there.
See Figure 8.1;
a place with all young rich white people,
say,
but lots of things to do is not ideal,
as it is seen
as homogenous.
But a diverse suburban neighborhood would also not be ideal because there is
nothing for travelers to do there; this would be the “Residential” quadrant.
The ideal location
would have both a variety of people and a variety of things to do there.
Another dimension that was not fully included in our model, but that kept being mentioned, was
uniqueness. People travel to find “something different, not something the same” (C1). This may
have been the reason that neighborhood comparison was not a well-liked way to navigate.
We
had focused on finding things that were unique within a city, like using Twitter to find words that
were popular in one neighborhood but not popular in other neighborhoods.
However,
a better
model might be to find words that are unique between cities,
then find where those words are
found within cities.
Pierogies are more popular in Pittsburgh than in most cities,
so finding a

Third,
“authenticity” came up in reports from participants like D13 and D20.
Participant D20
gave the most succinct definition of “authenticity”: something is authentic if it is run for locals,
not just to take tourists’ money. This may be a valid, limited way to consider authenticity without
solving the entire, complex question of authenticity as put forth by authors like MacCannell [56]
and Wang [95].
We could create a new term, “Weak” Authenticity, which is satisfied as long as
one simply avoids cynical tourist traps.
MacCannell argued that tourists always want to get further backstage, but our research suggests
that that is slightly oversimplified.
Certainly, participants want to avoid some of the most egre-
gious front
stage places,
like D13 talking about
“staged” photos at
tourist
attractions or D21
avoiding “gimmicky, touristy” sights.
However, sometimes participants like C6 and B7 wanted
to be more central (and therefore in a more front stage place) due to language difficulties.
They
were interested in the daily life of people around where they were traveling,
but because they
were not
fluent
in Czech and Spanish,
respectively,
they had to stick to more front
stage lo-
cations.
(Undoubtedly this would be a wider concern if we had focused more on international
travelers.) We can therefore see authenticity as a tension between competing factors: participants
want to see more of the backstage of a place,
but they are often limited by practical concerns.
MacCannell acknowledged this as well, but in our research, we found the practical concerns usu-
ally outweighing this search for the “most authentic” places. As a result, our new term of “Weak
Authenticity”, which is limited to merely avoiding the worst, most inauthentic places, becomes
a better criterion in our model than stronger, more complicated versions of authenticity.
77
8.1.1
E
NRICHING THE MODEL WITH
“T
RAPS
”
Tourist traps are one class of trap that a traveler might run into. A wider definition of “traps” may
be a useful way to refine the model, as it would take into account the way people want to know
about our five dimensions. The dimensions are not all equally weighted, nor are they understood
linearly.
Safety and convenience, in particular, should be seen not as linear attributes, but rather
as thresholds or gates. For most participants, if a place was within their comfort zone, they didn’t
give the safety of it a second thought.
If it was “dangerous,” though, the area was immediately
ruled out.
Similarly, a place doesn’t have to be as connected as Times Square; it just has to be
accessible enough based on where they want to go and their modes of transportation.
Instead
of five dimensions participants are trying to maximize, there may be a few thresholds and a few
positive aspects.
See Figure 8.2 for a potential third iteration of this model,
showing the three
thresholds and four positive aspects of neighborhood search.
Of course,
more research is needed to further develop the model of creative tourist needs and
confirm our new model.
The way to integrate the dimensions of diversity and uniqueness into
our model is an open question.
Tourism researchers, too, should further define what constitutes
a “creative” tourist, as opposed to a “cultural” or “sun and sand” tourist. Furthermore, these def-
initions should include some concept of tourists being multiple types; few people are singularly
one type or another.
Even within the same trip, someone may spend one day seeing the sights
and the next day trying to blend in as a local.
8.2
H
OW SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER DATA CAN HELP THESE TOURISTS
With these updated preferences in mind, we return to the application question: how can we build
something to help tourists learn what they need to know? Based on our studies, we would provide
the following recommendations for future tourist guide developers.
8.2.1
P
RIOR WORK AND IMPROVEMENTS
Others have researched ways to help tourists learn about cities they visit. As described in Chapter
2, many of these have focused on building recommendation systems (e.g.
[49, 84]), which does
not adequately address the human needs involved in tourism.
In addition,
tools like Yelp and
TripAdvisor help people learn about
what
businesses exist
in a given place,
but
they are too
mechanical to give tourists a thorough picture. These sites focus on the space, while the work in
this document aims to give users a sense of the place [30].
Projects like Curated City [17] and Where is the Soho of Rome [51] try to give people a sense
of the place through different means.
Curated City lets people contribute what they love about
different neighborhoods; however, I avoid the substantial bootstrapping problem of such a system
by using data that
people are already posting.
Neighborhood comparison as in [51] gives a
qualitative sense of neighborhoods by comparing them to others, but the output is not very rich.
Neighborhood Guides can be thought of as a browsing tool, a way for readers to get a rich image
of a neighborhood and interact with data in different forms.
Having built such a tool,
I will spend the rest of this chapter providing recommendations for
others building similar tools.

S
IMPLIFY MAPS
,
ADD SURPRISE
,
AND INTEGRATE MORE DATA
A map remains an important navigation point.
It is the quickest, easiest way to understand the
basic layout of a city. Given that tourists have to get around an unfamiliar place, it is critical that
they have at least a rough idea of where these places are.
In addition,
when we overlaid data
on top of the map, participants understood it much more quickly and easily.
As we discussed in
Chapter 7, most statistics are simply proxies for residential density, so we could replace most of
our map with a density map, adding a crime map if needed.
Correll and Heer [13] have noticed a similar problem on large maps, like maps of US counties
or Canadian provinces:
most maps of these areas are simply population density maps.
Even
maps that are corrected for population density (by using per-capita statistics instead of absolute
statistics) fail because they instead highlight sparsely populated areas with large relative (and
mostly random) fluctuations.
They describe a Bayesian algorithm used to generate “Surprise
Maps” that show how surprising an area is.
This would fit perfectly with our needs:
instead of
showing crime rates,
for example,
the map could show only areas that have surprisingly high
crime, helping visitors avoid that area.
More obviously, it would be helpful to integrate chloropleth maps with other data sources. Many
times during our studies,
participants would say something like,
“this area looks interesting.
What hotels are there?” We would have no way to answer them.
Integrating sites like Book-
ing.com, Airbnb, and Yelp would help people find not only what areas they like, but also what
specific things in those areas.
Some of these maps could be quite detailed;
as D15 said,
she
didn’t want an area that just has “shopping” as much as one that has a specific kind of shopping.
Even more useful functionality would enable users to save some spots while looking at a map,
so they can pick out the sights they want to see or other personally-relevant venues, then see how
accessible those places are from a number of potential neighborhoods.
8.2.3
S
ELECT THE BEST PHOTOS
Photos remain our most useful single data source, as each one can convey a lot more informa-
tion, and trigger more imagination, than simple words can.
However, we learned many ways to
improve the information that people can glean from a set of photos.
This involves selecting the
right photos and presenting them in the right way.
There are many ways to select the “right” photos to describe an area. We reimplemented one, the
algorithm in [37], but did not find that it was significantly more useful to our participants than
random photos.
We chose this method over other approaches, because they were all somewhat
unsuitable for our particular task.
For example,
Crandall et al [15] selected a “representative”
image for each city and each landmark,
but
we wanted more than one photo so users could
explore an area themselves.
Other approaches looked to first
understand the “representative
tags” for an area [4,
43,
64,
73],
but
as our tags came from a closed vocabulary based on a
computer vision system, the same approach may not apply.
Some, like [43], went on to suggest
representative images based on these tags,
but these were often based on images of the same
landmark; “representativeness” for them means it’s a valid picture of that landmark, while for us
it means it shows life in the neighborhood well.
80
Our work, however, suggests that automatizing the process too much can have its own pitfalls.
First,
it
can focus too much on one side of the city,
as when it
only showed runners or only
showed white and Asian people. Second, an issue of trust appears: can users trust that the photos
are a fair representation of a place if a complex algorithm is selecting them?
As a result,
we
believe that the best way forward is to apply a few simple algorithmic filters to weed out “bad”
photos, then to randomly select from what remains.
Some of these filters could be based on the autotags Flickr provides.
First, remove photos that
only have faces, or those that only have buildings.
Other heuristics could be developed as well,
like only selecting photos with at least some people in them, or only taking outdoor photos. Non-
autotag-based heuristics should apply as well,
like taking photos from multiple photographers
and multiple days, so that the entire photo set is not one viewpoint or one event.
Finally, some
notion of image quality should be included, too; perhaps if the photo is too bright, dark, or blurry,
leave it out.
In summary, we suggest the following heuristics for picking photos that will be helpful for trav-
elers:
1.
Select photos of people doing things.
2.
Do not select too many photos from the same person.
3.
Do not select too many photos from the same day.
4.
Select photos with good overall quality (lighting, sharpness).
5.
Sort photos somehow, so they are not overwhelming.
8.2.4
U
SE MORE FORMS OF STRUCTURED TEXT
While text did not play a large role in our studies, we still think that it would be useful, due to
participants’ propensity to look for short descriptions of neighborhoods.
We would adjust from
our approach, though, in a few ways.
First,
while tweets are rich sources of data,
their free-text
nature means that
it
is difficult
to
identify key words. A lot of the terms we identified in 5 were venue names; this is not inherently
problematic, but can be frustrating if one wanted to learn about other important things besides
venues.
One way to remedy this might be to select terms from a closed vocabulary.
As a test,
we ran a simple experiment
to find each city’s favorite foods on Twitter.
We used a closed
vocabulary of about 500 names of foods
1
, and assigned each one a score for each city based on
simple version of the TF-iDF algorithm. In this case, term frequency was defined as the number
of times the term appeared in this city,
and document
frequency was the number of times it
appeared in all cities.
Results, shown in Table 8.1, seem at a glance to match up with common
knowledge about each place. The question “what foods should I try when I’m in a certain city?”
is often on travelers’ minds,
and by constraining our tweets to answer this question instead of
the broader question of “what’s popular here?”,
we are able to give people some more useful
information.

they can also be interpreted as “56% of the mentions of pecans were in Austin.” No-
tice the occurrence of iconic and regional foods,

Francisco, and lox in New York.
Second, we would aim to include more different types of textual data to answer different types
of questions.
One example we could use would be things that can be done in an area.
Dearman
et al [20, 21] have developed ways, based on verb-noun pairs in Yelp reviews, to determine what
can be done in an area.
Third, we would ideally include some version of the “blurb” that we described in Chapter 7:
a
sentence-length or paragraph-length description of an area. This would eliminate tourists’ needs
to search for other websites to provide a conceptual overview of a neighborhood. Unfortunately,
no obvious source exists for this type of data. For one way to create it, we look to crowdsourcing;
projects like Curated City [17] suggest that people enjoy talking about what they love about their
neighborhood, and may be willing to contribute short descriptions of it.
8.2.5
O
VERALL INTEGRATION
Using a customer journey map (see Figure 8.3),
we can track a person’s path through using
this tool to get useful insights about the neighborhoods in a city they’re traveling to.
In doing
so,
we realize that the guide-booking process is a two way street:
users do not simply find a
neighborhood and stick with it.
Instead,
they may go back and forth between guides and sites
that tell them where they can book.
This can be a particular pain point, if they find an area they
like, but can’t find a place to stay there.
As a result, it would be ideal to integrate this tool with
sites like booking.com, hotels.com, and Airbnb to help users decide where to stay without any
task-switching.
Another potential opportunity is a higher-level city guide, to show the best parts of the whole city,
not just each neighborhood.
This would then be useful for a trip that’s less structured than the
one in Figure 8.3, in which the traveler does not already know their destination.
They may find
that the entire feel of Pittsburgh is appealing to them, or that they might prefer to visit another
city. This is particularly relevant in international travel, where culture can differ widely between
cities and countries.
Finally, a third opportunity appears once a user arrives at their destination. In addition to showing

W
HAT SOCIAL MEDIA REVEALS ABOUT OUR CITIES
The question of what public geotagged social media reveals about our cities may be of broader
interest to the research community. Many researchers have attempted to use social media to find
out factual information. For example, the LiveHoods project used Foursquare check-ins to better
understand neighborhoods that reflect social movement within a city [18], and Kafsi et al used
Flickr to find tags that are particularly representative of a region [42].
Most of these applications bottom-up or data-driven. The work by Kafsi et al, for example, starts
from Flickr data and shows what that data can tell us about the city. Similarly, LiveHoods reveals
what Foursquare can tell us about a city.
In this document, I expand on their work, but also connect them to a top-down need: that of the
tourist.
In doing so, I also help to understand the possible application space.
Instead of simply
finding out one more thing from the data,
I show clues where social media data is useful and
where it is not. Particularly, social media data is useful to tell us about the best side of a city, and
unhelpful to tell us about quantitative demographics or other more objective information.
83
8.3.1
W
HY NOT TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA QUANTITATIVELY
Geotagged social media is an inherently biased data source because it depends on its user base,
which is a small subset of people.
Researchers constantly note this, but then often brush it aside
or ignore it, because there is no easy way to correct for it.
Sometimes these studies attempt to do something quite precise, like find where users live.
Be-
cause of the noise in social media data,
it is hard to be very precise;
results include locating
49.9% of people within 100 miles [31] or 79.9% of people within 200 miles [77].
Other times,
they take a broader look at mobility and find patterns like Levy flights in people’s movement [7],
which is useful in the aggregate but can be difficult to apply to any one individual situation.
Furthermore, the data stream is drying up. As we showed in Chapter 3, the volume of geotagged
tweets at the sub-city level is shrinking,
and data sources like Instagram are shutting off their
public APIs.
Anything that
attempts to find something quantitative will
likely lead to other
researchers building on top of it, which is problematic if it’s based on a small and shifting data
source.
8.3.2
W
HAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAN TELL US
However,
we have shown that
public geotagged social
media data does display a useful
side
of each neighborhood and city.
It
can be used to show people around a neighborhood,
and
furthermore to show not just the factual buildings-and-roads view of a neighborhood,
but also
the subjective “best
side” of that
neighborhood.
Social
media posts can show travelers what
people do locally, what they like, and what they think is worth recording. Based on our research,
we suggest the following principles when trying to interpret geotagged social media data:
•
Remember that this data is from a small sample of people.
•
Remember that this data is probably consciously geotagged.
•
Use the data in such a way that a human can interpret it (i.e. the output should be something
for a human to browse, not a number).
•
Use it to spark ideation, not confirmation.
If you generate a hypothesis from this kind of
data, confirm it with more substantial data.
•
Do not
use it
for anything mission-critical.
Realize that
Twitter,
Instagram,
and other
platform owners can remove it at any time.
Keeping these principles in mind will ensure that the application gains the benefits of the diversity
and richness of public geotagged social media data, while not falling prey to many of its pitfalls.

C
ONCLUSION
Travelers are not like they used to be.
In the past, tourism sites could put up a list of sites and
consider their work finished. Now, though, a new breed of tourists are more demanding: creative
tourists want to get out and explore different parts of the city and learn what some of the everyday
life around there is like.
What does this mean, though; what do these tourists really want? And
how can they find it?
At the same time, we are now over a decade past the introduction of Twitter, Flickr, and Face-
book,
so we have had plenty of time for users to create and share public geotagged data.
The
question remains, what can we do with that data?
In this thesis,
we have addressed these three questions.
Through a series of interviews and
surveys, we developed an initial answer to the first question, what creative tourists really want.
We’ve found that they want a place that is safe, convenient, lively, and aesthetically pleasing, and
that allows them to live like locals wherever they are.
We further refined this model to suggest
the inclusion of diversity,
authenticity,
and uniqueness,
but further research is needed to refine
this revised model.
We have developed a series of answers to the question of how travelers can get the information
they need as well, through a series of prototype-based user studies and a quantitative Mechanical
Turk study. These led us to the conclusions that there is room for a neighborhood guide applica-
tion that would help them learn about neighborhoods, and that social media photos are the most
useful data source to help them get there.
Finally,
we have added to the literature about
what
social
media can tell
us about
our cities.
We provide evidence that social media, instead of being a quantitative data source like the U.S.
Census, is best understood as a qualitative data source that people can use to explore new places.
We hope to encourage further research in this vein, and further applications that use the richness
of social media to aid exploration.
We hope that this encourages more research on social media and more tools for travelers that
meet modern travelers’ needs. Tourism can be a way for people to relax and have fun, but also a
powerful force for helping people understand different people and different cultures, especially
in the age of shared lodging sites like Airbnb and Couchsurfing.
We hope that the abundance of
social media makes this cultural exchange more feasible.
