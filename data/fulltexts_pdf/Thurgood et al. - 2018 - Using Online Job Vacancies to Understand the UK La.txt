Abstract
What type of disaggregation should be used to analyse heterogeneous labour markets? How granular 
should that disaggregation be? Economic theory does not currently tell us; perhaps data can. Analyses 
typically split labour markets according to top-down classification schema such as sector or occupation. 
But these may be slow-moving or inaccurate relative to the structure of the labour market as perceived by 
firms and workers. Using a dataset of 15 million job adverts posted online between 2008 and 2016, we 
create an empirically driven, ‘bottom-up’ segmentation of the labour market which cuts across wage, 
sector, and occupation. Our segmentation is based upon applying machine learning techniques to the 
demand expressed in the text of job descriptions. This segmentation automatically identifies traditional 
job roles but also surfaces sub-markets not apparent in current classifications. We show that the 
segmentation has explanatory power for offered wages. The methodology developed could be deployed to 
create data-driven taxonomies in conditions of rapidly changing labour markets and demonstrates the 
potential of unsupervised machine learning in economics.
Key words: Vacancies, classification, disaggregation.

Introduction
Large, naturally occurring datasets present big opportunities for understanding the economy in new levels
of detail.
They can complement more traditional data sources, such as the surveys often used in economics.
These data,
which may be captured in the course of using a phone or a website for another purpose,
can
be cheaper, more granular, and on scales in excess of what is practical for a survey.
One way that they can help is by giving new perspectives on how markets are organised.
When
economists and statisticians assess the labour market in detail,
looking at the demand for workers of
specific types,
they use schema such as occupation or sector.
These classifications help to make sense of
the millions of jobs in the economy by putting them into similar buckets.
They are carefully designed by
statisticians.
Because these schema are fixed for many years at a time, they allow for analysis with a time
dimension.
However, there is a cost to this; it ignores changes in the ‘true’ set of jobs in the economy.
Demand for
new jobs may emerge, and older jobs become less important.
So, alongside fixed schema, it is useful to have
real-time,
data-driven methods to classify jobs.
Real-time job classifications could be used to understand
structural changes in the labour market and also to inform the design of future classification schema.
The demand for labour is richly heterogeneous, but neither the level nor the type of disaggregation which
are appropriate to use to study it are readily apparent.
This has been widely acknowledged,
for instance
in Barnichon and Figura (2015), “The appropriate size of a labor market segment, i.e., the definition of the
labor market unit,
is an open question in the literature”,
and Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001),
“The key
problem here is to define the unit of the micro market”.
By type,
we mean distinct ways to organise the
labour market, for instance by region, occupation, or sector.
By level, we mean the level of disaggregation
of the labour market:
with region as the type, this could be at the union (e.g.
United Kingdom), country,
or county level.
Using job adverts posted daily online between 2008 and 2016, we create an empirically driven, ‘bottom-
up’
segmentation of
demand in the labour market which cuts across wage,
sector,
and occupation.
Our
segmentation is created by applying machine learning techniques to the demand for labour expressed in
the text of job descriptions.
We assume that differences in firms’ demand are the most natural organising
structure for the labour market because they are the key determinant of whether a worker can take up a
job or not.
We use text analysis techniques from machine learning to group job vacancies based on the similarity
of their job descriptions in an attempt to get at similarities in what is truly demanded by firms.
We use
1
latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei, Ng and Jordan, 2003; Pritchard, Stephens and Donnelly, 2000), weighted
saliency (Chuang, Manning and Heer, 2012; Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hirtle and Lucca, 2016), silhouette scores
(Rousseeuw,
1987) and the K-means algorithm (Lloyd,
1982) to group vacancies.
This abstracts from
occupation,
sector,
or region unless those factors have an influence on the skills demanded.
Our results
show that the clusters can reproduce groups of jobs familiar in existing classification schemes.
We also show
that these clusters can highlight new careers,
not well
captured by existing classifications.
Furthermore,
our clusters,
which are created based only upon text data,
have explanatory power for offered wages in
vacancies – both in absolute and marginal terms (relative to other categories).
We take advantage of categories which appear in both labour force survey microdata and our bottom-up
clusters in order to take our clusters to the supply side of the labour market.
We use supervised machine
learning to label
each individual
in the survey data with a data-driven cluster classification label.
We
perform similar tests to those used on labour demand and find the same results; our bottom-up clusters are
powerful at capturing well-established groups of workers and contain information which can help to predict
accepted real wages.
Our ‘bottom-up’
approach is one strategy to resolve the question of
what level
of
disaggregation is
appropriate for understanding the demand for labour.
If estimates of structural parameters are dependent
on the type of
disaggregation used,
this method also provides an organising framework which is more
type-neutral
than a disaggregation explicitly by,
for example,
sector.
It could also be applied repeatedly
in different periods to see how the structure of the labour market changes over time.
More broadly,
the
methodology we introduce to do create a ‘natural’ disaggregation could be used to understand a range of
markets beyond the specific case of the labour market for which it is developed.
The strong results we find
with these clusters is indicative of the utility of this approach.
Our paper adds to a small
but growing literature on the analysis of text in job vacancies.
Marinescu
and Wolthoff (2016) use job titles to explain more of
the wage variance in US job vacancies in 2011
than standard occupation classification (SOC) codes alone do.
Deming and Kahn (2017) use job vacancy
descriptions that have been processed into keywords to define general
skills that have explanatory power
for both pay and firm performance beyond the usual labour market classifications.
Grinis (2017) find that
skills associated with so-called STEM subjects (Science,
Technology,
Engineering,
and Mathematics) are
often demanded in job vacancies for non-STEM occupations – providing some motivation for this work.
Turrell et al. (2018) uses the text in job vacancies to apply the usual SOC codes to them, and then looks
at counter-factuals for productivity and output growth in the absence of occupational
mismatch.
Atalay
2
et al.
(2017) follow a similar process for labelling vacancies obtained from newspaper archives with SOC
codes but use the processed data to estimate the extent to which task content shifts are within-occupation
versus across-occupation in accounting for the aggregate decline of routine tasks.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows:
§2 outlines why a data driven segmentation of the labour
market might be useful, §3 describes the vacancy data which we use to construct the segments, §4 explains
the clustering methodology,
§5 describes the clusters as applied to job vacancies,
and §6 applies the same
clusters to the labour force.
§7 concludes.

Motivation
Many analyses of labour markets rely upon official classifications which encode regions, sectors, or occupa-
tions.
However, it is difficult to know what a ‘true’ segmentation of the labour market should or would look
3
like.
If there is substantial movement of workers across categories, analyses based on official classifications
can produce biased results.
The estimation of important structural parameters of models can be affected.
As specific examples, metrics of labour market ‘mismatch’ between workers and jobs are increasing in the
level of disaggregation for the same type of market for both simple and sophisticated indices (Jackman and
Roper, 1987; Şahin et al., 2014), suggesting a guide to an appropriate level of disaggregation may be useful.
Turrell et al. (2018) gives an example where these same mismatch indices differ when changing the type of
disaggregation.
Furthermore, they show empirically that the point estimates of the elasticity parameter of
a labour market matching function can be different across both the type and the level of disaggregation.
We show using data from the ONS Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings
that workers do regularly transition across sector, as classified by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
code,
across occupation,
as classified by Standard Occupational
Classification (SOC) code,
and across
region,
as classified by Nomenclature of Territorial
Units for Statistics (NUTS) code when changing jobs.
These data are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
Official
classifications are a useful
means to categorise different types of
roles in the labour market.
They have the advantage that they are often applied to data in consecutive years or,
if
they are not,
are applied according to a new standard onto which an old standard can usually be mapped.
Similar
classifications internationally allow for cross-country comparisons.
But no official
classification is perfect
and each involves trade-offs.
As noted,
they may bias estimation of structural
parameters if they do not
reflect the underlying moves in the market.
Nathan and Rosso (2015) and Hoberg and Phillips (2016)
demonstrate that classifications may not be updated quickly enough to reflect either changing markets, or
the changing nature of production.
Even if the structure is appropriate, official classifications can be applied inconsistently.
Disagreements
amongst those who code job titles into occupational classes, hereafter ‘coders’, can be substantial (Schierholz
et al., 2016).
The agreement overlap between coders is around 90% at the first-digit of the code (the highest
level,
for instance “Managers,
Directors and Senior Officials”) and reduces to 70–80% at the 3-digit level.
Automated approaches which use job title alone have even lower levels of
agreement;
in Belloni
et al.
(2014),
algorithms which use job title alone agree on only 60% of records even at the top,
1-digit level
of
the International Standard Classification of Occupations.
Our analysis of vacancies through the lens of the
clusters is not sensitive to the official classifications, and so has no bias due to these effects.
However, the
labour force survey data we use to look at accepted wages does employ official classifications.
Having the means to create market segments that are data driven is useful.

sification which emerges can be informative in itself.
The methodology presented could be automatically
deployed by statistical agencies from year to year as a guide to where new clusters of demand are forming,
and to help understand what would be the most useful
revisions to official
classifications in future.
For
analysis of the labour market,
estimates of structural
parameters of models based on data driven classifi-
cations can give confidence to those based upon official classifications, if they are similar, or suggest that a
re-think is required, if they are not.
Counter-intuitively, and because the market segments are data driven
with no reliance on official
classifications,
the methodology presented (but not the actual
clusters) could
help to resolve differences in point estimates across countries and time (which may necessarily use different
official classifications) by producing more comparable results.
Finally, firm demand driven segmentations based upon our methodology could be used to predict worker
flows, when combined with salient information about workers which is outside of the scope of firm demand
(and therefore not included in our clusters), e.g.
current region, age, and level of education.

Data
We use several
datasets from the UK’s Office for National
Statistics (ONS),
including the Labour Force
Survey (LFS) (Office for National Statistics, 2017), the Vacancy Survey, and the Annual
Survey of Hours
and Earnings (ASHE).
1
Our vacancies data are obtained from a job advertisement and employee recruiter, Reed.
2
They consist
of
approximately 15, 242, 000 individual
jobs posted at daily frequency from January 2008 to December
2016.
The fields in the raw data which are typically available for each vacancy include a job posted date,
an offered nominal
wage,
an idiosyncratic sectoral
classification,
a job location,
a job title,
and a job
description.
The value that our data add are that they can give vacancies split by region and occupation,
two disaggregations which are not available in the official statistics on vacancies.
1
We use the ONS mapping from SIC 2003 to SIC 2007 to make entries consistently labelled by SIC 2007 code.
For SOC,
we use fractional mappings from SOC 2k to SOC 2010 on counts to obtain consistently labelled entries.
For transitions, such
as ‘unemployed’ to ‘employed’, we use the modal mappings from SOC 2k to SOC 2010.
NUTS 2010 is used throughout.

Data from the Labour Force Survey.
Our data were originally posted online,
and so do not cover all
job vacancies.
The raw aggregate
series accounts for around 40% of UK vacancies annually.
Previous work has found that online job vacancy
postings can give a good indication of the trends in aggregate vacancies (Hershbein and Kahn, 2016).
There
has been a secular trend increase in the number of vacancies which are posted online, as evidenced by the
replacement in the US of
the Help Wanted Index of
print advertisements with the Help Wanted Online
Series.
Although they may not offer full
coverage,
online vacancy statistics can powerfully complement
official statistics on vacancies, which tend to be based on surveys of firms.
Vacancies posted online are also
unlikely to be representative of all
vacancies advertised in the economy,
introducing a potential
source of
bias.
We show the extent to which our data are representative by using the ONS Vacancy Survey as a
comparator.
The Vacancy Survey is disaggregated by firm size,
and by sector.
Our vacancy data have a

sector field but no firm (or firm size) information, and so we use the appearance of sectoral counts in our data,
and in the Vacancy survey, as a point of comparison to our data.
These are shown as box and swarm plots
over the mean annual ratios in Figure 4.
Noting that the aggregate series under-represents all vacancies, the
average ratio is greater than unity as expected, although sectors representing professionals, administrative
staff, and other service activities are well captured by the data.
The most clearly underrepresented sectors
are public administration and manufacturing,
together accounting for around 9% of vacancies in the last
quarter of
2016 according to the Vacancy Survey.
Around 64% of
vacancies have an annual
ratio with
a median of less than 5.
However,
given the discrepancy between our data and the official
UK data,
we
calculate weights for the stock of vacancies in the Reed data to make it more representative of UK vacancies
as a whole.
These weights are given by the reciprocals of the ratios shown in Figure 4.
In order to calculate the weights (equivalently,
the ratios) some processing is necessary.
In the Reed
dataset,
each individual
vacancy is a flow,
with entries removed after being on the site for 6 weeks.
We
transform this to be in terms of
stocks.

The correlations,
shown in Table 1,
show that the aggregate,
unweighted Reed vacancy time series is better correlated with the Vacancy Survey measure than the Job-
Centre Plus data.

Box and swarm plots of
the distribution of
the mean annual
ratio of
the stocks of
vacancies
between the Vacancy Survey and the Reed data.
Points along the dotted line indicate a ratio of unity for
that sector.
Vacancy Survey in aggregate even more closely,
we weight it using the monthly sectoral
disaggregation
of the Vacancy Survey which improves the correlation to the aggregate Vacancy Survey time series.
4
The
vacancy data are labelled with official classifications following the procedures in Turrell et al. (2018), though
these are not used to derive the market segmentation.
We use the weighted version of the Reed vacancy
data in two applications in this paper:
to create vacancy time series,
and to use as sampling weights for
the vacancies which we use as inputs for the topic model in §4.
4
An empirically driven segmentation of the labour market
We assume that the skills demanded by firms are the most natural
way to aggregate the labour market
because this is a key determinant of
whether a worker can move job or not.
An accurate grouping of
vacancies and employment would have predominantly diagonal entries in its equivalent of Figures 1 and 2
(if the clusters were also used on the supply of labour).
To try and capture the bundles of skills that make
up firms’ demand for labour, our proxy variable is the text expressing the demand for labour in job vacancy
descriptions in the Reed data.
Job descriptions do not provide a perfect or noiseless measure of demand.
For example,
some of the
4
The bespoke Reed sectors are mapped into single letter Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) sections.
The weight of
a vacancy v in sector i and month m is given by
ω
i,m
= V
vs
i,m
/V
i,m
with VS the vacancy survey.
This improves the match to the aggregate time series.
Weighting the Reed data reduces bias but
increases variance.
8
text in them is designed to prompt job-seekers to apply by extolling the virtues of the firm, or by explaining
how exciting the role is.
In the following,
we explain how we abstract from some of
this noise and only
retain text features which do express the demand for labour.
To transform the demand expressed in job vacancies into mutually exclusive market segments which are
data driven we follow a four step process.
For computational reasons, only a third of vacancies are initially
used to create the market segments.
We sample these using the weights from the ONS Vacancy Survey (see
§3).
In the first step, the text associated with each job vacancy is cleaned and the title and job description
are combined into a single ‘document’ per vacancy.
In the second step, a topic model is run over the entire
longitudinal
corpus,
creating N topics which help determine the type of disaggregation which is the most
appropriate given the input data.
Our type will be a distribution over the usual official classifications.
We
also use an algorithm to choose N ,
thus helping to determining the best level
of disaggregation in topics.
In the usual
classifications,
this would reflect the granularity of
the classification,
for instance a single
street,
a village,
a county,
or a country.
In our case,
having more levels might result in a cluster which
represents education and teaching as a whole being split into teachers and teaching assistants, or primary
and secondary school teachers.
A priori, we do not know how the algorithm will decide to split clusters at
higher levels of disaggregation.
In the third step, each job vacancy is represented in the N -dimensional space of all topics and is then
grouped into one of K market segments which are our final types of market segment.
We interchangeably
call
them clusters as they draw together many jobs into groups.
The intuition behind having both topics
and clusters is that topics can represent many different skills,
tasks,
or aspects of a job separately,
while
clusters are larger groups of these skills.
More practically,
this step is needed because the objective is to
obtain a classification which has discrete, mutually exclusive membership.
We use the K-means algorithm
(Lloyd,
1982) for this,
which allows for a vacancy represented in a vector space to either be classed as k
or k
0
,
but not as both.
The representation of
vacancies in the space of
all
topics is not suitable for this
purpose as it is continuous,
rather than discrete,
and it is N -dimensional.
Figure 5 is a schematic of how
a set of
points (vacancies) in the topic space are assigned to K mutually exclusive clusters.
In keeping
with the ‘bottom-up’ philosophy, we determine both K and N , on which K is dependent, using data-driven
algorithms.
The value for K then gives the final say on what the level
of disaggregation is.
With K fixed,
these clusters define our ‘natural’ view of the UK labour market.
In the fourth and final step,
we use machine learning on this cluster-labelled dataset to train a model
9
which can map unseen vacancies to a cluster.
We use this trained model
to apply cluster labels to the
remaining 2/3 of the data.

Schematic example of how vacancies, represented by points, are located in the topic vector space
and assigned to clusters k ∈ {0, . . . , K}.
The first and N th dimensions of the topic vector space are projected
onto a 2D plane.
Also shown are three example K-means areas, divided by classification boundaries.
The
K-means boundaries are for illustrative purposes only; see Lloyd (1982) for a full description of how K-means
assigns points to each distinct k value.
4.1
Step 1:
Cleaning documents
In the cleaning process,
each document is created as a combination of the text of the job description and
title with all
punctuation removed.
Stopwords,
such as ‘the’,
‘to’,
‘as’,
are removed,
as are any digits or
single letters.
We also impose an upper and lower bound on the frequency of the number of occurrences of
a word in each document.
The maximum threshold,
5 × 10
5
occurrences across documents,
is applied to
remove very common words such as ‘experience’, ‘work’ and ‘team’, which provide little useful information
about the job.
The lower threshold is 10
5
,
and this removes words that do not appear commonly across
job descriptions; some of these are mispelt words.
This forms the cleaned corpus.
4.2
Step 2:
Creating topics based on demand
In the second step, the topic model we use is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng and Jordan, 2003)
as implemented in the gensim Python package (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010).
This uses the online variational
Bayes algorithm (Hoffman,
Bach and Blei,
2010).
The LDA model
is fed a weighted random sample of 5

Weighted saliency
Figure 6:
Weighted saliency score, defined in equation (2) and labelled ζ, is used to determine the optimal
number of topics.
The error bars are from 5 different Monte Carlo runs of the algorithm, each on a random
sample of 10
6
vacancies from the dataset.
million job vacancies from the total
dataset.
Computational
limitations necessitate the use of
a sample.
The reasoning behind using a random sample weighted with the weights from §3 is that this gives clusters
representative of the labour market as a whole; if the weights had been omitted the topics would have been
dominated by finer details from jobs which are very common in this dataset, such as in sales occupations.
Once selected for inclusion, the LDA algorithm treats each individual vacancy in the same way.
In LDA, each document d is assumed to be a mixture of latent topics, and each topic is a distribution
over words appearing in the corpus as a whole.
Take w
ld
to be the lth word in document d,
θ to be the
distribution of
topic weights over documents,
and β to be the distribution of
word weights over topics.
LDA may be thought of
as a probabilistic factorisation of
the matrix of
word counts into the matrix
of
topic weights θ of
dimension D × N and the dictionary of
topics β of
dimension L × N in which
P (w
ld
) =
P
n
θ
dn
β
ln
.
It is assumed that θ
d
∼ Dirichlet(κ) for the distribution of topic weights over each
document d, that β
n
∼ Dirichlet(η) for the distribution of word weights over each topic n, that topic weight
n
ld
∼ Categorical(θ
d
) and that word w
ld
∼ Categorical(β
n
ld
).
LDA is used to analyse documents via the
posterior distributions of β, θ, and topic assignments n:
that is, it finds P (n, θ, β|w, κ, η).
The words w
ld
are the only observables; there are priors for the parameters κ and η for which we use the gensim defaults.
LDA tells us nothing about the number of topics to choose;
that is N is an input of the algorithm rather
than an output.
In the limit of large N , there are as many topics as terms and, in the limit of very small
N , topics will be very broad and difficult to interpret.
11
To determine an optimal
value for N using the data,
we use the ‘weighted saliency’
as our criterion
function (Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hirtle and Lucca, 2016).
Alternatives to this approach include maximising
the coherence of
topics (Röder,
Both and Hinneburg,
2015) or maximising the topic stability (Greene,
O’Callaghan and Cunningham,
2014).
The approach we follow relies on earlier work which defines the
‘saliency’ of words within the corpus (Chuang, Manning and Heer, 2012) as
s(w|n) = P (w) × d(w|n)
(1)
with P (w) the probability of choosing a word at random from our corpus and d(w|n) the distinctiveness of
a word given a topic n.
d(w|n) is given by
d(w|n) = P (n|w) ln

P (n|w)
P (n)

Distinctiveness,
d(w|n),
determines how likely a word is associated with topic n;
in statistical
mechanics
terms it is the relative entropy of P (n|w) with respect to P (n),
or equivalently the point-wise Kullback-
Leibler divergence.
P (n|w) may be calculated using that P (w|n) ≡ β and Bayes’ theorem,
i.e.
P (n|w) =
P (w|n)P (n)/P (w).
The distinctiveness drives the saliency measure in (1) by giving low weight to words
which are very prevalent within the corpus,
i.e.
high P (w),
but which are associated with many topics.
This allows words mentioned infrequently but associated with a single topic to be identified.
P (n) is the
likelihood of topic n controlling for document length,
P (n) =
P
D
d=1
θ
n,d
L
d
P
N
n=1
P
D
d=1
θ
n,d
L
d
We use code from the pyLDAviz package to implement this (Sievert and Shirley,
2014).
The weighted
saliency (Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hirtle and Lucca, 2016) sums the saliency score of the top five words given
each topic with weights given by a measure of the average load of topic n across documents.
More rigorously,
define
l
i+1,n
:= {s(w
l
|n) ∈ s(w|n)
i
: s(w
l
|n) ≥ s(w
l
0
|n)∀s(w
l
0
|n) ∈ s(w|n)
i
}
as the set of the top i + 1 values of s(w|n) for unique words,
and the set s(w|n)
i+1
:= s(w|n)
i
\ l
i+1,n
as
12
the set of s(w|n) with those entries removed.
Then the weighted saliency is given by
ζ(N) =
N
X
n=1
λ
n
X
x∈l
5,n
x
(2)
The average load of topic n across documents is given by
λ
n
=
1
D
D
X
d=1
θ
n,d
Maximising ζ(N ) with respect to N determines a set of topics which both contains salient words,
which
help distinguish between topics via the term in salient words in equation (2),
and which are important
across documents, through the term in λ
n
.
Figure 6 shows ζ for our corpus, which does not demonstrate a
clear and unambiguous peak.
There is a plateau of high, statistically indistinguishable values of weighted
saliency between N = 8 and N = 20.
In the next step,
the documents will
be clustered based upon how
similar the topics expressed in documents are.
Noting that the decrease in ζ between N = 8 and N = 20 is
within the error bars, and that the clustering is designed to produce an efficient representation of the data
(discarding topic dimensions which do not carry useful
information),
we opt for the maximum number of
topics on the plateau, N = 20.
For comparison, official classifications use 90 3-digit SOC codes, 25 2-digit
SOC codes, and 9 1-digit SOC codes, or NUTS codes of which there are 12, 40, and 174 at the 1, 2, and 3
character UK levels respectively.
There are 21 SIC ‘sections’.
Figure 7 shows the topics created by the LDA algorithm along with their topic weights over the entire
corpus.
Within each topic,
the size of
the words shown is given by β
n
,
the distribution of
word weights
over that topic.
In order to protect the information in individual
vacancies,
only words which appear in
several
job titles are shown in the bottom right-hand panel.
Some topics clearly contain words related to
a particular occupation, for instance n = 4 contains ‘teachers’, ‘school’, and ‘education’.
n = 14 is clearly
related to the preparation of food.
Other topics are much less easy to interpret in terms of traditional jobs,
for instance n = 0 contains ‘project’, ‘planning’, and ‘operations’ but do not seem to relate to a particular
occupation or industry.
Similarly,
n = 2 seems to be about compliance and safety standards rather than
a specific type of
job.
In runs with a larger number of
topics (larger N ),
the marginal
topics became
increasingly uninterpretable.
Eventually topics were added which were clearly not expressing demand.
We do not know ex ante whether our topics are the best grouping of different themes expressed in the
corpus.
Particularly,
as N increases,
the number of topics which are not useful
in understanding distinct
roles also increases.
For example,
at larger N ,
a diversity topic,
which advertised firms’

Topic 19
Figure 7:
The topics output by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm.
Each word’s size corresponds
to its weighting within the topic,
i.e.
the words are scaled according to θ.
Only words which appear in
numerous vacancy descriptions are shown.

Silhouette Score
Figure 8:
Mean silhouette score,
¯
S, for a range of values of K.
Equation (3) gives the definition of silhouette
score for each total
cluster number K and document d.
The mean silhouette scores shown are from ten
repeats using 5 × 10
4
randomly sampled vacancies in each repeat.
best practice in hiring but which was not useful in distinguishing between types of labour, began to appear.
4.3
Step 3:
Clustering similar jobs in mutually exclusive groups
To retain only the useful
information contained in topics,
but discard that which says little about how
vacancies might be (dis-)similar, we turn to the third step, using ‘K-means’ (Lloyd, 1982).
Each vacancy is
a vector of topics, θ
d
, embedded within the vector space defined by the topics.
K-means clusters documents
(vacancies) which are close in this space into K mutually exclusive groups using the Euclidean norm to find
a partition of the D documents into the K < D clusters which minimises the within cluster sum of squares.
K is an input into the K-means algorithm.
Following our strategy of letting the data speak, we use the silhouette score to determine K (Rousseeuw,
1987).
This score is maximised by maximising the inter-cluster distance while minimising the intra-cluster
distance; that is, documents representing vacancies in the topic vector space should be in regions that are
both well-separated tightly defined.
Let ¯
a be the mean distance between a document d and every other
document within the same cluster, and let
¯
b be the mean distance between document d and every point in
the next nearest cluster.
Then,
S
K,d
=
¯
b − ¯
a
max(¯
a,
¯
b)
(3)
To choose K,
we find the maximum of
the mean silhouette score,
¯
S as a function of
K.
Note that the
computation of this metric is intensive,
with O(max {K} · d
2
) operations.
Given this,
the average of ten
15
random samples of 1% of documents is taken.
The mean silhouette score for a range of values of K is shown
in Figure 8, and exhibits a distinct peak at K = 20.
The clustering process is a way of discarding topics which apply to all vacancies but which are not useful
in discriminating between different parts of the labour market.
As a robustness check, we verified that as N
gets larger, a K < N is chosen.
Not knowing that N = K ex ante in this case provides one justification for
performing the clustering step.
In calculations not shown, we also found that
¯
S is a function of N , giving
further motivation for determining N through the weighted saliency measure before determining K.
5
Labour market demand from the bottom-up
Having determined N = 20 and K = 20 for the corpus,
the vacancies as represented in the vector space
defined by topics are grouped into clusters.
Table 2 shows the top three words common to the job vacancies
assigned to each cluster.
Some roles are very clear and distinct amongst them,
for instance k = 18 is the
legal
profession,
k = 6 is software development,
and k = 19 are sales assistants.
This is remarkable given
that at no point were these different roles explicitly signalled to the algorithm.
Job vacancies have local idiosyncrasies; the word ‘class’, appearing in k = 11 refers to the different classes
of light or heavy goods vehicles licences available in the UK. With ‘driver’ as the other most common word,
this suggests that k = 11 captures drivers of goods vehicles.
Some of the clusters are very directly related to the original topic dimensions.
Cluster k = 2 is repre-
sented by ‘teaching’, ‘school’, and ‘teacher’ and strongly overlaps with words associated with topic n = 4.
The specific characteristics of this cluster are shown in Figure 9,
which shows,
starting from the top left
hand panel
and proceeding clockwise,
the most common words from across the corpus of
this cluster’s
documents (including titles), the number of jobs within this cluster which have each 1-digit SOC code, the
count of
vacancies within this cluster by region per unit of
labour force in that region,
the top 10 ONS
sectors (SIC) by count of vacancies within this cluster, the most common trigrams drawn from the job titles
within this cluster, the top 10 occupations by 3-digit SOC code within this cluster, the count of permanent
versus temporary jobs within this cluster, and the nominal offered salary per annum as a probability density
function.
Note that these jobs are almost completely concentrated in the ‘education’ sector, and most are
in a single 3-digit SOC code.
Even weighted by the number of people in the labour force in each region, the
jobs are very highly concentrated in London.
There are a substantial number of topics which have a strong
overlap with a specific cluster because they directly relate to an area of labour market demand.
n = 14 to
k = 7, ‘chef’, ‘food’, and ‘restaurant’, is another.

Cluster 5
Figure 10:
The properties of the vacancies which are sorted into cluster 5,
which are found across many
different SOC, NUTS, and SIC codes.
Descriptions of each panel are in the text.
19
These traditional
jobs are easy to classify and the extra utility of the bottom-up process is low;
these
jobs are already well captured by official classifications.
However, that these topics are cleanly mapped into
the relevant clusters gives confidence in the algorithm:
the clusters are aggregating truly similar jobs rather
than similar features of advertisements for different types of job.
They are created without supervision.
What of the topics which were less obviously associated with a traditional role? Topics n = 0 and n = 2
are examples.
For example, job vacancies with a strong score in topic n = 0 were most likely to be assigned
to cluster k = 5.
As shown in Figure 10,
k = 5 is much less well
described by existing classifications.
It
is comparatively strongly driven by n-grams (up to trigrams) such as ‘business development manager’ and
‘project manager’.
These types of
job can be in a range of
industries (SIC codes) or occupations (SOC
codes) as shown in the sectoral
and occupational
breakdown panels in Figure 10.
Cluster k = 16,
which
mainly draws on topic n = 2 (‘safety’,
‘plan’,
‘risk’,
‘compliance’),
is similarly split across SIC and SOC
codes.
It is feasible that workers could move between official classifications in order to take up these types of job.
This demonstrates the power of the bottom-up approach; it details roles which break the barriers between
traditional labour market segments.
Relatively recent changes in the nature of work in some industries are
also reflected in the cluster-related words shown in Table 2; while marketing is not a new career, it appears
in cluster k = 9 alongside ‘digital’.
5.1
Step 4:
Mapping remaining vacancies into clusters
For computational reasons,
only a third of vacancies (sampled by the weights created in §3) were used to
create the clusters.
In order to apply these clusters to the other 2/3 of our data,
we created a simplified
version of the 20 dimensional space defined by the topics.
The vector space was simplified by only using the
rows of β corresponding to the top 200 words by weight for each topic.
As might be anticipated from Zipf’s
law, there is a long tail of low weight words for each topic and using the top 200 words vastly simplifies the
computational time required to turn vacancies into vectors in the topic space.
On a training set of 80,000
vacancies labelled with clusters,
we applied several
supervised classification methods and checked their
out-of-sample accuracy on 20,000 vacancies with known labels.
The k-Nearest-Neighbours classification
algorithm performed the best,
and was subsequently trained on 10
6
labelled vacancies (test set of
10
5
,
out-of-sample accuracy 79%) before being used as the model
to label
all
∼ 10

vacancies which were not
initially assigned to a cluster.

Testing the demand-based vacancy clusters
If these clusters capture the demand for labour quantitatively, then the time series of the stocks of vacancies
in clusters which clearly capture careers well
described by existing classifications will
be very strongly
correlated to the time series of
those same careers using the stock of
vacancies as counted according to
the official
classifications.
Example of
such careers include teachers,
nurses,
and chefs.
In Table 3 we
present the correlation of the time series of these easily identified types of cluster (e.g.
teachers) with their
closest known SIC code (e.g.
Education) and SOC code (e.g.
Teaching and educational professionals).
The
correlations are shown under the ‘Vacancies’ heading.
These correlations are calculated from the quarterly
time series over the entire,
fully labelled dataset of vacancies broken down by the relevant cluster group,
SIC code, and SOC code.
Vacancies labelled by SOC code are not available from the ONS and are drawn
from Turrell
et al.
(2018).
The cluster description column in Table 3 features the three most common
words associated with that cluster.
These vacancy cluster time series are very strongly correlated with the
relevant vacancy time series using the official classifications.
To determine whether the clusters are informative for the description of the demand for labour more
broadly,
we performed ordinary least squares regressions of
the logarithm of
the real
offered wage with
dummies for each month, and then varied the categories used as explanatory variables.
This again used the
full dataset only excluding the 5% of entries on either end of the real wage distribution.
As Table 4 shows
with ‘Yes’ indicating which categories are used as explanatory variables, the bottom-up clusters had more
power than the commonly used disaggregation of the labour market by sector, and also by region, but did
not predict wages as strongly as occupation.
All models have a joint F-test significance level of p < 0.01 as
indicated by ∗ ∗ ∗.
Note that there are
p = 40(NUTS 2 regions) + 25(SOC 2 codes) + 21(SIC sections) + 20(clusters) = 106
explanatory variables, but 10

We speculate that occupations are a better predictor of
offered wages because our clusters ‘collapse’
the different levels of
the same career into a single sub-market,
thus combining a range of
wage levels.
For instance,
for teaching this could be classroom assistant,
teacher,
and head teacher.
These would be
given different occupational codes, but would all sit in the same cluster – and descriptions of them in the
vacancies are likely to be similar.
This could suggest a role for a ‘seniority’ dimension of the classification
to discriminate rungs of
the same type of
job.
As regression VI shows compared to V,
the clusters also
provide extra power relative to the three other categories.
6
Labour market supply from the bottom-up
Thus far,
the data which created these clusters (the Reed vacancy data) have also been used to evaluate
their performance.
Now we attempt to apply the same clusters to the supply side of
the labour market
(the labour force).
Ideally,
we would do this by using these clusters to predict the transitions of workers
– that is, if these clusters truly capture the careers available to workers then the within cluster job-to-job
transition rates should dominate the without cluster job-to-job transition rates.
A formal model which did
this would also include information on workers which is outside of the scope of our demand driven clusters,
e.g.
on the workers’
current region,
age,
and level
of
education.
With all
of
that information included,
transition rates using the clusters as a predictor could be compared to transition rates based on sectoral or
occupational classifications.
Although we attempted to obtain the data on hires which would allow these calculations to be performed,
they are not feasible with the LFS in the form in which it is currently available.
To create the hires data
by cluster, it would be necessary to first match, record-by-record, the longitudinal and cross-sectional LFS.
The matching is needed as the longitudinal
LFS does not contain all
of
the variables necessary for the
22
machine learning algorithm to be run.
We tried several methods of creating a unique match variable, but
none yielded reasonable time series for the stocks or flows of employment or unemployment in the matched
data.
This prevented us from creating a cluster equivalent of the job-to-job flows of Figures 1 and 2.
This
would be an important check on the method of creating the clusters in future work,
if the required data
can be obtained.
Instead, we apply our cluster labels to the cross-sectional LFS alone, and test their performance via their
explanatory power for wages,
and in the degree to which the time series of similar clusters,
occupations,
and sectors correlate.
We use the LFS data from 2008 to 2015 inclusive, close to the same time period as
our vacancy data (which differs in that it also includes 2016).
Applying the natural market clusters to the labour force is constrained by the set of information which
is shared both by our vacancy data and by the labour force survey data (the latter do not come with the job
descriptions which we used to label the former).
Let each cluster be labelled k, with k ∈ {0, . . . , K − 1}.
The
problem is to predict k for each i using ~x
i
a vector of information on each individual in the cross-sectional
LFS. We seek a function G such that
~y = G(X)
where ~y is a vector of values of k ∈ {0, . . . , K − 1} for all i ∈ I.
There is no job description in the survey
data,
so the approach used in §5 is not applicable.
We solve this classification problem by using the data
fields which exist in both the vacancy data and in the fields related to individuals in the LFS. We train the
model on the data fields in the vacancy data for which we have a known cluster, and then apply the trained
model to the same fields in the LFS. The information set on an individual in the LFS which overlaps with
the information in each job vacancy is given by
~x
0
i
= (SOC, NUTS, SIC, ln real wage)
i
(4)
where these variables pertain to the job occupied by those employed and the job sought or job last occupied
for those unemployed.
The first three variables are discrete, with the fourth continuous and only relevant
in the case of employed individuals.
The SOC code is at the 3-digit level,
the NUTS code at 1-digit,
and
the SIC codes are at the section level.
To build a model which will associate each individual i at each time t with a cluster k, we train a support
vector classification algorithm
5

ˆ
G on the problem y

= G(~x

) with ~x

We tried several
algorithms at smaller scales for this problem,
with support vector classification consistently providing
the best performance.

set as in equation (4) but for a vacancy v.
We use 10
6
of the originally labelled vacancies, holding out 20%
of these as a test set.
Any difference between the vacancy data and the LFS could create problems for the accuracy of the
trained support vector classification algorithm when applied to the LFS.
There are some significant dif-
ferences.
Firstly,
if there exist some combinations of valid and null
entries across the dimensions of X in
the vacancy data (on which it is trained) which are not present in the matched LFS data (on which it is
deployed), the model is unlikely to label these combinations with high accuracy.
The combinations of null
and valid entries are just the most simple type of difference; if the two datasets have different distributions
over the valid entries in each classification, and there are many possible combinations of these valid entries.
As the LFS data represent supply and filled jobs, while the vacancy data represent demand, the expectation
would be that these distributions are different in general.
Due to the nature of machine learning, this issue
may be a bigger factor for continuous variables than discrete ones.
The model is trained on offered wages,
which reflect the demand for labour,
while the wages of those working are the equilibrium price paid for
labour, and these are not necessarily the same, though we necessarily treat them as such for the purposes
of the application of cluster labels to the LFS. Finally, if real wages change considerably across the period
captured by the classification,
then this may reduce the performance of the algorithm.
However,
average
aggregate UK real wage growth has been close to zero for much of 2008 to 2016 inclusive.
We try to correct for the first problem in which some entries in ~x
i
are null
(i.e.
missing) for some
individuals i,
but the same combination of
null
entries never occurs in ~x
v
for any v.
We do this by
artificially flipping some of
the valid entries in the vacancy data to be null.
For the overlapping data
columns in X, the vacancies are cleaner than the LFS in the sense that there are far fewer missing entries
apart from 3.3% which have missing offered wages.
The LFS data have many more null entries.
Out of a
possible 2
4
combinations of having categories with null entries or not, the LFS microdata we use exhibits 14
of them, of which 6 are substantial (see Table 5).
Note that in Table 5, a considerable percentage of entries
do not have any of
the ~x
i
data attached at all.

will most likely revert to picking a cluster with the probability implied by the frequency
of appearance of that cluster in the vacancy data.
This makes any application of the clusters as applied to
the LFS likely to be noisy and error-prone.
We flip entries in the vacancy data used for training to ensure a balanced set in which the percentage
of occurrences of each substantial
case in Table 5 is set to be equal.
That is,
we flip some entries to null
for the vacancy test and train data so that it has an almost equal
representation of each combination of
null and valid classifications in the LFS, as shown in Table 6.
Training on a balanced set ensures that the
trained model
is not biased toward any particular case of the six highlighted in Table 5.
Both the train
and test vacancy sets are re-balanced in this way.
With this configuration,
the out-of-sample accuracy of
the support vector classification on the vacancy test set was 42.0%.
There is no equivalent in- or out-of-sample test for the accuracy of
the algorithm which applies the
clusters to the LFS.
As in §5,
we test the correlations of
cluster time series with official
classification
time series,
but using the data on those who are employed,
and we test the extent to which the cluster
classifications explain real wages.
Because of the noted problems with applying the clusters to the LFS, we
prefer correlations of time series to comparisons of the levels.
The ‘Employed’ column of Table 3 shows the
correlation between the clusters representing teachers, chefs, and nurses with their closest equivalent SOC
and SIC categories.
As with the vacancy time series, the correlation is very strong for teaching (cluster 2).
For the other two clusters, chefs (cluster 7) and nurses (cluster 8), the correlation with SIC sections is very
good, above 0.9 in both cases.
However, by SOC code, the correlations perform much less well.
There is a
positive correlation for cluster 7 and the ‘Food preparation and hospitality trades’ SOC code, but it is much
smaller.
For cluster 8, the correlation with ‘Nursing and midwifery professionals’ is negative.
There may be
reasons for the poorer performance by SOC code.
As noted, 53.5% of all cases do not have any information,
but the fraction of invalid entries is actually worse for SIC than for SOC, as shown in Table 5.
The analysis
is carried out at the 3-digit SOC level,
introducing a higher level
of noise and difficulty for the algorithm
due to the 90 categories versus just 21 for SIC sections.
The SOC classification was revised in 2010,

our data from before this time have to be mapped modally into the new version of the SOC standard.
This
may be having an effect on the apparent performance of the clustering.
The correlation of these time series
from Q1 2011 onwards is shown in brackets by the two employed SOC correlation entries for clusters 7 and
8,
and these indicate a better match for this post-classification change time period.
Indeed,
223 did not
exist in the SOC2000 standard and 543 has a significant number of non-zero diagonal
entries in the best
available fractional mapping from the SOC2000 standard to the SOC2010 standard.
Using the cluster-labelled LFS data, we run regressions with, separately, fixed effects for region, sector,
occupation,
and cluster,
as well
as all
of
these together.
As in §5,
we perform ordinary least squares
regressions of
the logarithm of
the real
wage with dummies for each month.
The results are shown in
Table 7.
All regressions have additional controls for quarter, age, age
2
, year, gender, and job type.
Again,
the 5% on the ends of the real wage distribution is removed.
As before, n  p so that Adjusted R
2
≈ R
2
.
The clusters have a higher R
2
than the regressions on region or sector, and a lower value than the regression
for occupation.
There is an important difference between Model IV of Table 7 and Model IV of Table 4; in the latter,
the clusters do not rely on any information about wages but do have explanatory power for wages.
The
relationship is not so clean in Model IV of Table 7, as the machine learned function G(~x
i
), which assigns an
individual represented by ~x
0
i
= (SOC, NUTS, SIC, ln real wage)
i
to a cluster, uses information on real wages.
This makes the interpretation of the non-zero R
2
value in Model IV of Table 7 different too; it demonstrates
that G finds real
wage information useful
in assigning individuals to clusters which were initially created
without any wage information.
Although the interpretation differs to that of Table 4,
the non-zero R
2
is
still a strong indication that the clusters carry useful information about accepted real wages.
There is another subtlety in the regression table,
in Model
VI.
If the function G(~x
i
) were linear,
then
26
regressing on clusters in addition to region, sector, and occupation would not add any explanatory power.
This is because variation due to cluster would be entirely accounted for by x
i
.
However,
support vector
regression,
which determines our estimate of the function G,
ˆ
G,
is a non-linear machine learning method
and as such the cluster fixed effect can increase the value of R
2
beyond the other three classifications.
Overall,
Table 7 confirms the results of Table 4;
the bottom-up clusters have more explanatory power
than region or sector but less than occupation,
and they provide a small
amount of
additional
power in
combination with the other three types of category.
Note that this table necessarily only includes employed
individuals who disclosed their wage.
All
models have a joint F-test significance level
of
p < 0.01 as
indicated by ∗ ∗ ∗.
We speculate that, just as for offered wage, the clusters are limited in their explanatory
power for accepted wages relative to occupations because they collapse different levels of the same career.
7
Conclusion
Using the text in the job descriptions of job vacancies is a promising way to better understand different
groupings in the labour market, and one which both sidesteps and complements the usual top-down classi-
fications.
We have shown that machine learning tools provide empirical methods to choose both the type
and level of disaggregation used for analysis.
Analysis of this kind could help to inform future taxonomies
of jobs and gives an indication of what the ‘true’ structure of the job market is.
As applied to job vacancies, the clusters which are created align well to traditional roles where appropri-
ate but also suggest types of sub-market which are not obviously present in current classification schemes
based on region,
sector,
or occupation alone.
The clusters have explanatory power for the offered wages
associated with job vacancies.
Though applying the same clusters to the labour force is challenging due to
a lack of appropriate information, we have also shown that the clusters contain some information relating
to accepted wages, and that the correlation between the clusters which capture clearly defined roles, such
as teacher, and the equivalent time series using official classifications is high.
The extent to which the derived clusters can currently be applied to the labour force is inhibited by the
availability of data which overlaps with vacancy data.
Future improvements in the labour force data could
change this, and allow for a richer analysis of whether this demand-driven methodology is more successful
at describing job-to-job flows than other classifications.
Given the expected rapid disruption to the demand for tasks, and therefore occupations, from automa-
tion, this methodology for a data driven taxonomy of jobs could be useful for statistical agencies and labour
market economists.
The clustering approach could provide a useful method for understanding sub-markets
27
in, for instance, vacancies that exist within a wider economic area spanning several countries that each have
their own distinct statistical classifications.
There are many potential
extensions and modifications to this work.
Our topic model,
which informs
our labour market segments,
is based upon the text in job descriptions alone but structural
topic models
would allow other information to be included in the creation of the topics, for instance on offered wages or
using time as an input variable.
The wage regressions undertaken suggest that adding a second dimension
to our clusters which would capture the seniority of a position within a market segment could boost the
explanatory power of our bottom-up method for wages.
It would be in principle possible to do this using
text analysis techniques applied to job descriptions.
While the empirical
possibilities have been made clear,
there is not as yet any theory which might
explain, endogenously, what determines the number of sub-markets.
Our approach has implicitly assumed
that the labour market segments we find are mutually exclusive,
but some workers will
always transition
across different classification codes in any mutually exclusive classification.
This suggests that a more
sophisticated future approach might see jobs assigned to a fuzzy set of
sub-markets rather than being
bivalently assigned to clusters.
More broadly, combining naturally occurring, semi-unstructured data and highly structured survey data
is likely to be a recurring challenge.
There is typically little control
over the information set covered by
naturally occurring data, but if the information gathered by surveys can be more closely aligned with the
information types found in naturally occurring data, the benefits of combining both could be realised more
often.
