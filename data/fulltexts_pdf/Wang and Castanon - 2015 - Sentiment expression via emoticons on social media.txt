Abstract—Emoticons (e.g., :) and :( ) have been widely used 
in sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks as features to ma-
chine learning algorithms or as entries of sentiment lexicons. 
In this paper, we argue that while emoticons are strong and 
common signals of sentiment expression on social media the 
relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity are not 
always clear. Thus, any algorithm that deals with sentiment 
polarity should take emoticons into account but extreme cau-
tion should be exercised in which emoticons to depend on. 
First, to demonstrate the prevalence of emoticons on social 
media, we analyzed the frequency of emoticons in a large re-
cent Twitter data set. Then we carried out four analyses to 
examine the relationship between emoticons and sentiment 
polarity as well as the contexts in which emoticons are used. 
The first analysis surveyed a group of participants for their 
perceived sentiment polarity of the most frequent emoticons. 
The second analysis examined clustering of words and emoti-
cons to better understand the meaning conveyed by the emoti-
cons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of 
microblog posts before and after emoticons were removed from 
the text. The last analysis tested the hypothesis that removing 
emoticons from text hurts sentiment classification by training 
two machine learning models with and without emoticons in 
the text respectively. The results confirms the arguments that: 
1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable signals of sentiment 
polarity and one should take advantage of them in any senti-
ment analysis; 2) a large group of the emoticons conveys com-
plicated sentiment hence they should be treated with extreme 
caution.

Emoticons, such as 
:) ;) :-)
and 
:(
, are frequent-
ly used online in social media, IM (e.g., Skype), blogs, 
forums, and other kinds of online social interactions. Be-
cause they are commonly used in online communications 
and they are often direct signals of sentiment, emoticons 
in text were widely used by NLP researchers in tasks such 
as sentiment analysis as features to machine learning algo-
rithms or as entries of sentiment lexicons for rule-based 
approaches. 
Different online communities and tools may elicit var-
ied degrees of emoticon usage. Twitter, a microblogging 
site, is one of most popular social media. For researchers 
and businesses, having access to its huge amount of user-
generated data is critical for understanding user behavior 
and the sentiment expressed. With access to about 50 mil-
lion tweets per day (through the Twitter Decahose API), 
we thought it would be interesting to understand the prev-
alence of emoticons on Twitter nowadays, how users ex-
press 
and 
perceive 
sentiment 
through 
emoticons, 
and 
whether emoticons can be used as a reliable cue for senti-
ment polarity classification.

There has been abundant studies on sentiment analysis 
in recent years[1]. In particular, its application on social 
media posts has gathered a lot of interests in both academ-
ia and the industry [2-6]. 
In many of the past studies, emoticons played an im-
portant role in both building sentiment lexicons and in 
training machine learning classifiers [2, 7-12]. It has been 
thought that emoticons are reliable indicators of senti-
ment. Several attempts have been made to build sentiment 
corpus based on emoticons [10, 13, 14]. However, none of 
the studies has directly examined the relationship between 
emoticons and sentiment polarity on social media as well 
as the roles of emoticons in such context. This work aims 
to fill the gap and answer the following questions: 1) how 
prevalent are emoticons on Twitter today? 2) how are 
emoticons used and in what context? 3) what meaning do 
emoticons convey? 4) how do emoticons help in express-
ing sentiment? 5) are emoticons reliable cues for senti-
ment?

Users of social media and IM tools use a variety of 
emoticons. Some of the emoticons, such as 
:)
and 
:(
, 
are widely used and many others are only used by a frac-
tion of users. We compiled a relatively comprehensive list 
of 164 emoticons from previous studies and the Wikipedia 
[15, 16]. 
We then searched for any emoticon in that list in a very 
large Twitter data set that contains all the tweets collected 
through the Twitter Decahose API in the entire month of 
March 2015 (the Twitter Decahose API provides 10% of 
entire Twitter traffic). A tweet, which is one microblog 
post, contains 140 characters maximum. The data set con-
tains roughly 1.5 billion tweets. 8,625,753 of emoticons 
were found in that data set. Majority of the tweets contain 
only one emoticon. 
Table 1 lists the most frequent emoticons and their fre-
quency in our data set. 
:)
alone were used more than 
43% of the times. As expected, many of the emoticons 
were used infrequently. For the rest of the analyses in this 
paper, we selected and used the emoticons that occurred 
more than 0.1%, which results in the 34 emoticons in Ta-
ble 1. In summary, we have shown that emoticons, espe-
cially the few widely used ones, are prevalent in tweets.

MOTICONS AND 
S
ENTIMENT
In sentiment analysis, polarity of sentiment (e.g., posi-
tive, negative or neutral) is of particular interest to re-
searchers and business applications. However, the emo-
tions expressed by the emoticons often cannot be captured 
by the three polarity categories. Many emoticons do not 
belong to exactly one of the categories. For example, 
:/
is often used to express an emotional state of annoyed and 
uneasy, which could be an indication of negative senti-
ment for some people but neutral for others. To validate 
and quantify this intuition, we did a survey of emotions 
expressed by the 34 emoticons in Table 1. 31 participants 
completed 
the 
survey. 
Each 
participant 
was 
asked 
to 
choose one from the following four options for each emot-
icon: 
Positive
, 
Negative
, 
Neutral
, and 
None of the above 
or not sure
. Fig. 1 summarizes the results as the propor-
tion of all responses for each option and emoticon. The 
results are very interesting while largely expected. There 
are two groups of emoticons that were labeled by majority 
of the participants as 
positive
or 
negative
(in the top and 
bottom of Fig. 1). Almost all participants agreed with little 
uncertainty that 
:D
and 
:)
are 
positive
and 
:-(
,
:'(
and
:(
are 
negative
. However, a large number of emoti-
cons was labeled with a mix of the three polarities as well 
as uncertain (in the middle of Fig. 1). For example, 
posi-
tive
has the most responses for 
:')
but 
negative
and 
None of the above or not sure
also have large shares of the 
responses, 
which 
reflects 
the 
complex 
and 
ambiguous 
nature of human emotion and language. It is also worth 
noting that even for some of the most common emoticons 
(e.g., 
:-)
and 
:p
) the interpretation of the emotions ex-
pressed is not perfectly consistent among the participants. 
Figure 1. Survey of emotion expressed by emoticons 
This survey of sentiment expressed by emoticons con-
firmed the hypothesis that some emoticons are reliable 
indicators of sentiment polarity while there is also large 
variation in how people express emotions through emoti-
cons and how they interpret the sentiment conveyed by 
emoticons. Therefore, extreme caution should be exer-
cised when utilizing the rich information in emoticons for 
better sentiment analysis. To further investigate the rela-
tionship between emoticons and sentiment, we carried out 
three more analyses to understand the contexts in which 
emoticons are used and the influence of emoticons on 
sentiment classification. 
In the next three analyses, we drilled into a subset of the 
Twitter data: one day of tweets from March 4, 2015 where 
276,207 emoticons were found from 45,169,774 tweets.

Clustering emoticons and words 
Interesting questions regarding the usage of emoticons 
are in what context they are usually used and what mean-
ing emoticons convey. In this analysis, we applied two 
machine learning algorithms to answer these questions. 
Firstly, we used a version of word2vec [17, 18], an algo-
rithm based on deep neural networks, to define the repre-
sentation of the words, including emoticons in the data 
set. Secondly, we use the k-means algorithm to cluster the 
words so we can understand the exact meaning of the 
emoticons through the words that appear in the same clus-
ter. Both of these machine learning algorithms help us 
define, explain and interpret emoticons in the context of 
Twitter 
data. 
Next, 
we 
describe 
the 
details 
about 
the 
word2vec and k-means algorithms, respectively. 
For this experiment, all the tokens with a frequency 
less than 50 were filtered out. The number of features that 
word2vec generates was determined based on the decay of 
the singular values of the resulted feature matrix. Since 
small singular values explain little variation of the data, 
we chose a threshold of approximately 0.001 for the sin-
gular values to set the number of features to 500 (Fig. 2). 
The feature matrix generated by word2vec was of the size 
4480 words by 500 features. For the k-means algorithm, 
we used k=50 following the rule in [19], in which the au-
thors argue that k approx sqrt(n/2) is a reasonable choice 
of k where n is the number of observations. 
Figure 2. Singular values of word2vec feature matrix 
Table 2 shows the emoticons in each cluster. Notice 
that clusters A, B, D and E include mostly positive emoti-
cons and cluster C includes emoticons in the negative 
group. An interesting observation is that the emoticon 
:|
, 
labeled as neutral by more than a half of the participants 
of the survey (Fig. 1), appears in the negative cluster C. 
This confirms that 
:|
conveys a negative sentiment to 
some degree. Table 3 shows some sample words in each 
of the clusters with emoticons. The words help us under-
stand the emoticons in the same clusters in terms of the 
sentiment they express. For example, 
:')
received almost 
similar numbers of positive and negative responses in the 
survey. However, the words in cluster C suggests that 
:')
appears to be used primarily in negative contexts. In 
summary, this analysis validates the idea that the emoti-
cons were often used in consistent contexts to help ex-
press sentiment and the sentiment expressed by emoticons 
agrees well with words around them. Detailed analysis of 
the content of the clusters would be of particular interest 
to socio-linguistics researchers.

Sentiment expression with vs. without emoticons 
To understand the degree of which emoticons were 
used to express sentiment, we carried out this analysis to 
compare the sentiment of a tweet before and after emoti-
cons are removed from the text. Such a comparison would 
reveal how much emoticons were relied on to express 
sentiment in a tweet. 
500 tweets were randomly selected from the tweets 
with emoticons from March 4, 2015. They were manually 
annotated with one of the three labels: 
positive sentiment
, 
negative sentiment
or 
other
. A tweet was labeled as 
posi-
tive
or 
negative
if the sentiment is clear from reading the 
text (including the emoticons). It was labeled as 
other
if it 
does not express any sentiment (
neutral
), expresses multi-
ple sentiments, or the sentiment is not clear. The same set 
of tweets was manually annotated again using the three 
labels after the emoticons were removed from the text. 
By comparing the changes in the labels, we can under-
stand how exactly emoticons help express sentiment in 
tweets. Table 4 shows the confusion matrix of the labels. 
In the original tweets, 343 and 101 out of 500 were identi-
fied as 
positive
and 
negative
, respectively. 56 are labeled 
as 
Other
. After removing the emoticons in the tweets, 
only 165 and 57 out of 500 were identified as 
positive
and 
negative
, respectively. Those are nearly half of the origi-
nal numbers. More than half of the tweets (278) fell into 
the 
other
category. This result suggests that in about a half 
of the cases emoticons were the only signal of sentiment 
and in the other half of the cases emoticons were facilitat-
ing the expression of sentiment. Therefore, emoticons are 
a crucial component (sometimes the only component) of 
sentiment expression in short microblog posts. It is ex-
tremely important for any sentiment analysis of such kind 
of text to take emoticons into account. Otherwise, the re-
call of the sentiment analysis may suffer because of miss-
ing a significant portion of the documents.

Classifying sentiment with vs. without emoticons 
The results from last analysis provided support for the 
importance of emoticons in sentiment expression. One 
may wonder if removing emoticons from text will actually 
hurt sentiment classification using machine learning algo-
rithms. To test this hypothesis, we trained two Naive 
Bayes classifiers using the bag-of-words model. The man-
ually annotated 500 tweets in subsection B were used as 
the training and test data. One classifier was trained and 
tested 
on 
the 
original 
tweets. 
Another 
classifiers 
was 
trained and tested on the same set of tweets with emoti-
cons removed. We used 5 fold cross-validation for the 
training and testing of both classifiers. Standard metrics 
including precision, recall, F1 and accuracy were used to 
evaluate the classifiers. 
Table 5 shows the metrics averaged over the five runs. 
Classifiers trained with the original tweets, which include 
the emoticons, are reasonably accurate giving the training 
data was only 400 samples. Classifiers trained on tweets 
with emoticons removed have much lower accuracy, pre-
cision and recall for the 
positive
and 
negative
classes. For 
the 
other
class, the models performed better in the with-
out-emoticon 
condition 
presumably 
because 
the 
other
class now contains more training samples. 
There could be two potential explanations for the dif-
ferences in precision and recall for 
positive
and 
negative
classes. Firstly, it could be that removing the emoticons 
was hurting the classifiers because less information was 
available to it. Secondly, it may be due to the fact that the 
positive
and 
negative
classes had less training samples in 
the without-emoticon condition. Although this experiment 
could be improved by annotating more samples, current 
results seem to support that argument that removing emot-
icons from text hurts the performance of machine learning 
classifiers as well.

In this paper, we have shown that emoticons are widely 
used by Twitter users. In particular, emoticons expressing 
positive sentiment, such as 
:)
and 
;)
, were the dominant 
majority on Twitter. A group of emoticons expressing 
negative sentiment was commonly used too, while many 
others were used relatively infrequently. This observation 
is indeed in line with the Zipf’s law of word frequencies 
[20]. We conducted a survey to understand the perception 
of sentiment polarity of the emoticons by human, which 
revealed that some emoticons are strong and reliable sig-
nals of sentiment polarity while many others inherited the 
complexity and ambiguity in human language and emo-
tion. We carried out three more analyses using one of day 
of the Twitter data and investigated the relationship be-
tween emoticons and sentiment expression on the popular 
social media. The first analysis illustrated the fact that 
emoticons are used consistently in similar contexts by 
demonstrating that emoticons and words expressing simi-
lar 
sentiment 
are 
grouped 
into 
same 
clusters. 
It 
also 
showed that the complex meaning conveyed by some of 
the emoticons, such as 
:| 
and
:')
, can be understood 
through the words that appeared in the same contexts. The 
second analysis, comparing sentiment of tweets with and 
without emoticons, provided direct evidence on the im-
portance of emoticons in expressing sentiment on social 
media. In nearly a half of the cases, emoticons were the 
only component in the text that expressed some positive 
or 
negative 
sentiment. 
When 
the 
emoticons 
were 
re-
moved, the sentiment of those tweets became neutral or 
unclear. In the last analysis, we assessed the impact of 
removing emoticons from text to machine learning classi-
fiers. We showed that the classifiers became less accurate 
when emoticons were removed with the caveat that the 
classifier was trained with less positive and negative sam-
ples. The results from the analyses together confirms the

arguments that: 1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable 
(and sometimes unique) signals of sentiment polarity and 
one should take advantage of them in any sentiment anal-
ysis; 2) a large group of the emoticons conveys compli-
cated sentiment hence they should be treated with extreme 
caution. In conclusion, this study directly examined the 
relationship 
between 
emoticons 
and 
sentiment 
polarity 
and provides important recommendations for developing 
future sentiment analysis algorithms and solutions. Some 
of the methods and results in this study may also be in-
formative for socio-linguistics researchers interested in 
emoticon usage and sentiment expression on social media. 
For future work, we plan to annotate a larger set of 
tweets to corroborate the results obtained in Section IV.B 
and IV.C.
