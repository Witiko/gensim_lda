Abstract 
We build an online social support model of self-care behavior for patients of stigmatized chronic 
diseases. 
We 
conceptualize 
three 
dimensions 
of 
informational 
support 
namely 
objective 
information, experiential information, and crowd consensus, and hypothesize their positive 
effect on self-care behavior. We conceptualize three dimensions of emotional support namely 
emotional tone, self-disclosure, and community involvement, and hypothesize their positive 
effect on self-care behavior. We also hypothesize how these dimensions interact with each other 
in 
promoting 
self-care 
behavior. 
Using 
data 
from 
31,132 
threads 
from 
an 
online 
health 
community for HIV patients, we test our hypotheses using Tobit regression. We find statistically 
significant support for our hypotheses, except for the interaction of experiential and objective 
information on self-care. Contrary to our hypotheses, we find that self-disclosure is negatively 
associated with self-care behavior. Our findings have important implications for management 
of stigmatized chronic diseases.

Introduction 
Advances in information technology, particularly social media has created a new avenue for providing and 
seeking online social support via the Internet. Patients who suffer from chronic diseases, disabilities, or

cancers find social media particularly useful as it enables them to seek relevant information and support 
from peers or experts to help them with their self-management of such long-term diseases (Merolli, Gray, 
and Martin-Sanchez 2013). On the other side, patients also provide social support to their peers via social 
media by sharing health-related information and their personal experiences about coping with and self-
care of their diseases. Recent studies have shown that 40 percent of those who sought health-related 
information on social media also shared their personal health experiences (Fox and Duggan 2013). A 
recent paper by Yan and Tan (2014) shows a positive effect of online support on patients’ mental health.
While the findings on beneficial health impacts of online social support looks promising, we identify three 
avenues for further advancing this stream of research. First, while the literature analyzes impact of online 
social support on mental and emotional states (Yan and Tan 2014), there is lack of research on the role of 
online social support in promoting self-care behavior of a chronic disease (Merolli, Gray, and Martin-
Sanchez 
2013). 
Although 
patient’s 
mental 
states 
such 
as 
good 
mood, 
and happiness 
are 
desirable 
outcomes, it doesn’t guarantee that they are performing actions required to manage their disease. Self-
care “involves the range of activities individuals undertake to enhance health, prevent disease, evaluate 
symptoms, and restore health (Cline and Worley 2006).” Since most chronic diseases are treated in home 
and outpatient settings, active patient participation is pivotal in managing the disease (Lorig et al. 2000). 
Thus, it is important to analyze self-care behavior as a key outcome of online social support in a chronic 
disease management.
Second, informational and emotional support, the two types of online social support analyzed in this 
literature, are analyzed in a very broad sense (Yan and Tan 2014). We argue that informational and 
emotional support could have important dimensions. For example, consider informational support. An 
online community member could provide informational support based on facts taken from Internet or 
based on personal experience. This argument suggests that informational support could be conceptualized 
as objective information and experiential information. However, the literature is yet to disaggregate 
informational and emotional support into nuanced dimensions. The qualitatively different dimensions, 
taken separately and simultaneously (i.e. the interaction with one another) could have differential impacts 
on a support seeker’s self-care behavior. Thus, it's important to conceptualize the fine-grained types of 
informational and emotional support.
Third, the literature is silent on the role of online social support in the management of stigmatized chronic 
diseases like HIV/AIDS. Patients suffering from these diseases face discrimination and hence have trouble 
disclosing their identity and establishing relationships (Parker and Aggleton 2003). This could have an 
impact on the quantity and quality of online social support provided, and the ensuing self-care behavior. 
So, 
it 
is important 
to 
analyze whether 
online 
social 
support will 
induce 
self-care 
behavior 
in the 
stigmatized chronic disease context. Having identified the gaps in the literature in this area, we ask the 
research question: Does online social support work in improving self-care behavior of a stigmatized 
chronic disease?
We address this research question in following ways and make three contributions to the literature. First, 
we theorize the impact of online social support with self-care behavior as the outcome of interest. By 
doing so we add to the online social support literature that has only studied emotional and mental health 
outcomes. Second, we conceptualize informational and emotional support into fine-grained distinct types 
and hypothesize their direct and interaction effects on self-care behavior. By doing so, we provide a 
nuanced understanding of online social support, and its various types. Third, we test our hypotheses using 
a massive dataset we constructed using data from an online health community for HIV patients. As a 
chronic disease and as a source of discrimination, HIV has societal and economic impacts (Piot et al. 
2001). Studies have reported poor adherence on self-care behavior ranging from 33% to 88% (Mills et al. 
2006). By analyzing HIV online community, we extend the research on the effects of online social support 
to stigmatized chronic disease context. 
The paper is structured as follows. We first provide the theoretical foundations, followed by hypotheses 
development, methods, results and discussion.
Theoretical Foundations 
Online Social Support and HIV Self-Care Behavior

Social Support
Social support refers to “information leading the subject to believe that he is cared for and loved, 
esteemed, and a member of a network of mutual obligations” (Cobb 1976). It is formed by the exchange of 
resources including verbal and nonverbal messages between two or more individuals (Pfeil 2009).
Social 
support as a strategy to cope with stress, and improve behavioral, psychological and physiological 
outcomes is well established in the public health, clinical psychology and sociology literatures. By either 
directly integrating the receiver of support into a social network or by indirectly affording interpersonal 
resources to the receiver, social support affects health outcomes (Cohen and Wills 1985; Kawachi and 
Berkman 2001). From a physiological angle, social support suppresses cortisol levels, increases calmness 
and decreases anxiety in response to stressful situations (Heinrichs et al. 2003). The social support-health 
outcomes link holds across contexts. For example, a study conducted among college students indicated 
that the students with lower level of social support were more likely to experience mental health problems 
(Hefner and Eisenberg 2009). Under the light of these findings in the offline context, we focus on the role 
of social support in the healthcare social media context.
Social Media and Social Support
Social media has facilitated an efficient and low-cost way of providing healthcare information, enabling 
patients to search information and advice regarding their specific health conditions and healthcare 
experience (Shuyler and Knight 2003), thus potentially increasing their healthcare outcomes (Xiao et al. 
2014). For example, patients use social media sites (SMS), both general-purpose SMS (e.g., Facebook, 
Twitter, etc.) and healthcare-focused SMS (e.g., WebMD, Yahoo! Health, MedicineNet, Biodigital Human, 
etc.) for gaining information and advice, providing social support to each other, exchanging information 
and experiences, and seeking suggestions and recommendations about healthcare (Antheunis, Tates, and 
Nieboer 2013; Maloney-Krichmar and Preece 2005). Some SMS also provide online forums and facilitate 
online health groups for people with similar health conditions (in particular, chronic diseases) so they can 
share their knowledge, personal experiences, and healthcare suggestions, as well as receive feedback and 
support from others which in turn can improve their psychological well-being, health-related decision-
making, and self-care behaviors to help them achieve better health outcomes (Cohen and Wills 1985; 
Greene et al. 2011). Online support groups on SMS contain a lot of health-related information contributed 
both by healthcare professionals (i.e., doctors, nurses, nutritionists, etc.) as well as patients. Prior 
research has shown that healthcare information and support received from patient peers may enhance 
evidence-based decision-making (Jadad et al. 2000), as information shared by patients on SMS is 
generally more associated with patients’ personal healthcare experiences. Therefore, our goal in this study 
is to focus on social support provided by patients to their peers suffering from the same chronic disease. 
The chronic disease of interest in our paper is HIV. Specifically, we focus on the role of social support in 
improving HIV patient self-care behavior. 
Types of Online Social Support 
Prior studies have generally categorized social support into different forms including 
informational 
support, emotional support, instrumental support, and companionship (Berkman et al. 2000; House 
1981). In the context of social support provided and received through social media with respect to 
healthcare issues, particularly in the context of chronic and difficult diseases, a recent paper by Yan and 
Tan 
(2014) 
distinguishes 
social 
support 
into 
informational 
support, 
emotional 
support 
and 
companionship. Their measure of informational supports subsumes both informational and experiential 
support. While there are other studies distinguishing online support (Coulson 2005; Bunde et al. 2007; 
Chuang and Yang 2012; Griffiths, Calear, and Banfield 2009; Meier et al. 2007; Rimer et al. 2005), in our 
paper, 
we 
consider 
two 
broad 
types 
of 
social 
support, 
informational 
and 
emotional 
support. 
We 
conceptualize that these two types of support have other sub dimensions. 
Informational Support 
We conceptualize objective information, experiential support and crowd consensus as three dimensions of 
informational support. Objective Information refers to receiving primarily factual information related to a 
Online Social Support and HIV Self-Care Behavior

4 
particular disease condition and its management (Coulson 2005). Objective information can be received 
by a patient suffering from a particular disease condition from a number of stakeholders in the healthcare 
ecosystem including healthcare professionals, family members and friends (who may do some research on 
a particular disease and share information with their loved ones), and other patients also suffering from 
that same disease. 
An online community member could provide informational support based on facts taken from internet or 
based 
on 
personal 
experience. 
So, 
we 
conceptualize 
experiential 
information 
as 
another 
type 
of 
informational support. Experiential information refers to receiving information about actual experiences 
and insights of and the strategies used by patients suffering from the same disease as the focal patient 
(Snyder and Pearse 2010). Obviously, this type of information can only be provided by other patients 
suffering from the same disease condition and not by other stakeholders in the healthcare system. This 
type of support can focus on either the experiences pertaining to the disease and its symptoms or on 
experiences pertaining to treatment and management of the disease. 
A community member could provide the needed information support, but such support would be of less 
impact if there is lack of coherence in the information provided by the community as a whole. So, we 
conceptualize crowd consensus as another type of informational support. Crowd consensus refers to the 
degree to which the opinions of the online community members converge (Chen and Straub 2015). 
Emotional Support 
We conceptualize emotional tone, community involvement and self-disclosure as three dimensions of 
emotional support. Emotional tone is essentially psychosocial support received by a patient suffering from 
a chronic disease condition that is provided by the giver with the intent to provide care, cheer, comfort, 
and relief to the patient to enable him/her to cope with the symptoms of his/her chronic disease and to 
engage effectively in the self-care of the disease condition (Bunde et al. 2007; Chuang and Yang 2012). 
This type of social support can also be provided by a number of stakeholders including healthcare 
professionals, family members and friends, and other patients also suffering from that same disease 
condition, although emotional tone from family and friends and other patients suffering from the same 
disease condition might be more effective. 
We conceptualize self-disclosure as another dimension of emotional support. Online health communities 
provide users affordances to set up digital profiles. Different communities allow different types of content 
such as text, pictures, video, audio, links and tags (Kane et al. 2012). For example, a patient can describe 
himself with a short biography, provide his age, gender, disease type, and medical history on his profile 
page. Certain communities make the disclosure of certain profile information mandatory. However, most 
sites leave the user to decide whether or not to reveal personally identifiable information. Based on the 
extent to which the user protected his privacy in the health community, other community members can 
visit the profile information and view the information disclosed in the profile page of a user. Moreover, 
whenever a user replies or posts a question in a thread, it is accompanied by some or all of the user’s 
profile information, which the other community members can view and make some impressions about the 
personality of the user. 
Disclosing profile information could reveal the identity of the user. In a stigmatized disease like HIV, 
users are more likely to not disclose their profile information. Because online communities make some 
profile information viewable along with the community member’s replies, a support seeker might buy into 
emotional tone if he knew more about the community member, his personality, and disease condition. So, 
we analyze the critical role of self-disclosure in enhancing the self-care behavior. We define self-disclosure 
as the extent to which the online community members replying to the support seeker’s thread disclose 
their personal identity in their digital profile. 
We conceptualize community involvement as a third dimension of emotional support because it denotes 
the intimacy and the emotional attachment the community members have towards the online health 
community. Community involvement is number of unique community members who reply to a support 
seeker in response to his question in a thread.

Self-Care Behavior
Extant 
research 
in 
the 
chronic 
disease 
management 
area 
identifies 
several 
predictors 
of 
self-care 
behaviors. A study of type-II diabetes adults showed that age, patient satisfaction with his/her physician-
patient relationship, personal stress and family context were found to be related to self-care behavior 
(Albright, Parchman, and Burge 2001). In another study of heart failure patients, those with higher 
education and severe symptoms were found to engage in self-care behavior (Rockwell and Riegel 2001). 
The literature in this area also investigates the role of social support as an important predictor of self-care 
behavior. A longitudinal study of adolescents with diabetes found that social support provided by their 
friends and family was positively related to self-care behavior (Skinner, John, and Hampson 2000). 
Similarly, Tang et al. (2008) found a positive social support-self-care behavior link in their study of 
African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes. DiMatteo (2004) conducted a meta-analysis to examine the 
relationship between social support and patient adherence to medical treatment, and a significant effect 
size was found to recognize this relationship. 
Research Model 
Having conceptualized online social support into its fine-grained dimensions, in the following section 
develop hypotheses relating these dimensions to self-care behavior in the context of stigmatized chronic 
diseases. Figure 1 illustrates our research model. 
Informational
Support and Self-Care Behavior
In our study, we conceptualize each thread as a “virtual group” formed to provide support to the support 
seeker. The support seeker is a patient who started a thread by posting some text that seeks support. The 
support providers are all community members who responded to this patient in this thread. We denote 
the support seeker as (i) and all support providers as (j). In the same vein, we conceptualize informational 
support as all the objective information a support seeker receives from community members in response 
to his question in a thread. We provide details of the variable operationalizations later in the methods 
section.
We posit that objective information will be positively related to support seeker’s self-care behavior. 
Information support provides facts that explain the underlying scientific mechanisms (Fan et al. 2013) 
including information about the etiology of the disease, information about medication and treatment, and 
information about coping with the disease and self-care. By virtue of providing knowledge of health risks 
and benefits, objective information makes the patients more informed. It helps patients understand the 
problems and the possible solutions associated with their disease. So, more objective information to the 
patient would suggest better understanding of their condition, and better actions for health improvement 
(McMullan 2006; Yan and Tan 2014). Prior research on online health communities for mental health 
shows a positive link between objective information and mental health outcomes (Yan and Tan 2014). 
Thus, we hypothesize that:
H1a: The higher the objective information provided by online community members (j’s) who respond to 
an individual member i, the more likely i will engage in self-care behaviors.

Figure 1. Research Model 
In our online health community context, we conceptualize experiential support as all the experiential 
information a support seeker receives from community members in response to his question in a thread. 
We posit that experiential information will be positively related to support seeker’s self-care behavior. 
Similar to our argument for H1a, we argue that support seekers who receive experiential information will 
be better informed. However, as opposed to objective information where the seeker received scientific 
information about the disease, experiential information provides first-hand information from a patient 
who is suffering from or who has successfully overcome a similar health condition (Snyder and Pearse 
2010). So, in addition to making the patients more informed, experiential information provides a model 
for the support seeker to follow. The social-cognitive theory argues that when people observe a model 
performing a behavior and effects of the behavior, they are better able to remember and replicate that 
behavior (Bandura 2004) . More the experiential information, better is the learning of the positive 
consequences of self-care from other patient’s personal experience, and better actions from the seeker to 
improve his health. Thus, we hypothesize that: 
H1b: The higher the experiential information provided by online community members (j’s) who respond 
to an individual member i, the more likely i will engage in self-care behaviors.
We conceptualize crowd consensus as the similarity in community member’s content i.e. similarity among 
all pairs of replies a support seeker receives from community members in response to his question in a 
thread. We posit that crowd consensus will be positively related to self-care behavior. The literature on 
social support obtained from groups argues that group consensus is an indicator of positive social 
environment in that group (Bliese and Britt 2001). Such groups are perceived by a support seeker to be 
well-functioning, and devoid of conflict and tension (Bliese and Britt 2001). The social influence theory 
argues that group consensus facilitates receipt of information (Kelman 2006). Similarly, social support 
seeker will be able to better assimilate and internalize the content shared by the community member in a 
thread where there is high crowd consensus (Chen and Straub 2015). The seekers in such a thread will be 
better informed to take health enhancing actions. Consequently, the self-care behavior elicited from 
thread with high crowd consensus will be higher than a thread with low crowd consensus. Thus, we 
hypothesize that: 
Online Social Support and HIV Self-Care Behavior

7 
H1c: The higher the crowd consensus among online community members (j’s) who respond to an 
individual member i, the more likely i will engage in self-care behaviors. 
Emotional Support and Self-Care Behavior
In our online health community context, we conceptualize emotional support as the emotional tone from 
all the replies a support seeker receives from community members in response to his question in a thread. 
We posit that emotional tone will be positively related to support seeker’s self-care behavior. There is 
abundant research delving on the importance and the impact of emotional management on the treatment 
of chronic diseases (Chesla et al. 2004; Chesla et al. 2003; Fisher et al. 2000). Patient morale is highly 
dependent on the emotional tone of the stakeholders, such as family, friend and similar others (Chesla et 
al. 2004). Emotional tone sends a signal to the support seeker that he is not alone and is taken care of 
(Yan and Tan 2014). Emotional tone sets the mood of a focal post, and a positive tone may shift members’ 
focus from anxiety about their condition to how to deal with it properly. Emotional tone in the online 
context is even more salient for our HIV context because of the stigma associated with the disease, 
difficulty in disclosing their disease and building relationships in the offline context. Knowing that other 
patients are successfully coping with HIV will provide assurance, and reinforcement, and reduce the 
attribution of personal blame (Bambina 2007; Weiss 1974; Wills 1985). Online community members 
develop intimate relationships and motivate each other to perform health enhancing actions (Lamberg 
2003). Prior research on online health communities for mental health shows that emotional support plays 
the most significant role in making patients move to a healthier state (Yan and Tan 2014). Thus, we 
hypothesize that: 
H2a: The higher the emotional tone in posts of online community members (j’s) who respond to an 
individual member I, the more likely I will engage in self-care behaviors
We posit that self-disclosure by online community members will be positively related to support seeker’s 
self-care behavior. Self-disclosure is closely related to concept of social presence. In an online community 
context, social presence is the extent to which an online community projects or increases the awareness of 
community members to the support seeker (Short, Williams, and Christie 1976). Threaded discussions 
lack 
the 
non-verbal 
cues 
available 
in 
face-to-face 
settings 
(Beck, 
Pahlke, 
and 
Seebach 
2014). 
Self-
disclosure through profile display feature increases the social presence of online community members. 
Knowing that they are identifiable, community members become accountable(Vance, Lowry, and Eggett 
2015), eventually increasing the quality of knowledge shared by them (Beck, Pahlke, and Seebach 2014). 
Research shows that in the context of online threaded learning forums, greater social presence leads to 
sustained communication and a high quality online discourse, subsequently improving student’s learning 
outcomes. On the other hand, greater anonymity of members in computer-mediated groups reduced the 
group productivity and quality (Lowry et al. 2009). Moreover, high self-disclosure from community 
members can persuade HIV patients to downplay the stigma associated with the disease and embrace self-
care behavior with an open mind. The above arguments suggest that threads with high self-disclosure can 
better persuade support seekers in self-care behavior than threads with low self-disclosure. Thus, we 
hypothesize that: 
H2b: The higher the self-disclosure by online community members (j’s) who respond to an individual 
member i, the more likely i will engage in self-care behaviors.
We also argue that community involvement will be positively related to self-care behavior. Community 
involvement is closely related to the companionship one would typically get in with offline friends through 
chatting, group meetings, and other social activities (Yan and Tan 2014). It also pertains to what the social 
presence theory terms as the feeling of warmth, and the human contact, a support seeker senses from the 
online 
community 
(Short, 
Williams, 
and 
Christie 
1976). 
The 
companionship 
aspect 
of 
community 
involvement makes the support seeker believe that there are community members who enjoy the seeker’s 
presence (Yan and Tan 2014). Consequently, support seekers believe that they are more than just an 
individual and hence get integrated into the threaded discussion (Yan and Tan 2014). Consequently, the 
support provided by the community members act as a “talk therapy” to motivate them to perform self-
care behaviors (Yan and Tan 2014). By an enhanced sense of human contact, the community members act

8 
as a form of social capital providing the support needed to perform health enhancing actions (Tseng, 
Huang, and Teng 2015). When support seekers obtain a better sense of human contact, they feel higher 
social presence, and can hence trust the community members and alleviate the uncertainty associated 
with the support provided by them (Beck, Pahlke, and Seebach 2014; Lu, Fan, and Zhou 2016) . Thus, we 
hypothesize that:
H2c: The higher the involvement of online community members (j’s) who respond to an individual 
member i, the more likely i will engage in self-care behaviors.
Moderators of Objective Information
Objective informational is more influential if it is augmented with personal experience. In such situations, 
not only do the support seekers have information regarding the disease and its management through self-
care behavior, they also have evidence to validate from personal experiences of community members. 
Experiential information adds validity and personal touch to the objective information. Yan and Tan 
(2014) used a broader social support construct measuring both information and experiential support, and 
found significant health outcomes in online communities. So, we argue that informational support in a 
thread with high experiential support will influence a support seeker’s self-care behavior better than a 
thread where there is low informational support. Thus, we hypothesize that: 
H3a. The higher the experiential information provided by online community members (j’s) who respond 
to an individual member i, the stronger will be the association between the objective information 
provided by j’s to i and the self-care behaviors of i.
As argued in H1a, 
objective information promotes self-care behavior by making the 
patient 
better 
informed. On the other hand, online health communities can also spread misinformation
(Venkatesan et 
al. 2013). There is no mechanism to verify the truthfulness, objectivity and correctness of online health 
information 
(Pourmand 
and 
Sikka 
2011). 
Not 
all 
online 
communities 
are 
moderated 
by 
health 
professionals or automated to detect irrelevant information. Given this potential for misinformation, 
support seekers are uncertain about the quality of social support received. Festinger (1954) in his social 
comparison theory argues that when people lack objective benchmarks to rate conflicting information, 
they look for shared patterns in the information. Crowd consensus reduces uncertainty on other’s 
judgement, a major deterrent to social influence(Deutsch and Gerard 1955). Prior research shows that 
crowd consensus enhances the perceived credibility of the social support in online health communities 
(Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan 2013). However, when there is no crowd consensus the uncertainty over the 
information remains. Consequently, information support in a thread with high crowd consensus will 
influence a support seeker’s self-care behavior better than a thread where there is low crowd consensus 
(Chen and Straub 2015). Thus, we hypothesize that: 
H3b: The higher the consensus in the information provided by online community members (j’s) who 
respond 
to 
an 
individual 
member 
i, 
the 
stronger 
will 
be 
the 
association 
between 
the 
objective 
information provided by j’s to i and the self-care behaviors of i.
Moderators of Emotional Tone 
In H2b and H2c, we argued that threads with high self-disclosure and community involvement are more 
influential in bringing about self-care behavior by creating a sense of social presence and bringing about 
social space. In this section, we argue that these two variables can amplify the impact of emotional tone on 
self-care behavior. The social presence theory argues that media high on social presence is best suited for 
conveying affective information (Kreijns, Kirschner, and Jochems 2003). By this logic, high disclosure 
threads make the community members more salient for the support seeker, and hence would amplify the 
influence of emotional support provided by them. Thus, we hypothesize that: 
H4a. The higher the self-disclosure by online community members (j’s) who respond to an individual 
member i, the stronger will be the association between the emotional tone in posts of j’s and the self-care 
behaviors of i.

Research shows that perceived social presence increases the trust in the message source, usefulness of the 
message, and comfort in processing the affective cues (Cyr et al. 2007). So, perception of social presence 
in threads with high community involvement, makes support seekers more receptive to the emotional 
tone 
of 
community 
members. 
Users 
would 
view 
the 
thread 
as 
a 
warm, 
sociable, 
personal 
virtual 
counselling team (Short, Williams, and Christie 1976). In sum, the emotional tone and the associated care, 
cheer, comfort, and relief provided by such threads will better motivate the support seeker to perform 
health enhancing actions. Thus, we hypothesize that:
H4b. The higher the involvement of online community members (j’s) who respond to an individual 
member i, the stronger will be the association between the emotional tone in posts of j’s and the self-care 
behaviors of i.

The dataset used in this research was constructed from an online health community – POZ, which was 
founded to facilitate information sharing that can help improve the lives of patients suffering from HIV. 
POZ serves its community members with daily news, treatment updates, personal profiles, videos, blogs, 
discussion 
forums 
and 
an 
extensive 
online 
social 
network 
that 
includes 
150,000 
members. 
POZ’s 
discussion forums are one of the most popular and active online HIV/AIDS support forums on the 
internet with an outreach that includes 70 percent of the HIV positive people living in the US. The forum 
supports more than 30,000 registered members and 
20 forums organized by criteria such as HIV 
prevention and testing, disease stages ranging from newly diagnosed to long term survivors, treatments 
and nutrition (e.g., antiretroviral therapy (ART), Lipodystrophy & metabolic problems), and demographic 
characteristics (e.g., positive Women). In these forums, members ask questions, share stories, and read 
posts from other community members. 
We collected data on posts, users and their profiles from POZ discussion boards from May 2006 to March 
2017. During this period, there were a total of 15,661 unique users who wrote 370,364 posts belonging to 
31,132 discussion threads. The median number of posts in a thread was 6 and the mean was 11. 49% of 
registered members did not actively participate in the forum discussions by posting a message. The 
median lifespan of a thread was 1 day and the mean was 45 days. Each thread received a median of 4 
replies and a mean of 8 replies from community members. 
Measures 
We used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program (Pennebaker et al. 2015), a popular 
linguistic analysis tool. LIWC calculates the frequency with which words in a text match each of 93 LIWC 
dictionaries including psychological constructs (e.g., positive emotion), personal concerns (e.g., money, 
death), social words (e.g., family, friends), biological processes (e.g., health, sexuality), etc. We used LIWC 
2015 for analyzing the texts posted by the patients on the discussion forums. LIWC 2015 also allows us to 
define a custom dictionary for analyzing text, a feature that we will be using for the calculation of self-care 
behavior score. Prior research demonstrated a moderate correlation between ratings assigned by a human 
rater and LIWC Scores (Alpers et al. 2005). This tool has been used in the online health community 
context as well. Wang, Kraut, and Levine (2012) used selected dictionaries from LIWC dictionaries to 
investigate the effects of emotional and informational support on commitment of patients to online health 
support groups. 
In this study, we conduct the analysis at the thread level. We concatenated all posts of community 
members (j) and support seeker (i) separately and use LIWC to analyze these texts. By focusing on the 
thread level, we can capture all social support a support seeker received from community members in 
response to his question. We can model the self-care behavior as a function of social support by capturing 
the subsequent expression self-care by the support seeker and regressing it on social support received

10 
from the community members. Using a thread-level ensures that the support seeker (i) indeed solicited 
and received social support from the community members (j). 
Main Variables 
Self-Care Behavior (i): To measure self-care behavior we collect all the subsequent responses by the 
support seeker (i) after he/she initiated a thread. We measure self-care behavior by a score calculated 
using both, the LIWC dictionary and a custom dictionary we created. For LIWC dictionary, we picked the 
“achievement” and “reward” subsets of the broader “core drives and needs” dimension because self-care 
behavior is typically accompanied by expressions of achievement and reward. For the custom dictionary, 
we capture other words that reflect self-care behavior. We extract important terms from the popular 
“AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) -adherence baseline questionnaire” and “ACTG-adherence follow-up 
questionnaire” (Chesney et al. 2000) used by hospitals for following up on patients' HIV self-care 
behavior. We analyze the text using Python. We break the sentences into words and then remove stop 
words using list provided by Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). After performing a Term Frequency - 
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis on the obtained word list, we pick the seed words that are 
most relevant to self-care behavior. We then train a word embedding model (Mikolov et al. 2013) on the 
collected text using Gensim (Rehurek and Sojka 2010). This method generates a vector space model 
extremely specific to our context of HIV/AIDS. In this high dimensional space, vectors representing 
semantically similar words have less Euclidian distance than other words in the vocabulary. Using the 
seed words obtained above, we obtain semantically similar words which reflect self-care behavior of 
patients 
in 
the 
online 
community. 
The 
vocabulary 
generated 
is used 
to 
construct 
a 
custom 
LIWC 
dictionary. Finally, we sum up the self-care behavior score obtained from both, LIWC and the custom 
dictionaries. 
There is a possibility that (i) expressed self-care behavior but was complaining about it. In order to 
account for this, we calculated the net emotional score for i’s responses in the thread. This score was used 
as a threshold to decide whether the self-care behavior expressed was a complaint about his self-care 
behavior or actual self-care behavior to manage the disease. The LIWC negative emotion score was 
subtracted from the positive emotional score to calculate the net emotional score. When the net score was 
positive, we used the self-care behavior score as it is. If this number is negative, the self-care behavior was 
expressed in a negative emotional environment, meaning that the individual is probably not engaged in 
self-care behavior but complaining about it. In this case, we will return the score of self-care behavior to 
zero. Out of the 31132 threads, 13683 threads had an expression of self-care behavior. 
There is also a possibility that the initiator of the thread is another stakeholder (such as caregiver or a 
doctor) other than the patient, and the self-care behavior expressed is not patient-centric. This online 
health community doesn’t provide the HIV status of the support seeker. To verify the initiator of the 
threads in this online community, we randomly picked 90 threads and went through the posts by support 
seeker. We found that all 90 threads were initiated by HIV patients. Therefore, we believe that the threads 
in this community are by and large initiated by HIV patients. 
There are several self-care behaviors for HIV, such as exercising, taking medicines, taking vitamins, etc. 
The choice of self-care behavior should depend on patient’s condition and symptom. The time-period for a 
self-care behavior to take effect after receiving support varies. There is a possibility that the expressed 
self-care is an intention, and not a behavior. To address this problem, we use LIWC to measure the “past 
focus”, “present focus” and “future focus” of all posts by support seeker (i), and obtained the means (1.09, 
9.41, 3.02) and medians (0.66, 10.73, 2.74) for future, present and past focus respectively. The mean and 
median of “present focus” is much larger than those of “future focus” and “past focus”. We performed a 
frequency distribution analysis for each foci, which suggested that majority of the data points have future 
focus close to 0, whereas present focus and past focus are a little more spread out. Therefore, we argue 
that the self-care we captured manifests as a behavior and not as an intention. 
Objective Information (j) includes the factual information of disease and treatment management. There 
are two dimensions in LIWC that would cover this type of information: “biological processes”, which 
includes 
sub 
dimensions’ 
body, health/illness, 
sexuality, 
ingesting 
and 
“cognitive 
processes”, 
which 
includes sub dimensions’ insight, cause, discrepancies, tentativeness, certainty, and differentiation. Thus, 
Online Social Support and HIV Self-Care Behavior

11 
we calculated the score for objective information by summing up the LIWC score on biological processes 
and cognitive processes obtained by analyzing the concatenating posts of community members (j) in the 
focal thread. 
Experiential Information (j) focuses on the members’ stories and anecdote from the past. Therefore, we 
use the LIWC score on “past focus” under the dimension of “time orientation” obtained by analyzing the 
concatenating posts of community members (j) in the focal thread. 
Crowd Consensus (j): It is a metric which reflects a degree of agreement between the social support 
provided by members (j) in a thread. To calculate this, we consider all the replies posted by all members (j) 
(except creator of thread) on a given thread. We generate a vector representation for each reply using 
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting. We use cosine similarity to measure 
the similarity of content between a pair of replies by community members. For every thread, we calculate 
similarity scores for every pair of replies and average all the scores to define crowd consensus for a 
thread. 
Emotional Tone (j) was captured by the LIWC score on “emotional Tone” obtained by analyzing the 
concatenating posts of community members (j) in the focal thread. 
Self-Disclosure (j): Self-disclosure measures the willingness of community members (j) to share personal 
information. Based on the information collected by this online community, we accounted for disclosure of 
age, gender and location, with each being a binary metric (0 - not shared, 1 - shared) contributing to the 
self-disclosure score. For each user, we aggregate the three disclosure scores to form the self-disclosure 
score for j (an integer value between 0 and 3). For each thread, we average the self-disclosure scores of all 
community members (j) of the thread to generate a self-disclosure score for a thread. 
Community 
Involvement 
(j): 
we 
measure 
community 
involvement 
using 
the 
number 
of 
posts 
by 
community members(j) in a thread. 
Control variables 
The characteristics of the support seeker (i) and thread may have impacts on the engagement of self-care 
behaviors. We have six control variables that capture the support seeker’s individual characteristics: 1. 
Question rarity: Commonness of questions asked by a support seeker can impact the type of replies 
elicited by the support provider. To address this potential issue, we controlled for the rarity of questions. 
We use latent semantic analysis topic modelling after pruning stopwords to identify N-topics and for 
representing each question as a point in an N-dimensional space. We used N=100 in our analysis. We 
cluster different questions together based on their Euclidean distance using K-means clustering. The most 
dense cluster will have high number of questions with similar topics –this set is our 'most frequently 
asked questions'. We have used K=5, clustering all 31132 questions into 5 clusters. We further made these 
clusters denser by combining them – we named cluster 1 (also our reference group) as “most frequently 
asked questions” with 17435 questions, the combined cluster 2 and 3 as “less frequently asked questions” 
with 10369 questions, and the combined cluster 4 and 5 as “least frequently asked questions” with 3307 
questions. 2. Forum name: The dataset was crawled from 6 forums of this online community, namely 
“Living With HIV”, “Just Detected”, “Treatments and Side effects”, “Nutrition”, “Research News” and 
“Mental Health”. Each forum focused on a specific HIV problem. Patients who are concerned about a 
certain problem will join and post a thread in the corresponding forum. We added categorical dummy 
control variables indicating the forum to which the thread belongs to. We added one control variable each 
for the different forum names. We made the forum “Research News” as the reference group in our model. 
By adding these categorical variables we address the impact of support types sought on the reply elicited 
from a support provider. 3. Emotional Tone (i) is measured by the LIWC score on “emotional tone” 
obtained by analyzing the concatenating posts of support seeker (i) in the focal thread. This measure can 
act as a proxy for the support seeker’s sickness. 4. Self-Disclosure (i): similar to the self-disclosure of 
community member (j), i’s self-disclosure was calculated by adding the value of binary disclosure metric 
for age, gender and location (0-not shared, 1-shared). This score will demonstrate the openness of support 
seeker and the extent to which he trusts this community. 5. Degree Centrality (i): is a social network 
measure gauging the centrality of the support seeker in the reply network. It is measured by summing up 
Online Social Support and HIV Self-Care Behavior

12 
the in-degree and out-degree of the support seeker (Freeman 1978). 6. Creator Involvement (i) is the 
number of posts by support seeker in the thread (initiated by him). The level of involvement would be able 
to reflect the support seeker’s perceived importance of the thread, which in turn could be related to the 
engagement of self-care behavior. 7. Word Count of First Post (i): The length of the post initiated by the 
support seeker is another variable reflecting the involvement of the creator. This variable was measured 
by the number of words in the first post by support seeker (i). 
In addition, we have two variables controlling for characteristics of thread: 1. Previous-Interaction (i,j): 
We quantify the familiarity between the support seeker (i) of a thread and the members (j1, j2, j3… jn) 
offering social support within this thread. Previous interaction is measured by the average number of 
interactions between the i and js, prior to the creation of this thread. For example, we trace the number of 
interactions between i and j1, i and j2…, i and jn prior to focal thread respectively, and average these 
numbers to get the previous interaction for the entire thread. 2. Thread Duration is calculated by the 
difference between the date of creation of thread to the date of last posts (either by i or j). We can get a 
sense of the level of activity of the focal thread through this variable. 
Analysis 
We choose the estimation method based on the nature of our dependent variable. We capture self-care 
behavior based the support seeker’s expression of the same in his replies in a thread. However, non-
expression of self-care behavior doesn’t imply that the support seeker did not engage in self-care behavior. 
Therefore, value of zero on self-care behavior score could imply either they engaged in self-care behavior 
and did not express or they did not engage in self-care behavior. Therefore, there is an issue of left-
censoring in our dependent variable. In order to address this, we perform Tobit regression to model our 
dependent 
variable. 
In 
addition, 
a 
support 
seeker 
(i) 
could 
create 
multiple 
threads 
in 
this 
online 
community. So, we account for the fixed effects of the support seeker in our model by clustering across i. 
To overcome the potential issue of multicollinearity among independent variables, we standardize all 
independent variables, i.e. transform the value to z-score. We use STATA 14 to estimate our model. Our 
model equation is provided below. 
Results 
Table 1 reports the means, standard deviations and correlations for all variables. The correlations provide 
sense of relationship among the constructs. For instance, self-care behavior (i) was positively correlated to 
experiential information (j), crowd consensus (j), emotional tone (j), and community involvement (j).

Table 1. Table Correlation (Continued)
The results of Tobit regression are presented in Table 2. Our Tobit analyses proceeds by first introducing 
our control variables, followed by the independent variables and the interaction terms in a hierarchical 
way. Model 1 is the baseline model, with control variables. Model 2 introduces the direct effects of our 
independent variables. Model 3 introduces the interaction terms. 
H1a, H1b, and H1c stated that the self-care behavior (i) is positively associated with objective Information 
(j), experiential information (j), and crowd consensus (j), respectively. Our results in table 2 shows 
support for these hypotheses. Objective information (j) (β = 0.10, p < .05), experiential information (j) (β 
= 0.15, p < .001), and 
crowd consensus (j) (β = 0.34, p < .001) 
were positively and statistically 
significantly 
associated with 
self-care 
behavior 
(i). 
H2a, 
H2b, 
and H2c hypothesized that 
self-care 
behavior (i) is positively related to emotional tone (j), self-disclosure (j), and community involvement (j), 
respectively. Our results in table 2 shows support for H2a, and H2c. For H2b, we found a significant effect 
in the opposite direction. Emotional tone (j) (β = 0.68, p < .001) and community involvement (j) (β = 0.35, 
p 
< 
.001) 
were 
positively 
and 
significantly 
related 
to 
self-care 
behavior. 
But, 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
hypothesized positive effect, self-disclosure (j) (β = -0.08, p < .05) was significantly negatively related to 
self-care behavior. 
In H3a, H3b, we hypothesized that the experiential information (j) and crowd consensus (j) will amplify 
the positive effect of objective information (j) on self-care behavior (i), respectively. While our results 
show support for H3b: objective information (j) X crowd consensus (j) (β = 0.07, p < .01), we did not find 
statistically significant interaction effect between experiential information (j) and objective information 
(j). H4a and H4b proposed that self-disclosure (j) and community involvement (j), will amplify the 
positive association between emotional tone (j) and self-care behavior (i), respectively. Our results show 
support for these hypotheses. As hypothesized, emotional tone (j) significantly interacted with the self-
disclosure (j) (β = 0.11, p < .001) and community involvement (j) (β = 0.47, p < .001). In sum, eight out of 
the ten hypotheses were supported.

Robustness Check 
We conducted a variety of robustness checks to ascertain that our core results are stable across alternative 
model specifications and variable operationalization. Table 2 reports the results of three robustness 
checks we performed. One, we estimate our model using OLS (model 4). Two, we estimate a tobit model 
with number of distinct community members (j) as a proxy for community involvement (j) (model 5). 
Three, we estimate a tobit model by operationalizing self-disclosure (j) by using a binary variable, i.e. code 
all non-zero self-disclosure values as one (model 6). Such a coding denotes self-disclosure based on 
occurrence as opposed to levels 
that captures the degree. We find the results are robust to these 
alternative model specifications and variables operationalizations.

Limitations and Future Directions 
We acknowledge the limitations of this study and identify opportunities for future research. First, though 
we consider experiential information and objective information as separate dimensions of informational 
support, we submit that there is an overlap between these two variables. For example, a community 
member can provide objective information based on his experience. Future work may apply supervised 
machine learning techniques to better differentiate objective information and experiential information. 
Second, as described in the previous section, we are only able to capture the self-care behavior of those 
who expressed it in their threads. We give a zero to both, those may have performed self-care behavior but 
did not report, and those who did not actually perform self-care behavior. This implies a possible 
measurement issue with our dependent variable. Though we use a Tobit model to account for the left-
censoring, future studies may perform two-stage least squares model with instrumental variables that 
predict a support giver’s likelihood of disclosing their self-care behavior. 
Discussion 
Our study and its findings makes three contributions to the online social support literature. First, we 
theorize and test the influence of online social support with self-care behavior as the outcome of interest. 
Our model and findings on the influence of online social support on self-care behavior addresses the gap 
in this literature which has primarily addressed mental and physical health outcomes (Yan and Tan 2014; 
Chen and Straub 2015), and seldom addressed the self-care behaviors. Reports of low self-care behaviors 
in HIV patients attest the notion: medical answers to the self-care puzzle are inadequate (Mills et al. 
2006). We need behavioral solutions as well. In light of these alarming numbers, our study makes a 
valuable contribution. Moreover, though there is ample evidence about the beneficial self-care impacts of 
social support in an offline context, there is a paucity of literature about the health behavior impacts of 
social support received from other patients through social media in the management of chronic disease 
(Gielen et al. 2001). Our study fills this gap. 
Second, 
we 
conceptualize 
the 
fine-grained 
types 
of 
informational 
and 
emotional 
support. 
For 
informational support, we 
disaggregate it 
into three dimensions: objective information, experiential 
information and crowd consensus. Accordingly, we hypothesized that these three variables are positively 
associated with self-care behavior and these three hypotheses were supported by our results. In addition, 
we hypothesized that experiential information and crowd consensus amplify the association between 
objective information and self-care behavior, respectively. Our results supported the interaction effect of 
crowd consensus in accordance with prior research (Chen and Straub 2015). However, the interaction 
effect of experiential support was not significant. We also disaggregate emotional support into three 
dimensions: emotional tone, self-disclosure and community involvement. 
We hypothesize that 
each 
dimension is positively associated with self-care behavior. While the hypotheses on emotional tone and 
community were supported, our results indicate that there is a significantly negative association between 
self-disclosure and self-care behavior. One of the possible explanations for this result could be distraction 
caused by the self-disclosure of community members (Brooks 2015). We also hypothesized that self-
disclosure and community involvement would amplify the association between emotional tone and self-
care behavior, respectively. Both of the hypotheses were supported by our results. Our model and results 
fills the gaps in the online social support literature where informational and emotional support have been 
looked very broadly. Third, we analyzed whether online social support will have impact on self-care 
behavior in the context of stigmatized chronic disease, which is HIV in this study. We identify self-
disclosure, a stigmatized disease related variable and include it in our model. Contrary to prediction of 
existing theories (Vance, Lowry, and Eggett 2015), our results showed that self-disclosure is negatively 
associated with self-care behavior, which is an insightful finding. By doing so, we could extend the online 
social support model of self-care behavior to the context of stigmatized chronic disease.
