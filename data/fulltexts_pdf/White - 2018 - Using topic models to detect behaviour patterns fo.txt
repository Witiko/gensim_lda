Abstract
Healthcare systems worldwide are facing growing demands on their resources due to
an ageing population and increase in prevalence of chronic diseases.
Innovative resi-
dential healthcare monitoring systems, using a variety of sensors are being developed
to help address these needs.
Interpreting the vast wealth of
data generated is key
to fully exploiting the benefits offered by a monitoring system.
This thesis presents
the application of topic models,
a machine learning algorithm,
to detect behaviour
patterns in different types of data produced by a monitoring system.
Latent Dirichlet
Allocation was applied to real
world activity data with corresponding ground truth
labels of
daily routines.
The results from an existing dataset and a novel
dataset
collected using a custom mobile phone app,
demonstrated that the patterns found
are equivalent of
routines.
Long term monitoring can identify changes that could
indicate an alteration in health status.
Dynamic topic models were applied to simu-
lated long term activity datasets to detect changes in the structure of daily routines.
It was shown that the changes occurring in the simulated data can successfully be
detected.
This result suggests potential for dynamic topic models to identify changes
in routines that could aid early diagnosis of chronic diseases.
Furthermore,
chronic
conditions,
such as diabetes and obesity,
are related to quality of diet.
Current re-
search findings on the association between eating behaviours,
especially snacking,
and the impact on diet quality and health are often conflicting.
One problem is the
lack of
consistent definitions for different types of
eating event.
The novel
appli-
cation of
Latent Dirichlet Allocation to three nutrition datasets is described.
The
results demonstrated that combinations of food groups representative of eating event
types can be detected.
Moreover, labels assigned to these combinations showed good
agreement with alternative methods for labelling eating event types.
Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the funding for this PhD by the University of Reading
Research Endowment Trust Fund (RETF), without this scholarship it would not have
been possible to conduct this research.
In addition, this PhD was associated with the
SPHERE IRC project funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council (EPSRC), Grant EP/K031910/1.
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt thanks to my PhD super-
visors, Professor William Harwin and Professor William Holderbaum, for all of their
support and guidance throughout my research.
A special
mention goes to William
Harwin for believing in my potential
and encouraging me along the academic path
since the second year of my undergraduate degree.
Thank you for all
your inspira-
tional and interesting chats.
Many thanks also go to my nutritionist collaborators, Dr
Laura Johnson from the University of Bristol and Dr Eileen Gibney from University
College Dublin.
I appreciate the time you took to share your knowledge,
ideas and
data with me.
It is always refreshing to see things from an alternative point of view
and work across disciplines to discover innovative ways of solving problems.
I would like to thank all the members of the SPHERE project team, past and present
for your support, friendship, collaboration and intellectual stimulation.
It was great
to be part of a big project family, in particular the chance to share ideas in workshops
and on away days,
especially with those from other disciplines.
Special
thanks to
everyone in the Reading office for keeping me going over the last few years, it wouldn’t
have been the same without you.
I would also like to thank everyone in the School
of Systems Engineering (sadly no more!), especially Dr Hwang, Dr Janko, Dr Cave-
Ayland, Mr Salmon, Dr Zoulias, Ms Fannon, Mr Laird, Dr Tse, Ms Cheung and Mr
Gould, for all your friendship, inspiration and pearls of wisdom over the years, since
starting my first degree.
I would never have got this far without you all!

The academic road can be a rocky one and the summit sometimes dips out of sight;
many thanks go to all my mountaineering and climbing friends.
Our journeys along
real rocky paths to summits with beautiful views (when not covered in cloud!) pro-
vide much needed respite from a computer screen and blow the cobwebs away to
make space for fresh ideas and solutions.
Thank you for listening and sharing these
moments with me.
An extra thank you to Ania, Pete (and Merlin) for sharing your
first house with me and giving me a wonderful
home to live in.
Many thanks also
go to the other rocks in my life, both past and present, for all the much needed fun,
laughter and long chats.
You know who you are, thanks!!
You don’t easily get far in life without the dedication and support of a family, in all
shapes and sizes,
financially,
emotionally and much more!
Over the course of
this
PhD I’ve had the great joy of two new additions in the form of my gorgeous niece and
nephew, such breaths of fresh air.
I love to watch you grow and learn.
My grandpa
has challenged and inspired me with his stories and questions during many visits in
hospitals and nursing homes.
My mum and dad are always there,
no matter what
or when,
even if
it means a road trip down the Florida Keys after presenting at a
conference ;)
Last,
but by no means least,
I’d like to thank my fianc´e,
Vinny.
Who knows,
if
it
wasn’t for my PhD I might not have taken an interest in your wearable device and
we wouldn’t be where we are today!
You might not have been there since the start
but your input has been invaluable.
Thank you for all your love, patience and advice,
especially for keeping me going through the write up.
This is just the start,
I can’t
wait for the rest of our adventures together :)

Mathematical Notation
Within the machine learning community a variety of different mathematical notations
are often used to represent the same concept.
For clarification an explanation of the
notation used in this thesis is given.
~x
= (
x
1

2
, . . . , x
K
) denotes a vector of K elements and is often shortened
to
~x
to increase readability.
This notation is used to denote a discrete
multinomial variable that can take one of K possible mutually exclusive
states.
In this case,
one element
x
k
will
equal
1 and all
other elements
will equal 0.
x
1:

Introduction
There is a demand from the public,
in countries across the globe,
for affordable
access to high quality health care [1].
This goal poses many unprecedented challenges
that must be tackled.
Several
new approaches and initiatives are being considered
in an effort to address these needs,
including the role of
technology in healthcare
systems [2,3].
In particular, empowering people to monitor their health and well-being
at home is gaining increasing interest from interdisciplinary research communities [4].
Residential healthcare monitoring systems can generate a vast amount of data from
a variety of
sensors.
Interpreting this data is key to fully exploiting the benefits
offered by a monitoring system.
Data fusion and machine learning techniques can be
employed to detect patterns and provide useful information to the end users.
This thesis explores high level data fusion for healthcare monitoring systems.
The
main focus is on the use of the machine learning algorithm, topic models, originally
developed by the text processing community.
The application of
topic models to
detect behaviour patterns from different types of
data produced by a residential
monitoring system is presented and the results are analysed and discussed.
1.1
Motivation
The UK’s National
Health Service (NHS) is facing ever growing demands on its
resources in order to continue to be able to provide world class health care.
One key
factor is the demographic change that is occurring.
It is predicted that approximately
26% of the UK population will
be aged 65 or over by 2061,
compared with 17% in
2012,
leading to a rise in the proportion of
gross domestic product (GDP) that is
spent on health and social
care [5].
In particular,
it is projected that by 2065 age-
1
1.1.
Motivation
related spending on health and long-term care will
increase to 10.2% of GDP from
an estimated 8.4% in 2015 [6].
An expansion in morbidity is another contributing
factor.
Although there may be an increase in the average healthy life expectancy it
is likely that the absolute amount of time spent in poor health and associated costs
will still increase overall [5].
Another critical
factor is the increase in prevalence of chronic diseases and con-
ditions,
such as depression,
diabetes and heart failure.
For example,
approximately
4% of
the UK population have diabetes and the treatment for this requires about
10% of the NHS budget [7].
Although this increase is in part related to the demo-
graphic change,
it is also due to lifestyle and environmental
changes,
such as diet
and nutrition intake [8].
In fact,
for current generations,
chronic diseases and the
associated disabilities could well
have a larger impact on healthcare systems than
age-specific disabilities [9].
This is an issue that resonates worldwide, as highlighted
by the Director General of the World Health Organisation in the 2010 World Health
Report [1].
Over the past 25 years,
the global
burden of neurological
disorders,
in-
cluding dementia, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy, has substantially increased.
This
group is the leading cause of disability, with stroke being the largest contributor [10].
Many chronic diseases are related to physical
activity (PA) levels and these can
be a relevant indicator of a person’s health, particularly for COPD patients [11, 12].
Low levels of PA and corresponding energy expenditure are associated with greater
risk of
hospital
admission and mortality.
Rehabilitation programs for pulmonary
diseases aim to increase and maintain PA levels over time, including when a patient
returns to their home after discharge [12].
Research has also shown that PA levels
are inversely related to cardio-metabolic risk factors in youth [13].
Furthermore,
PA is important for retaining the ability to conduct activities of daily living (ADL),
however the recommended guideline levels of PA are often not met by older adults [14].
Monitoring a person’s ADL,
such as eating,
showering and sleeping,
can be used as
a measure of functional health [3, 15].
In addition to PA, chronic diseases are also often related to diet, such as diabetes
and obesity [16].
To help tackle such problems a variety of methods are employed,
including dietary interventions focussed on achieving a nutritionally well-balanced
diet.
However, findings from nutrition research are often conflicting with regards to
the impact of snacking on diet quality and health.
One problem with interpreting the
results of relevant studies is the lack of a clear, unified definition of snacking [16–18].
Various approaches have been used throughout the literature.
Some studies focus
primarily on snacking, others consider what constitutes a meal and some researchers
use a more neutral
definition of eating events or occasions,
to include any ingestion
of food or drink.
As well
as the wide range of methods used in studies,
the defini-

tions themselves can often be based on cultural
norms and hence be biased by the
experiences of the researcher [18].
This lack of agreement restricts the dissemination
of information to the public regarding the impact of snacking on health [16].
1.2
Long term healthcare monitoring in a
residential environment
Long term monitoring of chronic conditions can aid early diagnosis and enable them
to be managed more effectively [3, 11, 19, 20].
It is important to assess patients in a
clinical setting, however there are often severe time constraints and limited resources.
Therefore observations of a patient may only give a snapshot of their condition instead
of the full picture [21,22].
There is interest in developing monitoring systems that can
be used in a residential environment to help alleviate the strain on healthcare systems
across the globe [19, 23]
and enable patients to remain independent in their own
home for longer,
thus improving quality of life [24].
Moreover,
a remote monitoring
system could be used to assist falls prevention and detect emergency events and hence
provide a rapid response [3].
This avoids scenarios where people are left lying on the
floor for hours or even days before they are found and hence reduces the risk of
further complications that result from not receiving care in a timely manner, such as
pneumonia [25].
The development of monitoring systems for use in a residential
environment are
gaining interest across several multi-disciplinary research communities [3,4,14,23–26].
In general, monitoring systems are built up of a network of sensors, which can collect
a range of
data about a person in their home.
This can include wearable sensors,
that could be used to detect movement or even vital
signs,
such as heart rate [3].
Environmental
sensors to monitor temperature,
humidity,
electricity usage,
water
usage and movement can also be installed throughout the house [27].
Additionally,
RGB-D (visual image and depth) cameras may be used to detect a person’s motion
and activities [28].
The sensors in the network communicate with a central
node
via wireless protocols,
such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Zigbee,
or a wired
connection.
The data can be fused and the results displayed on a user interface
and transmitted securely over the internet.
This allows data to be shared with key
stakeholders, such as the individual, their family members, carers or clinicians [23].
The SPHERE (a Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in a Residential
Environment)
IRC (Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration) is an EPSRC (Engineering and Phys-
ical
Sciences Research Council) funded project,
with which this PhD is associated.
The aim of the project is summed up in the project mission statement:
3
1.3.
Research aims and challenges
“The vision of SPHERE is not to develop fundamentally-new sensor tech-
nology specifically for individual disease conditions but rather to impact
a range of healthcare needs simultaneously by employing data-fusion and
pattern-recognition from a common platform of largely non-medical/environmental
networked sensors in a home environment” [29]
The SPHERE IRC project commenced in October 2013 and had initial
funding for
a duration of 5 years.
The sensor platform developed was deployed in the homes of
members of the public in year 4 of the project.
Additional funding has recently been
secured to continue the project until 2021.
The nature of the SPHERE IRC means that clinicians, engineers, computer scien-
tists, designers and many others have been collaborating on this challenge from day
one in order to develop a user friendly and effective system.
In particular, the project
is exploring the use of energy harvesting techniques and low power wireless technolo-
gies to develop a wearable device that does not require batteries to be changed or
plugged in to charge.
This makes the system easier to use in a long term monitoring
situation, particularly if the user is not able to easily interact with technology [29].
The project is using three main types of
sensors:
environmental
sensors;
video
and depth cameras and wearable sensors,
such as accelerometers [29].
Each sensing
modality has its strengths and weaknesses but by combining the data from all
of
them the best possible picture of a person’s activities within the house can be created
[30].
For example,
there are privacy concerns related to the use of cameras in some
locations such as the bathroom or bedroom but these areas can be monitored through
wearable and environmental
sensors that are less obtrusive.
On the other hand,
an
environmental
sensor would not be able to detect what a person is eating but a
camera that is correctly aligned would be able to distinguish between different types
of food [31].
1.3
Research aims and challenges
The aim of the research conducted for this thesis is to detect behaviour patterns in
data collected by a residential
healthcare monitoring system,
such as being devel-
oped by the SPHERE IRC, in order to obtain information of a greater quality than
the raw sensor data.
There are many research challenges in this area,
including:
user acceptance,
privacy concerns,
data storage and processing,
establishing ground
truth references, annotation, power requirements and cost to name a few.
This sec-
tion highlights in more detail the research challenges and the corresponding research
questions identified as the focus for this thesis.

Research aims and challenges
Detection of daily routines for healthcare monitoring.
A residential health-
care monitoring system can generate a vast wealth of data from a variety of sources.
This complex data is difficult to interpret and is not of direct use to clinicians, care-
givers or individuals being monitored.
Recognising activities from the data reduces
the quantity and complexity to some degree but generally the discovered activities
are still
at a low level
of
abstraction.
Determining how these activities are struc-
tured together in higher level routines can facilitate efficient and effective extraction
of relevant information from the data.
This knowledge can be used to inform decision
making processes related to health and well-being.
Existing work has demonstrated
the successful use of topic models to detect daily routines from activity data, based
on seven days of
real
world data collected for one person wearing two accelerom-
eters [32].
To determine whether topic models are extendible to other real
world
datasets with different activities and routines is a current research challenge.
This
can be formulated as the first of three research questions:
Can patterns in a person’s daily activities that are representative of
routines be de-
tected for a novel, real
world activity dataset?
Identification of changes in routines over time.
One key benefit
of
moni-
toring a person in their own home is that a more accurate picture of
their state
of well-being and health can be acquired over an extended period of time.
This is in
comparison to the information that can be gathered from a snapshot situation, such
as an outpatient appointment at a hospital
or a visit to a GP.
Current research in
long term monitoring and detection of
changes in behaviour patterns has focussed
on variation in activities or intensity levels.
This can result in too much information
to process efficiently if there are a lot of activities or the loss of important details if
the summary is at a high level.
Changes over time in the structure of daily routines
has not previously been investigated.
The benefit of this approach is that it enables
both a high level summary whilst still incorporating useful information from the more
detailed data.
This challenge can be formulated as the second research question:
Can changes in the structure of daily routines over time be detected?
Understanding how foods are combined in eating events.
The data gen-
erated by a residential healthcare monitoring system does not only relate to activities
of daily living.
Other types of data can also be collected, such as nutrition data in the
form of dietary intake.
Diet and eating behaviours can be linked with health outcomes
and the management of
chronic diseases.
Presently there are myriad definitions of
types of eating events,
such as a meal
or snack.
This poses a significant barrier to
comparing results across different studies and establishing clear links between eating
behaviours and the impact on diet quality and health.
The existing definitions are
limited and often influenced by language and cultural
norms.
Understanding how
5

Contributions to knowledge
people actually combine foods in different types of eating events based on real data
could facilitate analysis of how eating behaviours and health outcomes are related.
This challenge can be formulated as the final research question:
Can the combinations of foods consumed together in different types of eating events
be automatically detected?

An Introduction to Topic Models
Extracting useful information from large collections of data, such as those generated
by a residential
healthcare monitoring system,
is difficult.
Unsupervised machine
learning algorithms provide powerful tools for finding patterns and hidden structure
in data [36].
Moreover,
probabilistic models enable uncertainty in the data and un-
derlying patterns to be modelled [37].
In particular,
topic modelling algorithms,
originally developed to discover hidden themes in a large corpus of text documents,
have gained increasing popularity and have been used to find patterns in a vari-
ety of data sources.
The resulting distributions discovered in the data can be used
for analysing,
summarising,
searching,
clustering and exploring the original
large,
complex dataset [36].
This chapter introduces the background theory on machine
learning,
with a focus on topic models,
that underpins the remainder of
the work
presented in this thesis.
These concepts are described here to facilitate the analysis
of the literature reviewed in chapter 3.
2.1
Background probability theory and concepts
This section outlines the key concepts involved in the understanding of topic models
and how they are applied.
The Bayesian view of
probability theory is contrasted
against the frequentist view and the underlying Dirichlet distribution used in topic
models is introduced.
An invaluable tool,
probabilistic graphical
models,
are intro-
duced as these will be used to represent topic models.
Finally, a brief overview of the
concept behind topic models and the associated modelling assumptions are described.

2.1.
Background probability theory and concepts
2.1.1
Probability theory and Dirichlet distribution
Probability theory is vital to machine learning as it provides a consistent framework
for dealing with uncertainty.
There are two main views of probability.
Firstly,
the
frequentist view,
where probabilities are in terms of the frequencies of random,
re-
peatable events.
Secondly, the more general Bayesian view that probabilities provide
a quantification of
uncertainty.
Generally it is more useful
to adopt the Bayesian
interpretation of
probability for machine learning problems.
This approach allows
new evidence to be used to revise a quantification of
uncertainty.
The advantages
and disadvantages of each viewpoint are given below [38]:
Bayesian
+ Inclusion of prior knowledge occurs naturally
+ Deterministic approximation schemes allow use of techniques in large-scale
applications
– Often criticised that selection of prior is subjective
– Computationally expensive
Frequentist
+ Easy to compare models
– Can lead to extreme conclusions
Probabilities can follow different distributions over a random variable, such as the
binomial distribution for discrete variables and the Gaussian distribution for contin-
uous variables.
The exact nature of these distributions are controlled by parameters,
for example the mean and variance for a Gaussian, hence they are examples of para-
metric distributions.
Taking a Bayesian approach to determining suitable values for
the parameters for a particular dataset,
a prior distribution can be placed over the
parameters.
New evidence,
in the form of
observed data,
can be incorporated by
applying Bayes’ theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution.
This
Bayesian analysis can be greatly simplified by using conjugate priors,
meaning that
the posterior distribution has the same functional
form as the prior [38].
In par-
ticular,
the Dirichlet distribution has the same functional
form as the multinomial
distribution and is therefore the conjugate prior.
More specifically, consider a multinomial discrete variable as a vector of
K
mutu-
ally exclusive states
~x
= (
x
1
, x
2
, . . . , x
K
), such that only one state,
x
k
, can equal 1 and
all other states are 0.
For example, if a variable can take
K
= 4 states,
~x
= (0
,
1
,
0
,
0)
represents the observation of the variable in the state where
x
2
= 1.
Let the parame-
ter
µ
k
be the probability that
x
k
= 1, hence the vector of parameters can be written

Then for

can be represented by

.
The multinomial
distribution,

is the joint distribution of the quantities

, for
k
from 1 to
K
, conditioned on the
parameters
~
µ
and the total number of observations

Furthermore,
the conjugate prior of the multinomial
distribution is the Dirichlet
distribution over the parameters
~
µ
,
which is confined to the open simplex of
di-
mensionality
K −
1,
due to the summation constraint.
The Dirichlet distribution,
equation 2.2,
has hyperparameters
~
α
= (

) which control
the form of
the distribution [38].

For a Dirichlet distribution over 3 variables, with all
α
k
= 1, the
K−
1 simplex can
be visualised as a flat triangle, as shown in figure 2.1, where all points on the simplex
have equal probability of being sampled.
The figure shows graphs of three potential
distributions that could be sampled from the Dirichlet and their corresponding loca-
tions on the simplex.
It should be noted that the distributions corresponding to the
edge of the simplex cannot actually be achieved but can be arbitrarily close, that is,
no component of a distribution drawn from a Dirichlet will ever be zero.
This is due
to the fact that the support of the Dirichlet is the open simplex [39, 40].

the Dirichlet becomes much more sparse, as shown in figure 2.2a and for
α

Dirichlet is peakier around the expectation of
the distribution,
as shown in figure
2.2b [41].
The Dirichlet Process (DP) provides a distribution on distributions over an arbi-
trary space,
G ∼ DP
(
α, G
0
) where
G
is a random distribution over some space,
α
is the precision parameter,
a positive scalar and
G
0
is the known base distribution
over the same space as
G
.
There are two important properties of the Dirichlet Pro-
cess.
Firstly, draws from the DP are discrete, with positive probability mass at atoms
generated independently from
G
0
.
An atom is a measurable set which has positive
measure and contains no set of smaller positive measure [42].
A low value of
α
means
that there are a few dominant atoms, whilst a high value gives a discrete distribution
more similar to
G
0
.
Secondly,
the clustering property means that draws from
G
,
if
drawn itself from a DP, can be partitioned according to atoms they share [36].
2.1.2
Probabilistic graphical models
Probabilistic graphical models provide a diagrammatic representation of probability
distributions and are a very effective way of visualising and designing the structure of
probabilistic models,
rather than just using algebraic manipulations.
They provide
key insights into properties of a model,
simply through inspection of the graph and
can help simplify inference problems [38].
Graphical
models lie at the boundary of
graph theory and probability theory;
providing a formalism for understanding and
generalising the development and application of
statistical
models [43].
There are
three main types of probabilistic graphical models:
undirected graphs, directed graphs
and factor graphs, as shown in figure 2.3.
All of these use nodes, representing random
variables, connected by edges, representing statistical dependencies between variables.
12
2.1.
Background probability theory and concepts
(a) Undirected graph
(b) Directed graph
(c) Factor graph
Figure 2.3:
Examples of the three main types of graphical models
Shaded nodes are observed variables and unshaded nodes are latent (hidden) variables
[44].
Each type of graphical model is better suited to expressing different aspects of
the model and it is possible to convert between them if required [38].
In this thesis, the focus is on directed acyclic graphs, also known as Bayesian net-
works or belief networks.
The arrows in these graphs represent causal relationships.
The node at the start of the arrow is the parent,
pa
(
i
),
and the node
i
at the head
is the child.
For example,
in the directed graph,
figure 2.3b,
node A is the parent
of node C and equivalently,
node C is the child of node A.
The absence of edges in
these graphs is significant as it conveys conditional independence between the random
variables.
It should be noted that these graphs cannot contain any directed cycles.
It is possible to determine a factorisation of the joint probability distribution directly
from the graph [44].
For example,
the factorisation for the directed graph in figure
2.3b is given in equation 2.3.
p
(
A, B, C, D, E
) =
p
(
A
)

(
B|A
)
p
(
C|A
)
p
(
D|A, B, C
)
p

(2.3)
In general the factorisation for a directed graph is given by equation 2.4 [44].

(2.4)
where
x
1:
N
are the
N
nodes and
x
pa
(

)
are the parents of node
i
Plates are another useful tool in graphical models, as they make the notation more
compact.
They are boxes drawn around a group of one or more nodes, representing
that the nodes within the box are replicated a given number of times, which is stated
in the bottom right hand corner of the box.
For example, observations

conditioned on A and B can be represented explicitly as shown on the right of

2.1.3
Topic model concept
Topic models were originally developed to aid the understanding of large corpora of
text.
They allow hidden topical patterns within a corpus to be uncovered using unsu-
pervised learning.
This enables documents to be annotated automatically according
to the topics that are referred to in their content.
This is particularly useful
when
using optical
character recognition to digitise archived material
that has not been
given keyword labels.
These annotations can be used to organise,
summarise and
search the whole corpus in new and meaningful ways [36, 41, 46, 47].
In order to discover the hidden topical patterns in a corpus it is required to model
the original
creation of
the documents that make up the corpus.
The model
does
not need to accurately reflect the process undertaken by a human when writing a
document but just describe a mathematical
procedure that would give the relevant
outcome,
given a set of
assumptions.
In particular,
it is important to note that
the resultant document created using this process is just a bag of
words,
with no
ordering,
and hence would be unreadable to a human.
The probabilistic generative
model of creating a document is shown in figure 2.5.
The process involves repeating
the following steps for every document in the corpus [41]:
1.
Choose a distribution over topics from a Dirichlet distribution (topic propor-
tions for document, represented by the histogram in figure 2.5)
2.
For each word:

•
Draw a topic from this distribution (topic assignment,
represented by a
coloured coin in figure 2.5)
•
Draw a word from the topic (a distribution over the vocabulary,
drawn
from a Dirichlet distribution)
The modelling assumptions are [41]:
•
The vocabulary of words chosen is fixed for each model
•
Topics are distributions over the vocabulary
•
The are a fixed number of topics, K, chosen for each model
•
The probability of each word varies for each topic
•
Each document is a random mixture of corpus-wide topics
•
Each word in a document is drawn from one topic
2.2
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
This section formalises the mathematical model behind the concept of topic models,
known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Different inference methods to approx-
imate the posterior distribution are highlighted.
The selected method of variational
inference and estimation of the model parameters are then presented in more detail.

Probabilistic model
Figure 2.6:
Graphical model for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
In reality,
the process of
a document being created is not seen,
it is only possi-
ble to observe the resultant documents.
It is desired to infer the underlying topic
structure,
that is to work out the distributions that could have been used to create
the documents.
In order to achieve this it is helpful
to model
the whole concept
as a probabilistic graphical
model,
known as LDA [46],
shown in figure 2.6.
The
generative process of creating a corpus of documents defines a joint probability dis-
tribution over the observed words and the latent variables representing the topics,
topic proportions and topic assignments [48].
The joint distribution of all the hidden
and observed variables can be determined directly from the graph in figure 2.6 and
is given by equation 2.6 [47, 48].
The dependencies between the variables represented
by the graphical
model
and mathematical
equation are what defines LDA [48]
and
match the statistical assumptions behind the generative process described.

The numerator is the joint distribution of all the variables, equation 2.6, and can
easily be evaluated for any setting of the hidden variables.
However, the denominator,
which is the marginal probability of the observed words in the corpus under any topic
model, is intractable to compute.
This is due to the fact that the number of possible
hidden topic structures,
which have to be summed over to compute this value,
is
exponentially large [46, 48].
Therefore, it is required to use an approximate posterior
inference algorithm to estimate a solution [41, 46].
Various approaches can be taken to perform approximate inference of
the pos-
terior,
including sampling-based algorithms and deterministic methods.
The aim is
to estimate an approximation as close to the true posterior,
equation 2.7,
as possi-
ble [48].
Inference methods developed include collapsed Gibbs sampling,
mean field
variational Bayesian inference, collapsed Bayesian inference and maximum a posteri-
ori estimation.
Asuncion et al.
compare the similarities and performance of different
methods [50].
They demonstrate that the choice of
hyperparameters has as large
an impact on the results as the choice of algorithm.
Although variational
Bayesian
inference is often the worst performing algorithm,
it is not by a significant amount
for well
chosen hyperparameters.
Therefore,
for the purposes of
this work,
David
Blei’s implementation of variational inference for LDA [51] is used as this allows di-
rect comparison with previous work completed by Huynh et al. [32], as discussed in
section 4.1.1.
2.2.2
Variational inference and parameter estimation
The goal
of performing inference is to estimate the posterior distribution given the
observed words.
In other words,
to determine the topics,
~
β
1:
K
;
per document topic
distributions,
~
θ
1:
D
and per word topic assignments,
z
1:
D,
1:
N
.
The hyperparameters
of the LDA model,
~
α
and
η
can either be selected in advance or estimated, from an
initial seed value, for a given dataset as part of the inference algorithm.

2.2.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
More generally,
given a set of
observations
x
1:
N
and latent variables
z
1:
M
,
it is
often difficult to efficiently compute the marginal
likelihood of the observations,
as
is the case for LDA.
Variational
methods are a deterministic alternative to Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that use established optimisation techniques
instead of
sampling.
For large problems variational
methods are faster and more
scalable than MCMC, however they are also biased [41].
The idea is to determine the
evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log probability of the observations, log
p
(
x
1:
N
),
given by equation 2.8.
Jensen’s inequality states that
f
(
E
[
x
])
≥ E
[
f
(
x
)] for a concave
function
f
(
x
), where
E
denotes the expectation and this is used to derive the ELBO.

and
p
(
z

, x

) is the joint proba-
bility distribution over the observed and latent variables.
It can be seen that a distribution
q
ν
(
z
1:
M
) over the latent variables with free
variational
parameters
ν
is introduced by multiplying and dividing by it.
These
parameters are then optimised to make the bound as tight as possible,
in other
words, to find a member of the family
q
ν
(
z
1:
M
) that is closest in Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence to the posterior distribution
p
(
z
1:
M
|x
1:
N
) [41, 46, 49].
The factorisation of
q
ν
(
z
1:
M
) determines the complexity of the optimisation.
In mean field variational
inference the variational
distribution is chosen to be
fully factored,
as shown in equation 2.9.
This means that each latent variable is
independent and governed by its own variational parameter
ν
i
.
This is beneficial as
it is often the dependence exhibited in the true posterior that makes exact inference
intractable [41, 46].
In terms of
the graphical
model
this is equivalent to removing
problematic edges between nodes.
For example, in LDA the denominator of the true
posterior, equation 2.7, is intractable due to the problematic coupling between
~
θ
d
and
~
β
k
, which arises from the edges between
~
θ
d
,
z
d,n
and
w
d,n
in the graphical model.
The
model
can be simplified by removing these edges and the
w
d,n
nodes and using free
variational parameters for
~
θ
d
and
z
d,n
[46].

denoted as

expressed as

Assume also that each factor

The optimal

found using the coordinate ascent algorithm, where the update is given by equation

Mean field variational
inference can be used to estimate the intractable poste-
rior distribution for LDA.
Here we consider
~
β
1:
K
to be a parameter of the observed
words,
that is a fixed quantity to be estimated,
rather than drawing the topic dis-
tributions from a Dirichlet with hyperparameter
η
.
The details of this approach are
given because the work presented in this thesis is based on Blei’s implementation
of
variational
inference for LDA [51]
which follows this assumption,
as outlined in
his seminal paper [46].
Taking this into account, for each document, the variational
distribution over the latent variables such that all variables are independent is given
by equation 2.11.

function i.e.

A full derivation can be found
in Blei et al. [46].
The results of performing variational
inference at the document level
provides a
tractable lower bound on the log probability of
the observations,
as desired.
This

2.3
Extensions to Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Topic models were originally based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation,
as discussed in
2.2.
However,
this model
has some short comings and is not suitable for solving all
problems.
In particular,
LDA assumes that data are exchangeable,
i.e.
the order
of
documents and order of
words does not matter.
Furthermore,
the use of
finite
hierarchical mixtures means that the number of topics needs to be known in advance
and is then fixed for that model.
Several extensions to the original graphical model
of LDA have been developed and applied to problems both within and beyond the
natural
language processing community [36].
Extensions relevant to this thesis are
presented in this section.
2.3.1
Dynamic topic models
Dynamic topic models (DTMs) extend LDA by including a model
of the evolution
of the topics over time,
whereas documents are assumed to be exchangeable within
a corpus for LDA. This is achieved by dividing the data into
T
time slices, such as a
year, and then modelling the documents in each time slice using LDA with
K
topics.
Each time slice is a separate LDA model and information is only shared between each
instance by chaining together the topics and thus sequentially tying the collection of
20
2.3.
Extensions to Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Figure 2.7:
Graphical model for Dynamic Topic Model
topic models.
The topics can smoothly evolve from time slice
t −
1 to
t
, as shown in
figure 2.7.
As the Dirichlet distribution is not suitable for sequential modelling, the
logistic normal distribution is used to capture uncertainty about the time-series topics
by embedding it in a state-space model.
Each topic is represented by a multivariate
Gaussian random variable,
which are modelled to evolve with Gaussian noise.
The
words drawn from these topics are then mapped to the simplex [36, 47, 53].
Variational
inference can also used to estimate the posterior for DTMs.
In fact,
the nonconjugacy of the Gaussian and multinomial distributions makes this an easier
method to implement than alternative sampling based techniques [53].
The approxi-
mate variational posterior for the DTM is given by equation 2.14.
Note that at the
document level this is the same as equation 2.11 for LDA.

The conjugate gradient method is
used to optimise the variational observations for the topics.
An approximation based
on a Kalman filter is used in the implementation utilised in this thesis (chapter 5).
Further details of this approach can be found in Blei and Lafferty [53].
2.3.2
Other extensions
The two models used in the work of this thesis are LDA and DTMs that have been
described.
Other extensions to LDA are mentioned here for completeness as they are
considered for future work.
LDA requires the number of
topics to be defined before estimating the model,
however,
the choice of
the number of
topics is not well
defined.
Often it is chosen
by examining the fit to held-out documents or using the marginal probability of the
whole collection but this is time consuming and does not always yield the optimal
result.
Bayesian non-parametric methods can be used to solve this problem.
In
particular,
Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) allow the number of topics to be
infinite a priori.
In addition,
previously unseen documents can evoke a previously
unseen topic i.e.
an atom that has not yet appeared [36].
The graphical
model
for Hierarchical
Dirichlet Processes is shown in figure 2.8.
It can be seen that the topic proportions
~
θ
d
in LDA,
are replaced by a distribution
over topics
G
d
drawn from a Dirichlet Process,
DP
(
α, G
0
), where
α
is the precision
parameter and
G
0
is the base distribution over topics.
G
0
is also drawn from a
Dirichlet Process,
DP
(
γ, H
), where H is a symmetric Dirichlet on the word simplex
and
γ
is the precision parameter.
Hence, the atoms of the per-document distributions
22
2.4.
Analysis of topic model performance
Figure 2.8:
Graphical model for Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes
over topics are shared across documents.
The clustering property guarantees that the
words in a document share a subset of topics [36].
Dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (dHDP) extend HDPs by modelling how
topic-proportions change over time.
This is distinct from a DTM, which models how
topics change over time.
This is achieved by positing a distribution over topics
G
t
corresponding to all
documents at time
t
.
The model
imposes a generally smooth
evolution of
G
t
but allows sharp changes in time if
required by the data.
As with
HDPs, the number of topics is inferred from the data.
This model also assumes that
data is not temporally exchangeable [36].
The author-topic model
[54]
extends LDA to model
the association between au-
thors and topics using a multinomial
distribution.
This enables information about
which topics authors write about to be obtained, as well as the topics that make up
a document.
The idea behind the correlated topic model
is to assume that there is
a relationship between the different topics discovered.
This relationship is explicitly
modelled using the logistic normal
distribution so that it can be quantified as an
output of the correlated topic model [47].
2.4
Analysis of topic model performance
Clearly, it is important to analyse the results of topic models to determine how well
they are performing [55, 56].
However,
this analysis is not straightforward as it is
not easy to define what the ‘best’
performance is.
In particular,
a model
may find
patterns that a human would not have thought of
but are actually relevant and
useful for answering a particular question.
A variety of different methods have been
developed to try and assess the performance of topic models [55–58].
These can be
split into two categories:
quantitative and qualitative analysis.
23
2.4.
Analysis of topic model performance
There is no universal method of accurately and efficiently measuring the generali-
sation of a topic model that is independent of any specific application.
However, one
method that is often used in the topic modelling literature is an estimate of the prob-
ability of held-out documents for a trained model.
A measure known as perplexity is
the inverse of the geometric mean per-word likelihood on a held-out set of documents
using a model learned on a set of training documents.
For a set of
M
test documents
the perplexity can be calculated using equation 2.15 [46].
perplexity(
D
1:
M
) = exp
(
−
P
M
d
=1
log
p
(
w
d,
1:
N
)
P
M
d
=1
N
)
(2.15)
where
D
1:
M
is the test set of M documents,
w
d,
1:
N
are the N words in the d
th
document.
A lower perplexity suggests a better generalisation performance of the model because
the log function gives high values for low probability words.
Moreover, this measure
can be used to select the parameters for the model,
such as an optimal
number of
topics for a given dataset [59].
Although quantitative analysis of the performance of a topic model can be useful,
it does not necessarily mean that the results are semantically beneficial.
In fact,
it
can often be the case that model A gives more semantically useful results than model
B even though model B performs better when measuring the probability of held-out
documents [57].
Qualitative analysis investigates the semantic quality of topics found,
that is, an expert’s judgement of how ‘useful’ a topic is to the user.
Various methods
have been proposed to try and quantify the variable semantic quality of topics.
These
include human scoring of topics [56], word and topic intrusion methods [57] and graph
mining techniques [58].
These methods of qualitative evaluation have been developed for the original ap-
plication of text processing and are not directly applicable to the problems considered
in this thesis.
They have been used as inspiration for new evaluation methods for the
specific applications of activity monitoring and nutrition.
In particular, visualisations
of topic model results, expert opinions and existing methods from the application ar-
eas have been utilised.
These are presented in more detail in the relevant chapters.

Chapter 3
Data Fusion for Healthcare
Monitoring in Residential
Environments
This chapter reviews the literature related to processing and understanding the data
that can be collected from a healthcare monitoring system in a residential
environ-
ment.
In particular, a brief summary of the field of data fusion is given for context.
Previous work using different types of
sensors suitable for this application is con-
sidered and gaps in the literature are identified.
It should be noted that healthcare
monitoring systems focusing on the use of physiological sensors are beyond the scope
of this review.
To date,
there has been a greater focus on monitoring at the activity level
and
fewer studies have considered investigating the higher level
of
behaviour patterns
and daily routines that can be detected from activity data [60].
The work that has
been done in this area is reviewed in more detail,
with a strong focus on the use
of
topic models to achieve this goal.
Moreover,
the use of
topic models to detect
daily routines from other types of data is also considered.
Finally, the application of
topic models to nutrition data, which could be generated by a residential healthcare
monitoring system is addressed.
Diet and nutrition are highly correlated with health,
especially chronic diseases.
Understanding eating behaviour patterns in greater detail
aids research into the impact of these relationships.

3.1
Residential healthcare monitoring systems
Monitoring systems in the home can provide individuals with a greater insight into
their own health and well-being.
They also provide clinicians with previously un-
available data that can aid early diagnosis and treatment of
diseases.
However,
a
monitoring system generates a large wealth of data from a variety of sources, which
has no clear meaning by itself.
In order for the data to benefit the users it must be
combined to obtain information that can directly influence decisions and actions [61].
The idea of fusing data from different sensors has been a challenge for a variety of
research communities over the last few decades.
This section summarises some of the
key work in this area and how it relates to this application.
Various types of sensors can be included in a monitoring system, including wear-
able sensors,
environmental
sensors and video cameras [62].
This section reviews
studies that have investigated activity monitoring in a residential
environment,
pri-
marily using environmental
sensors.
The use of wearable sensors for recognition of
activities of daily living that occur in a residential environment is also addressed.
A
‘wearable’ or ‘body worn’ sensor is considered to be a sensor that can be externally
attached to a person, such as a wristband, clipped onto a belt or worn as a piece of
jewellery.
The sensor(s) in the device can vary but for activity recognition accelerom-
eters are the most commonly used [62, 63].
Video based activity recognition is not
considered in this review as this was the focus of a separate work package within the
SPHERE project.
3.1.1
Data fusion definition and models
The phrase ‘data fusion’
is used widely in the literature,
yet there is still
not a
consensus on the exact definition of
this term and associated expressions [64–66].
This problem was recognised by the remote sensing community and hence a working
group was set up to address the need for terms of reference in data fusion, presenting
their findings in [65].
It was felt that any definition for data fusion should not be
restrictive to a specific domain or method,
therefore the following definition was
proposed.
“Data fusion is a formal
framework in which are expressed means and
tools for the alliance of data originating from different sources.
It aims at
obtaining information of greater quality;
the exact definition of ‘greater
quality’ will depend upon the application”
Buchroithner and Wald, January 1998 [65]

Residential healthcare monitoring systems
Although various definitions exist, it is clear that the key concepts that underpin
the field of data fusion are:
combining data;
using multiple sources and improving
quality [67].
The advantages of
using multiple sensors are myriad,
as discussed in
[68, 69].
They include:
•
Inherent redundancy for improved reliability and robustness
•
Extended spatial and temporal coverage
•
Increased confidence in measurements
•
Shorter measurement and response times
•
Improved resolution
•
Increased dimensionality
•
Higher signal-to-noise ratio
•
Increased hypothesis discrimination
There are a variety of frameworks and models available in the literature that have
been developed to help implement a functional data fusion system [66].
Frameworks
provide a structure for designing a complex system composed of multiple data sources
which need to be acquired,
processed and communicated.
If
they are not directly
applicable they can be modified to meet the specific requirements of
a particular
application [65, 68, 69].
One of the first and most popular data fusion models was developed by the Joint
Directors of Laboratories (JDL) Data Fusion Working Group [70].
Developed in the
context of military applications, it has some shortcomings for other application areas
but the main principles are fundamental
[66, 69, 71].
Moreover,
the model
has since
been extended and used as a basis for other models [68, 70, 72].
The JDL data fusion
process model includes three main levels of processing that occur to data which comes
in from the sources and is output for human computer interaction.
There is a fourth
meta-process for refinement of the overall
process and preprocessing of raw data is
sometimes considered an additional level [70, 73].
Luo and Kay proposed the Multi-sensor Integration Model [74] where integration
is the use of multiple sensor information for a task, whilst fusion is considered as the
actual combination of data.
Both fusion and integration occur simultaneously.
The
model includes hierarchical, sequential fusion centres and measurements from sensors
can be fused at one or more levels [69, 75].
Dasarathy [76]
defined the functions of
data fusion in terms of the relationship between the type of input and output data,
which can be data, features or objects.
This categorisation is useful as it can be easily
mapped to specific techniques and algorithms [73].
Thomopoulos proposed the use of
three modules at different levels:
signal,
evidence and dynamics level.
The levels of
fusion can be sequential or interchangeable, depending on the application.
Moreover,
27

Residential healthcare monitoring systems
Thomopoulos highlighted the importance of monotonicity of fused information and
robustness against a-priori uncertainty in any data fusion system [69].
More recently several models and frameworks have been suggested for healthcare
applications.
Lee et al.
propose a ‘Pervasive Healthcare Architecture’
[77]
which
includes a data fusion module to combine data from different types of sensors used
in a pervasive healthcare monitoring system.
Gong et al.
[78]
incorporate multiple
preferences in their model
to provide flexibility in what is considered important in
different applications.
The model is suitable for many wireless sensor networks but is
designed with a specific focus on healthcare monitoring.
A customisable framework
for collaborative body sensor network applications is described in [79].
The frame-
work supports a three-layer model for multi-sensor data fusion, which is extended to
support collaborative computing between networks.
Rodriguez et al. [80] present a system based on PANGEA, a multi-agent architec-
ture which provides a high level
framework for intelligent information fusion.
They
demonstrate the use of this healthcare monitoring system in a residential care home
for 8 months.
King et al
[34]
describe a generic centralised hierarchical
data fusion
model for wearable health monitoring, incorporating ideas from the JDL and Multi-
sensor Integration models.
This model uses three levels of abstraction, signal, feature
and decision level
fusion as well
as pre-processing and feature extraction steps as
required.
Data from each sensor passes through one or more of
the fusion centres
as appropriate.
Cao et al.
[81]
developed an integrated framework for multi-modal
activity recognition that includes correcting for class imbalance,
caused by varying
frequencies and durations of different types of activities.
They propose that fusion
happens at the post classification level, i.e.
the labels predicted by different classifiers
are fused to reduce errors.
3.1.2
Data fusion algorithms
There are many different data fusion algorithms and techniques [66].
These are often
categorised into three levels,
although the names given to each level
varies.
Here,
the simple labels of low, middle and high level fusion are used to minimise confusion.
Luo et al.
[75]
provide a useful
reference table that summarises the key advantages
and disadvantages of
some of
the methods for each level.
An alternative approach
to looking at available data fusion algorithms and techniques is taken by Khaleghi et
al.
[66],
where methods are considered in terms of data-related challenges that can
be addressed.
In particular,
different frameworks for dealing with uncertainty are
highlighted.
Moreover, Castanedo [67] outlines the different approaches that can be
taken to classifying data fusion techniques.
A summary of
the type of
algorithms
28
3.1.
Residential healthcare monitoring systems
and specific examples based on the three fusion levels convention are given here
for context.
The choice of
algorithm relies on finding an agreement between the
application requirements and the relevant advantages and disadvantages of available
techniques at the appropriate level.
At the low level of data fusion there is a need to synchronise and adapt the data due
to varying sampling properties across multiple sensors.
Techniques for low level fusion
can be broadly separated into two categories:
statistical
estimation and covariance
based methods.
Statistical estimation methods can be non-recursive, such as weighted
averages or least squares,
which both merge redundant data.
Alternatively,
they
can be recursive,
for example a Kalman Filter,
which is a predict-update type of
estimator.
Furthermore there are also Extended Kalman Filters,
which linearise
about a point and Unscented Kalman Filters for non-linear filtering.
Covariance based
methods include cross covariance, covariance intersection which is used if sensor data
are not independent and covariance union which solves the problem of information
corruption [75].
The aim of
the middle data fusion level
is to group the data into classified sets
within a multidimensional feature space.
Again, techniques can be broadly separated
into two categories:
parametric and non-parametric.
Parametric methods include
parametric templates,
which are used for image processing,
k-means clustering and
Na¨ıve Bayes.
The non-parametric methods include learning vector quantization,
kohonen feature maps, artificial neural networks and support vector machines.
Prior
assumptions about the distribution of input data are not required for non-parametric
classification algorithms, which can be advantageous for some applications [75].
High level data fusion methods use a symbolic representation of information.
Sym-
bols, with an associated level of uncertainty, are combined to give a composite deci-
sion.
Therefore,
algorithms at this level
must be tolerant of imprecision and uncer-
tainty.
There are a variety of
techniques that can be used for inference.
Bayesian
inference is a probabilistic framework for recursive state estimation.
Particle filters
are a modern sequential
monte carlo bayesian method based on point mass repre-
sentation of
posterior probability density.
Topic models are a type of
hierarchical
mixture model,
used to find hidden patterns [36].
Dempster-Shafer theory is based
on the concept of degrees of belief whilst fuzzy logic is a multivalue logic that allows
uncertainty in multi-sensor fusion to be directly represented.
Artificial
intelligence
methods,
such as neural
networks,
can also be used for high level
fusion [75].
Each
method has associated modelling assumptions which must fit with the problem do-
main they are used for.
29
3.1.
Residential healthcare monitoring systems
Grouping available algorithms in different ways is a useful
reference point when
selecting algorithms, however expert knowledge about the specific application is still
required to choose the most appropriate technique.
Various review papers have pre-
sented different view points for considering appropriate data fusion techniques within
the broad fields of
healthcare monitoring and activity recognition.
Lai
et al.
[82]
present a survey of body sensor networks, which are often used for healthcare mon-
itoring.
They include a section that reviews the data fusion methods that can be
used for both physiological sensors and inertial sensors.
Major challenges in the field
are highlighted,
including the impact of
architecture choice and data management
requirements on the selection of fusion methods.
King et al. [34] concentrate on data
fusion techniques for wearable health monitoring systems.
A discussion of the con-
siderations for selecting a suitable algorithm for a particular application is included.
Pires et al. [83] focus their comprehensive review on fusion techniques for identi-
fying activities of daily living within the constraints of using mobile devices.
They
include a summary of advantages and disadvantages of different categories of meth-
ods,
but conclude that the choice of the best method is dependent on many factors
specific to a particular application.
The challenges related to data fusion for fall de-
tection systems, which can be incorporated in a more general healthcare monitoring
system,
are considered by Koshmak et al.
[84].
In particular,
they emphasise the
benefit of
developing a system with more than one sensor type e.g.
ambient and
wearable.
In addition,
they propose that monitoring systems should be modular so
that different components can be added and removed as required.
A detailed review of sensor-based activity recognition is given by Chen et al. [63]
with application to many areas,
including healthcare.
They review activity recog-
nition models and algorithms using a hierarchical
structure,
firstly differentiating
between data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches and then sub-dividing these
categories further.
Within the data-driven category,
generative and discriminative
models are considered and mining, logic and ontology based approaches are included
in the knowledge-driven category.
The advantages and disadvantages of these differ-
ent approaches are discussed and summarised.
Moreover,
the impact of the context
on the choice of approach is highlighted.
Future research trends are considered,
in-
cluding the use of domain knowledge and context ontologies to facilitate high level
semantic data fusion.
Other surveys discuss algorithms used for activity recognition
at different levels but do not specifically focus on data fusion.
Thus, these papers are
presented in section 3.1.4.

3.1.3
Activity monitoring in a residential environment
The literature in the field of activity monitoring in a residential environment is vast
and it is not feasible to include everything here.
Ni et al. [62] provide an extremely
comprehensive survey of various aspects of smart home technology, with a particular
focus on older people’s independent living.
They dedicate section 2 to reviewing
recent surveys,
projects and applications of
smart homes.
Alam et al.
[85]
discuss
the history and future of smart homes, including the application of healthcare.
They
consider a wide range of aspects from communication protocols to sensor types and
algorithm choice as well
as reviewing relevant projects.
Detailed reviews of
both
Ambient-Assisted Living (AAL) tools and smart home sensor technology are provided
by Rashidi & Mihailidis [86] and Ding et al. [87] respectively.
This section only considers activity monitoring within a real
residential
environ-
ment for a period of greater than 24 hours.
Data collection of activities in a simulated
residential environment set up within a laboratory are not included here.
This focus
was chosen as it is in-line with the work of
the SPHERE project,
with which this
PhD was associated.
Applying different algorithms and techniques to data collected
‘in the wild’ can produce very different results compared with controlled laboratory
conditions due to the unpredictable nature and challenges of
a complex,
natural
environment [88].
Furthermore,
short snapshots of
data do not provide a realistic
representation of the variety of activities that a person performs.
Several
studies have investigated monitoring of
people using sensors installed in
their own home [89–93]
or a dedicated smart home / AAL environment [26, 27, 94]
for healthcare and well-being applications.
These studies primarily use environmen-
tal
sensors within the home to detect users’
activities.
The sensors used include:
various motion detectors, including infra-red sensors [26, 89–91, 93, 94]; reed or mag-
netic switches on doors and cupboards [27, 89, 91, 94];
toilet flush and water flow
sensors [27, 91];
watt-meters or electric current flow sensors [27, 89];
environmental
sensors e.g.
humidity,
light,
barometric pressure [27];
gas sensors [27];
stove sensor
(to detect heat or flames) [26, 89, 93, 94]; motion sensors mounted on specific objects,
including a bed [26, 27, 93, 94] and a gait / fall monitor based on floor vibrations [93].
A few key projects are presented to highlight the benefits and limitations of different
types of sensors and system designs.
One significant project is the PlaceLab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
a highly instrumented living environment,
consisting of a living room,
dining area,
kitchen, small office, bedroom and bathroom, that can be used for observing activities
and interactions of everyday home life [95].
The environment includes an addressable
speaker system and a large network of
sensors that can be added to as required.
31
3.1.
Residential healthcare monitoring systems
Sensors include switches on doors and cupboards, environmental sensors, water and
gas flow sensors,
cameras and microphones.
Additionally,
accelerometers can be
attached to moveable objects and worn by participants living in the apartment.
A
dataset of 104 hours of annotated data from over 900 sensors of a couple who lived in
the PlaceLab for 10 weeks was collected [27].
The annotations were done by a third
party based on the video data.
A detailed discussion of the limitations and challenges
of performing activity recognition on data from a real-world setting is provided in [27].
In particular,
complex behaviours,
such as multi-tasking and interactions between
participants make it challenging to differentiate between activities and label
them
effectively.
Using a large number of sensors integrated into a dedicated living space
allows an extremely rich and detailed dataset to be collected.
However,
the cost of
installing and maintaining complex systems is not feasible on a large scale and it is
intrusive for users to have so many sensors, especially cameras, in their living space.
The CASAS (Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems) project at Wash-
ington State University [96] has a dedicated three-bedroom smart apartment on their
campus.
The apartment is instrumented with a range of sensors, including infra-red
motion/light detectors,
ambient temperature sensors,
door switches and sensors for
monitoring water, stove and phone use.
This testbed is often used for validating new
algorithms but can also accommodate residents living there for longer term studies.
A novel activity discovery method was developed that uses an unsupervised approach
to recognise and track activities in the smart home.
This was applied to three months
of daily activity data collected from two residents [96].
Unsupervised approaches offer
the strong advantage of not requiring annotated training data which is challenging
to collect.
A large number of sensors, such as used in the PlaceLab and main CASAS test bed,
is not viable at scale.
The CASAS project developed a ‘smart home in a box’ solution
for easily instrumenting residential
environments with smart home technology.
The
system is affordable for large scale deployment and can be installed within 2 hours
without making any changes to the home.
It includes motion detectors,
door and
temperature sensors.
The CASAS design has currently been installed in 32 testbeds
and datasets collected from these environments are publicly available [94].
This is
an invaluable resource for testing and comparing different methods,
with greater
confidence in the conclusions.
The disadvantage of reduced scale systems is the lack
of detail in the data collected and challenges in detecting anomalies, such as visitors.
Van Kasteren et al. [97, 98] have also designed an easy-to-install system consisting
of
contact switches,
pressure mats,
mercury contacts,
passive infrared sensors and
float sensors for the toilet flush.
The addition of extra sensors such as the float sensor
do not significantly increase the cost and complexity of the system but can add extra
32

Residential healthcare monitoring systems
important detail
and context.
For example,
only a motion sensor in the bathroom
does not give any information about what someone is doing,
whereas knowing the
toilet has been flushed means it is highly likely that the toilet has been used and
this can be a useful
measure for health outcomes.
This system was installed in
three different residential environments of varying size and layout and hence different
numbers of sensors.
Datasets were collected for different users, living in each residence over a period of
2 - 4 weeks.
These were annotated using either a handwritten diary or a Bluetooth
headset and speech recognition software.
The datasets and source code for the prob-
abilistic models used to analyse the data have been made publicly available.
The
variety in the datasets collected enables transfer learning to be applied when little or
no labelled data is available for a new house by using a model
learnt on a previous
house.
Ordonez et al.
compared a full Bayesian inference approach with learning the
maximum a posterior model parameters when using a hidden Markov model (HMM)
for activity recognition [99].
They demonstrated that the Bayesian inference gives a
significantly better performance, particularly in a transfer learning framework.
The University of Virginia developed a wireless in-home monitoring system that
consisted of motion sensors, a stove temperature sensor and a bed sensor system [26].
The system was installed in the assisted living units of 22 participants, 7 of whom were
memory care unit residents, for a period of 3 months.
Collecting data for a relevant
cohort of participants is vital to ensure that the systems and algorithms developed are
fit for purpose.
A rule-based inference method was used to automatically determine
the participants key activities of daily living (ADLs).
The results from multiple users
were used to prioritise the care needs of the patients [26].
Another study installed
the same system, with the addition of a passive floor-vibration gait monitor and fall
detector,
in the homes of 13 home health care agency clients for four months.
One
particular case study highlighted that the system’s ability to monitor ADLs, such as
bathroom visits could have avoided a patient’s hospitalisation had the doctors been
able to see this data [93].
The Empath platform was also developed at the University of
Virginia [100]
to
monitor people with depression.
This platform integrates both the analysis software
and the hardware,
including:
motion sensors and contact reed switches for activity
detection; a sleep monitoring system using accelerometers in the bed; WiFi weighing
scales;
a microphone on a touchscreen device for speech analysis and an iPhone
to record mood.
The Empath system was installed,
in less than an hour,
in the
apartment of a patient for a period of 14 days.
The study demonstrated that various
factors linked to depression could be successfully measured in a home environment.
It shows how sensors can be selected to provide specific data that is relevant for
33

Residential healthcare monitoring systems
monitoring a known condition.
However, the activity detection could be improved to
give more detailed information than room occupancy and estimated energy levels.
3.1.4
Wearable sensors for activity recognition
The focus for this section is to review the literature in the area of detecting activities
using wearable sensors.
They offer the advantages of being directly associated with a
specific person and providing more detailed information about an individual’s move-
ments and activities.
User compliance is critical though, as no data can be collected
if the user forgets to wear the device,
which is a particular risk for certain cohorts,
such as people with dementia.
Human activity recognition has a wide range of appli-
cations and includes detection of simple actions or gestures, through to higher level,
more complex activities such as ‘having dinner’ [63, 101, 102].
Chen et al. [60] present
an overview of recent survey and review papers for activity recognition, focusing on
inertial sensors in section 3.
This highlights the vast nature of the literature, which is
summarised in this section, including the fusion of wearable sensors with other sensor
types.
Table 3.1 provides a reference for the different areas of focus for the wearable
sensor review papers discussed here.

Bulling et al. [103] provide a comprehensive tutorial on human activity recognition
with a specific focus on the use of on-body inertial sensors.
Godfrey et al. [104] give
a detailed background on the use of
accelerometers to measure human movement,
including considerations of sensor placement and algorithms for data analysis.
Lara
and Labrador [101] survey the state of the art for a wide range of aspects of human
activity recognition using wearable sensors:
from system design to classification al-
gorithms and evaluations of
complete systems.
They present a taxonomy to assist
the comparison and analysis of
different systems that have similar characteristics.
34
3.1.
Residential healthcare monitoring systems
Finally,
they highlight important directions for future research efforts,
such as ad-
dressing the complex nature of
composite and concurrent activities,
including at a
routine level.
A survey by Avci
et al.
[105]
analyses research in activity recognition
using inertial
sensors with applications in healthcare,
well-being and sports.
They
segment the activity recognition process into five steps and present the algorithms
and techniques that can be utilised at each stage.
Classification of individual activi-
ties is the highest level of fusion included in this survey.
They include a summary of
the relationship between different classification techniques, sensor placement and the
corresponding reported accuracy level.
Two review papers in this area have been contributed by Preece et al. [106, 107].
The first focuses on comparing 14 methods,
based on wavelet transforms and fre-
quency and time characteristics, for extracting classification features from accelerom-
eter data for recognising activities [106].
They used two datasets to compare the dif-
ferent feature sets used as input to a k-nearest neighbour classifier.
It was shown that
time and frequency characteristics based on an ankle sensor outperformed wavelet
transforms for dynamic activities carried out by healthy participants.
However, this
is a limited conclusion because the results will vary for different classifiers and demo-
graphics.
The second paper provides a review of classification techniques for activity
identification using wearable sensors [107].
This includes techniques at different lev-
els,
from windowing the raw sensor data through to classification algorithms.
They
highlight studies that use a range of
different machine learning techniques for ac-
tivity recognition and also focus specifically on fall
detection.
They emphasise the
variability in the nature of datasets, making meaningful comparisons between meth-
ods challenging.
Jatoba et al. [108] review a variety of techniques for classification of physical ac-
tivity as a method to provide context when monitoring the ECG (electrocardiogram)
and blood pressure of a patient with cardiovascular disease over a long period in a
non-clinical
environment.
Different levels are considered,
from data preprocessing
through to classification algorithms.
They collected a dataset of daily activities and
compared the accuracy of different methods.
For this specific dataset it was found
that the best results were given by the classification and regression tree and adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system.
In addition,
Mannini
and Sabatini
[109]
also review
a range of activity recognition methods and describe their application to simulated
datasets based on the daily activity accelerometer dataset from Bao and Intille [110].
They compare the results and conclude that a continuous hidden Markov model
is
optimal when spurious data is removed for this dataset.
Moreover, they summarise a
variety of human activity classification systems in the literature, including details of
sensors, features, classifiers, number of activities, number of subjects and accuracy.
35
3.1.
Residential healthcare monitoring systems
Seminal work by Bao and Intille in 2004 [110] used 5 bi-axial accelerometers, with
a sampling rate of 76.25 Hz to collect data from 20 participants performing a range of
20 activities.
These were selected to reflect common everyday activities at a variety
of intensity levels and included, reading, walking, brushing teeth and folding laundry.
Both a semi-naturalistic collection protocol and a more controlled collection procedure
were used for the experiments.
Mean, energy, entropy and correlation features were
created from the accelerometer data.
These were used with decision tables, instance-
based learning (nearest neighbour),
C4.5 decision trees and naive Bayes classifiers
to perform activity recognition.
It was found that the highest recognition accuracy
was achieved with the decision tree classifiers, with an overall accuracy rate of 84%,
followed by the nearest neighbour algorithm.
The results also demonstrated that a
high recognition accuracy, comparable with previous works in a controlled laboratory
environment, was achieved with data collected using the semi-naturalistic protocol.
Using multiple sensors is not always realistic for real-world long term monitoring as
users can find the devices obtrusive.
In contrast to Bao and Intille, Wang et al. [111]
used a single waist worn tri-axial accelerometer with a hidden Markov model (HMM)
based method to classify six different human daily activities.
Data was collected, at a
sampling rate of 50 Hz, for 13 healthy subjects, aged 26 to 50 years, who were asked
to perform the following activities:
falling, jumping, running, sitting down, standing
and walking.
A subset of the data collected from the accelerometer was used to train
a HMM for each of
the six activities.
Different parameters were investigated and
tested on the unseen data.
It was found that the highest recognition accuracy of
94.8% was achieved with 7 hidden states and 3 mixture components.
Furthermore,
it was found that the most likely activities to be misclassified are sitting and falling,
this is likely to be because from the point of
view of
accelerometer data sitting is
similar to a controlled fall.
Combining data from wearable sensors with other sources of
information,
such
as cameras and motion detectors can improve the accuracy of
activity recognition
[60,112].
Peetom et al. [112] conducted a systematic document search of key databases
for articles related to monitoring technologies for detecting activities of daily living
and significant events,
with a specific focus on independent living of
the elderly in
their homes.
They identified five types of
monitoring technologies,
including the
use of
body-worn sensors.
They summarise the 26 articles found in this category
in a table,
focussing on the aim of
the monitoring,
study characteristics and main
outcomes.
Furthermore, they also found 31 articles that utilise a combination of the
five technologies highlighted.
In particular, 5 papers combined body-worn sensors and
passive infra-red (PIR) motion sensors, this was the second most frequent combination
after video and PIR.
However,
the majority of
these papers described validation
36

Residential healthcare monitoring systems
studies in a laboratory environment.
Although it did not match the criteria of the search conducted by Peetoom et al.,
one key project that combines different types of sensors, not yet discussed in this re-
view, is the Opportunity Project [113].
They used a highly instrumented environment
to collect a dataset of complex,
naturalistic activities of
daily living.
The environ-
ment was set up in a room and designed to mimic a studio flat.
Participants were
asked to follow a high-level script of activities but were free to interpret and perform
them as they would normally, to capture natural variations between participants.
A
total of 72 sensors of 10 different modalities were utilised, including wearable sensors,
environmental
sensors and sensors attached to specific objects of interest,
such as a
knife.
A subset of the collected data was released as an open source dataset that can
be used for benchmarking different approaches and techniques [114].
In particular, as
part of an activity recognition challenge that was held in 2011 based on this dataset,
baseline performance of standard classification techniques were provided [114].
These
were k-Nearest Neighbour, Nearest Centroid Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis
and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
The tasks in this challenge included multi-
modal activity recognition of 4 modes of locomotion e.g.
walking and 17 gestures e.g.
open drawer.
Finally, the SPHERE project, with which this PhD was associated, held a similar
challenge in 2016 [115].
However, the data was collected in a real house environment
rather than simulated.
Participants were asked to follow a set of scripted activities
and also record naturalistic activities that were not scripted.
The dataset included
raw signals from a wrist-worn accelerometer and PIR sensors,
as well
as bounding
box and centre of mass features from RGB-D cameras (no raw video data was used
for privacy reasons).
The main aim was to predict posture (e.g.
sitting),
transition
(e.g.
sit to stand) and ambulation e.g.
(walking) labels for every second of
the
dataset.
A total of 20 labels, across all 3 categories were used to annotate the data.
The winning competition entry [116]
used a location-based hierarchical
approach
and temporal activity consistency for classification.
This performed better than the
baseline features, with a micro-f1 score of 0.76 reported.
However, this approach may
not perform as well on non-scripted activities as there is likely to be more variation
in location-activity relationships and the temporal
order of
activities recorded in a
free-living scenario.
The use of wearable sensors for activity recognition has received a lot of attention
from a variety of research communities.
Advances in low-power, low-cost and minia-
turised sensors and improvements in wireless communication technologies have made
the application of
wearable technology a reality.
The quantity and complexity of
data produced presents significant challenges in terms of exploiting its full potential.
37
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
Real world systems have many requirements that often constitute a direct trade off.
For example wearing multiple sensors can provide a much more accurate picture of
a person’s activities and movement but are an inconvenience to wear and recharge.
If the extra level of detail gained makes a significant improvement on the quality of
life for an individual
with a complex,
chronic disease the benefits can outweigh the
disadvantages.
However, for others simply measuring activity intensity from a single
wrist worn device may be sufficient.
Similarly,
the choice of algorithms depends on
the overall data fusion architecture selected, the accuracy required, power consump-
tion and processing time.
These choices have to made in the context of the target
application.
Data fusion from different types of sensors can help to find suitable com-
promises by combining the advantages of different modalities to provide additional
context and detail.
3.2
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
Section 3.1 demonstrated that there has been a large amount of research into analysing
data that could be generated by a residential healthcare monitoring system with the
goal
of recognising various activities.
The level
of granularity at which these activ-
ities are detected varies from very short,
specific gestures to longer,
more complex
activities.
However,
they are all
at a lower level
of data fusion than behaviour pat-
terns and daily routines.
Detecting these higher level
patterns facilitates long term
monitoring and identification of changes in behaviour or health status.
This can aid
early diagnosis, enable more effective management of chronic conditions and improve
quality of life [3, 11, 19, 24, 26].
In comparison to activity recognition, there has been
little research in higher level
patterns and changes over time,
which many authors
have suggested as important avenues of future research [62, 63, 101, 102, 112, 117, 118].
Daily routine discovery is looking for higher level
patterns in a person’s daily
activities that correspond to their routine.
For example, a lunch routine could consist
of:
walking,
preparing food,
cooking,
eating and washing up.
Each routine involves
a combination of different activities in varying proportions.
Some activities will
be
very specific to a particular routine, such as working at desk, which is most likely to
be in the work routine.
Other activities, such as using the toilet will occur in many
different routines.
There are several
methods for detecting someone’s daily routine
from various types of data.
Previous work reported in the literature,
is highlighted
and discussed here.

Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
3.2.1
Using topic models to detect routines
One method for detecting daily routines is to use topic models (Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) and variations),
which were introduced in chapter 2.
In order to
use topic models for an alternative purpose the concept of the generative model needs
to be translated to the new application domain.
For instance,
the daily activities,
such as eating, can be equivalent to the words in a document and the routines, such
as lunch,
equivalent to the topics.
For continuous data,
the documents are usually
specific length time slices,
such as 30 minutes,
and the entire dataset is equivalent
to the corpus.
As for activity recognition, the source of sensor data used with topic
models for discovering daily routines can vary.
This section reviews the work done in
this area using (global) location data, wearable sensor data and environment sensor
data, including local location data within a building.
Studies based on data collected
from video cameras is not considered here, as this is not the focus of this thesis.
3.2.1.1
Location data as input
A person’s daily routine can be detected from data about their location over time.
For example,
Ferrari
and Mamei
[119]
used data from Google Latitude,
a mobile
phone application that collects location information,
to look at patterns in people’s
global movement.
Data was collected for 2 people over nearly a one year period and
preprocessed to discover and label
relevant places for each user,
such as home and
work.
Using these labels and a label
to indicate a time-slot within the day,
a bag-
of-words representation of the data was created and used as the input to LDA. The
resulting topics were analysed and shown to be effective at identifying users’ routine
behaviours in terms of locations.
Farrahi and Gatica-Perez [120, 121] also consider using location data from mobile
phones to discover daily routines.
They use a much larger dataset, the Reality Mining
Dataset from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT),
with 97 users over a
period of 16 months,
although some days are discarded due to having no reception.
They use a similar bag-of-words representation based on specific locations, as done by
Ferrari
and Mamei.
In addition to discovering location-driven routines using LDA,
they also use Author-Topic Models, described in section 2.3.2, to identify how routines
vary between users.
The routines found from this type of input data, such as ‘going
to work late’,
are not very specific as this simply summarises a transition between
locations during a given time range.
In comparison,
a routine such as ‘commuting
to work’, summarises more detailed information e.g.
modes of transportation, about
the activities involved, for example ‘walking’, ‘waiting for bus’ and ‘travelling on bus’.
39
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
The more generic routines are used to determine overall behaviour patterns in users
and groups of users but only reflect significant changes in geographical location.
A topic model variant was also applied to the MIT Reality Mining dataset more
recently by Nabaei et al. [122].
However, they focus on robustly detecting anomalous
patterns,
with a focus on security and fraud applications.
Topic models are learnt
for each behaviour and the results are used as a user profile which represents normal
behaviour.
Gradual
changes are distinguished from abrupt ones and the model
pa-
rameters are updated to reflect the normal variation over time.
The model was also
applied to a dataset of Brazilian medical hospital records to detect fraudulent insur-
ance claims.
The results demonstrated that this method performed well for datasets
with a large number of unique attributes.
Furthermore,
Steinhoff and Schiele [123]
use data from GSM (Global
System for
Mobile Communications) and Bluetooth as an input to LDA to discover daily rou-
tines.
It is found that although topics can be discovered from this data,
Bluetooth
environments are unstable and GSM traces are too static for long periods, hence it is
likely that more interesting results would be obtained when combining this with other
sensors.
Although the ideas from these studies can be applicable,
the data sources
considered are not suitable for smaller geographical
areas,
such as in a residential
environment,
as required for the SPHERE project.
Moreover,
they do not provide
detail of the specific activities included in the user’s routine and hence do not directly
add useful
information for healthcare monitoring applications.
They could be used
in conjunction with other techniques to provide context, such as how often someone
eats out or visits the gym.
3.2.1.2
Wearable sensor data as input
Huynh et al. [32] used topic models to discover daily routine patterns in accelerometer
data.
They collected 7 days of
data from one person wearing two accelerometers.
The user annotated their daily routines and the detailed activities that made up
these routines.
A hierarchical
approach was taken to analyse the data,
with both
supervised and unsupervised methods.
Firstly,
the raw sensor data was classified
into activities.
The classifier results were then used as the input to a topic model
by creating documents of 30 minutes of activity data.
The results showed that the
topic models were able to identify topics that correlated well with the ground truth
daily routine labels.
Further details of
the collection and analysis of
the dataset
(UbiComp08) are given in section 4.1.
Seiter
et al.
[124]
investigated how different
characteristics of
a daily activity
dataset can affect the performance stability of a topic model.
They simulated datasets
40
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
with specific properties based on the original UbiComp08 dataset collected by Huynh
et al.
A three layered simulation model was defined to sample the daily routines and
the activity primitives of which they are composed.
The different datasets were used
as an input to LDA and the results compared.
As the number of
topics does not
necessarily match the number of routines, a k-Nearest Neighbours classifier was used
to map the topics to routines.
Details of the key dataset properties found for stable
performance of the topic model are discussed in section 4.2.1.
Furthermore, Seiter et al. [125] also considered the performance of three variations
of topic models on different datasets, including UbiComp08, benchmarked against a
baseline method using k-means clustering.
The approaches included LDA,
n-gram
topic models, which add primitive sequence information and correlated topic models,
which explicitly model the relationship between topics, as discussed in section 2.3.2.
Seiter et al.
define four properties that describe the complexity of a dataset; averaged
primitive rate,
activity composite specificity,
activity primitive sequence similarity
and composite-instance ratio.
The three datasets analysed all contain activity prim-
itives and composites, however they vary in terms of their properties.
After pre and
post processing the results showed that overall
LDA had the best performance on
all datasets, even when noise was introduced.
Moreover, it was noted that LDA had
a greater advantage over the baseline for datasets with a lower activity composite
specificity.
This is likely to be due to the underlying assumption of the LDA model
that documents exhibit multiple topics.
The results also demonstrated that good
choices for segment size and the number of
topics are close to the weighted mean
durations and expected number of activity composites respectively.
More recently,
Seiter et al.
[126]
evaluated the use of LDA for daily routine dis-
covery in hemiparetic rehabilitation patients.
Data was collected for 11 patients in
a daycare centre using six wearable sensors,
although only data from three were re-
quired for analysis.
Ground truth labels were annotated for six daily routines for each
patient for up to 10 days.
An unsupervised hierarchical approach was used to detect
the routines.
The activity vocabulary used as input to LDA is created using either
k-means clustering or a rule-based approach based on features extracted from the raw
sensor data.
The final step to map the discovered topics to the ground truth labels for
evaluation uses a supervised k-nn classifier.
The results revealed that the rule-based
approach performed best, with an average accuracy of 76% across patients.
This sug-
gests that the inclusion of expert knowledge is beneficial.
However, this may be due
to the structured scenario of
a rehabilitation centre where specified routines are of
interest.
In a free-living home environment, the discovery of new routines that have
not been identified a priori could provide as much or more insight into the patient’s
health status than known routines.
For example,
the model
may identify a routine
41
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
where the user has an increased level of sedentary or active behaviour in comparison
with their usual behaviour, that they would not have considered as a routine if asked.
By discovering this routine and understanding why the patient was not conscious of
it can provide an insight into how to approach changing the patient’s behaviour to
improve their health and well-being.
Spina et al. [12] conducted a similar study to Seiter et al. [126] but for patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
However,
their dataset was much
larger, including 977 COPD patients and 66 healthy controls from studies across 10
countries worldwide.
The physical activity of participants was recorded using a com-
mercial
wearable sensor which provides estimates of energy expenditure,
metabolic
equivalent of tasks, step count and sleep status for at least 4 days.
Moreover, Spina
et al.
took a different approach to constructing the vocabulary, using a complex data-
driven methodology based on activity intensity categories (IC) and relevant features
such as skin temperature, sleep count and accelerometer data.
The resulting routines
were distributions over the vocabulary and were interpreted by considering the IC to
which they were most related.
The results showed that the probability of routines
inferred over a day varies between different cohorts of
patients with varying levels
of
disease severity.
These routines have the potential
to be used as biomarkers in
diagnostic decision support systems and daily feedback from a monitoring system.
The results of this approach are well aligned with the target application but do not
provide any information about the activities performed and hence are not necessarily
transferable to alternative conditions with different requirements.
Kim et al.
[127]
used low level
activities found from multi-modal
sensor data,
accelerometer and ECG,
as input to LDA.
They investigated the performance with
the KNOWME real-life dataset, which includes self-labelled high level activities and
the corresponding sensor data for 12 subjects in free-living settings.
The results
reported show that, for a model with 30 topics, all of the labelled high level activities
are assigned to only one or two topics.
This suggests that this method is not suitable
for this dataset.
It is likely that this is due to several
factors,
including the limited
number of low level
activities (9) and short duration used to create documents (10
mins) in comparison to the reported durations of self-labelled activities.
This would
mean that the input does not provide enough detail to discriminate between different
types of
high level
activities and documents would be unlikely to exhibit multiple
topics as assumed by LDA.
A combination of wearable sensors, including accelerometers and physiological sen-
sors, were used by Peng et al. [128] to find complex activities following a hierarchical
approach.
They used k-means clustering on features from the acceleration data to
create words as input for LDA. The resulting topics were fused with the physiological
42
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
features at the classifier level.
A modified stacking framework method was applied
with the J48 decision tree as a base classifier and multinomial logistic regression for
the meta classifier.
The authors compared their results with a range of other methods,
including the original
work by Huynh et al.
They demonstrated that their method
outperformed the others overall
in terms of
the F-score.
However,
this is likely to
be because the parameters they used were chosen to be optimal
for the proposed
method.
In particular,
they applied the approach of Huynh et al.
using only 8 low
level activity labels that are not well aligned to discriminate between the higher level
activities.
Moreover, the final stage of this method relies on supervised learning and
hence labelled data is required for training, which is challenging to obtain.
Sun et al. [129] developed a two phase non-parametric framework for human rou-
tine discovery.
The first phase creates artificial words from features using a Dirichlet
process Gaussian mixture model,
allowing the size of the activity vocabulary to be
found automatically.
These words are grouped into documents and input to the sec-
ond phase,
a hierarchical
Dirichlet process (HDP),
enabling the optimal
number of
latent topics to be discovered by the model.
The resulting document topic propor-
tions are clustered using the affinity propagation algorithm to find high level routines,
without specifying the number of routines in advance.
The framework was tested on
two public datasets:
the UbiComp08 dataset and a transportation mode dataset from
Microsoft Research Asia.
The results demonstrated that the non-parametric frame-
work performed comparably to parametric models, such as LDA, with the advantage
of not needing to choose parameters.
This is useful because there is no obvious way
to select the optimal parameters.
A non-parametric approach to routine detection was also considered by Nguyen
et al. [130], with a focus on the intensity of physical activity based on accelerometer
data.
They use a HDP to infer the number of physical activity levels automatically
from the accelerometer data.
The discovered mixture proportions of activity levels
are used as features for a multi-label classifier.
The resulting classifications are then
compared to the daily routine of
the user.
In order to test the framework a new
dataset was collected for 13 people during working hours over a period of 3 weeks,
using the accelerometer in the Sociometric Badge,
a device originally developed by
the MIT Media Lab.
Experience sampling was used to collect the ground truth labels,
as it is thought that this reduces the bias in the data collection [130].
However, over
the 3 week period only 201 10-minute blocks of labelled data were collected across 13
people.
This is an average of approximately 2.5 hours per person, which is not very
indicative of
a long term routine.
Furthermore,
the users could only select from 6
activity labels and 2 of these were never chosen, hence there is little detail available.
Zhu et al.
[131]
used sticky hierarchical
Dirichlet process hidden Markov model

3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
(HDP-HMM),
a non-parametric Bayesian model,
to segment and cluster raw ac-
celerometer data at different levels of granularity.
This approach has the advantage
of
automatically determining the number of
clusters as it is non-parametric.
The
authors compared this method to LDA and reported that sticky HDP-HMM had
lower entropy-based error values for the ground truth segmentations.
However,
the
reported results are for a small
dataset,
one working day of data for 3 participants
with only 5 labelled ground truth labels.
Moreover,
LDA was applied in a different
context to that of the cited work of Huynh et al. [32]; determining activities directly
from accelerometer features and location data,
as opposed to detecting routines in
activity data.
Insufficient detail
of the application of LDA for this dataset is given
and the conclusions drawn are thus very limited.
The studies described here have demonstrated that wearable sensor data used as
input to different types of topic models is a promising avenue of research for detect-
ing daily routines.
The characteristics of the data must be carefully selected to align
with the assumptions of the model, such as exhibiting multiple topics in a document
and the target application.
Extensions to LDA,
such as hierarchical
Dirichlet pro-
cesses have demonstrated the potential to enhance the method by offering additional
advantages,
such as automatically determining the number of
topics.
This field of
research is still in its infancy and offers scope for expansion in several directions.
3.2.1.3
Environmental sensor data as input
Binary environmental sensor data is investigated by Rogers et al. [132], who apply a
hierarchical,
iterative approach to using LDA for activity discovery.
They evaluate
this method on the SCARE corpus, which has been adapted from the original purpose
of situated dialogues to produce an event stream.
These events related to activities
that were carried out in a virtual environment, following a list of tasks and no detailed
information of
the activities are provided.
Although this dataset offers the benefit
of having ground truth labels,
it is not very realistic in comparison to a free-living
real world environment.
The results demonstrate that patterns of events in the data
at different levels of
abstraction can be found.
A visualisation of
these patterns is
presented,
however no semantic interpretation is considered and it is not clear how
useful these results are for human users.
Rieping et al.
[133]
considered a different approach by altering the LDA model
to combine both the clustering of
the sensor data and detection of
routines into
one model.
They tested their novel
approach on data collected from PIR sensors,
reed and contact switches installed in 5 houses for at least 63 days.
They included a
preprocessing step that grouped the sensors into 5 key locations and used the number
44
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
of activations in each location and time of day as features.
The results showed that
their models outperformed the baseline LDA model
on this dataset and they state
that meaningful routines are found.
However, the interpretation of these routines is
not obvious and would not be suitable for end users of a monitoring system.
Moreover,
by only considering the location of the sensors a lot of detail is lost, for example just
because someone enters the bathroom it does not necessarily mean they used the
toilet.
Whereas if
it was known that a flush sensor had been activated this would
provide a much higher level of certainty.
A different approach to creating artificial words from binary PIR data is applied by
Castanedo et al. [134], similar to that used by Farrahi and Gatica-Perez for global lo-
cation data.
Each word represents a 5 minute sensor activation pattern for a specified
sensor, in a given time slot.
Documents are then created using the data for one room
over one day per document.
This method is evaluated on two long-term datasets, 50
and 90 weeks, collected in office environments.
Measuring the average perplexity for
a 10-fold cross validation suggested that using 100 and 1000 topics on each dataset
respectively gave the best fit.
The results are interpreted to demonstrate patterns of
behaviour in terms of office occupancy.
However, the interpretation is very involved
and the data is still of a high dimension.
Further processing is required to determine
useful information from these results.
One improvement could be to reduce the size of
the vocabulary which contains 38,880 and 83,520 words for each dataset respectively.
Finally,
for completeness it should be noted that topic models have also been
applied to find activities at a lower level.
In particular,
Chikhaoui
et al
[135]
used
sequential patterns of sensor events as inputs to LDA to find activities.
The method
was evaluated on 5 datasets,
including 2 from the CASAS project,
and shown to
be a successful
method for unsupervised activity recognition.
Chen et al.
[136]
also
utilised the CASAS dataset to evaluate their method using a modified LDA model
where each document corresponds to only one activity.
The documents are created
by segmenting the data based on location.
LDA is used as an intermediate step by
Rai et al. [137] to create features, together with other techniques, that are then used
as input to a support vector machine.
Raw data is collected from an accelerometer in
a smartphone and two different data fusion frameworks are evaluated.
Ihianle et al.
have considered using a simple topic model, probabilistic latent semantic analysis, on
two datasets created from environmental
sensors [138, 139]
for activity recognition.
Moreover,
they enhanced this method using domain knowledge extracted from the
web.
It has been found that the routines detected by topic models using environmental
sensors as input tend to be difficult to interpret and require further processing in
order to extract useful information.
These results could be improved by including a
45

Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
wider range of environmental sensors rather than focussing on location data generated
by movement sensors.
Furthermore, the results could be fused with data from other
types of sensors to provide additional
context and enhance the level
of information
obtained.
Using topic models as an activity recognition method has been shown to
be successful.
This suggests that a hierarchical approach to topic modelling could be
an interesting avenue for research to create a model that can work with raw data and
provide results at multiple levels of abstraction.
3.2.2
Other methods applied to the detection of behaviour
patterns
3.2.2.1
Detecting daily routines
In addition to using topic models, work has been done to discover daily routines us-
ing other methods.
For example, Zheng et al. [140] explored the use of collaborative
filtering to identify representative routine patterns for individuals even if only sparse
mobile phone data is available,
such as the location of
the user when they make
a phone call.
As with some of
the previous studies using topic models,
this work
considers daily routines at a high level
based on locations of
interest,
however the
technique proposed could be applied to other datasets.
The intuition behind collab-
orative filtering is that there are only a few different behaviour routines people can
have and hence given many users’
data there will
be a large number of other users
with similar routines.
Details of
the algorithms used can be found in [140].
This
approach would be most suitable for large, sparse datasets.
The MIT Reality Mining dataset, to which Farrahi & Gatica-Perez and Nabaei et
al.
applied topic models to discover daily routines,
was also analysed by Eagle and
Pentland,
who collected the original
dataset [141].
They used principle component
analysis to identify the top characteristic vectors that they term eigenbehaviours
[142].
Similarly,
the routines found using this approach are at a very high level,
such as working late or sleeping in.
Eagle et al.
consider both routines found for a
given individual
and also routines associated with an affiliated group of individuals
within the dataset,
such as business school
students.
This approach works well
for
a large,
longitudinal
dataset where the aim is to characterise behaviours and social
interactions at a high level
as it provides a large reduction in dimensionality of the
data.
However, for the purpose of providing data to support healthcare and well-being
requirements, too much detail of an individual’s activities would be lost.
The Bluetooth proximity data in the MIT Reality Mining dataset was investi-
gated by Azam et al.
to determine human behaviour routines [143].
They applied an
46
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
n-grams technique to identify the longest repeated patterns of
proximal
Bluetooth
devices detected by a specific user.
Different levels of
variance were considered to
account for anomalies in patterns, such as detecting a visitor’s Bluetooth device and
the frequency of
patterns in defined time slots were explored.
This work was then
extended by also considering a correlation matrix of the repeated patterns discovered
to remove sub-patterns that are not unique [144].
However although frequently oc-
curring patterns were highlighted for one user, no interpretation of these patterns is
attempted and it is not clear how useful these results are.
A prototype of
the University of
Virginia smart house monitoring system intro-
duced in section 3.1.3, was installed in a volunteer’s residence over 12 weeks [145].
The
sensor data was analysed using mixture models,
an unsupervised learning method,
to detect clusters of sensor firings.
A set of performance metrics were used to estab-
lish the most significant clusters and it was found that these corresponded to event
patterns or routines,
such as waking up.
The authors suggest that this method can
be used to determine a baseline of normal
activity for an individual.
However,
the
level of correspondence between the clusters and activities is not clear and has only
been investigated for one participant.
Additionally, using an unsupervised technique
for the discovery of routines directly from raw sensor data offers the advantage of not
requiring training data but results in a loss of detail.
Li
et al.
[146]
proposed a method of
discovering a flowgraph relating to a per-
son’s movement patterns around the home from motion sensor data.
Probabilistic
deterministic finite automata are learnt,
using the Alergia algorithm,
to create the
flowgraph, from which subflows corresponding to an activity are extracted by apply-
ing a weighted kernel k-means algorithm.
The identified subflows are mapped to the
floor plan of
the environment and labelled according to their correspondence with
the ground truth.
Further analysis using the method introduced by Eagle et al. [142]
is used to determine the eigenbehaviours.
Li et al.
suggest that these correspond to
different routines, however interpreting these results to provide useful information is
still unintuitive.
Motion patterns were also considered by Yin et al.
[147],
who took a top-down
approach to discovering daily routines and then room-level
activities.
Rather than
directly using the sensor names as done by Li
et al.,
the location of motion sensors
e.g.
kitchen,
are used to model
transitions through a living environment.
Markov
chains are used to model
these transitions for each one hour time interval and then
merged using a hierarchical
clustering approach to find daily routine patterns,
such
as morning routine.
The example Markov chains intuitively correspond to feasible
location patterns, however no validation of the method is provided.
47
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
A data mining approach was taken by Lin et al.
[148],
who extracted frequent
sequential
patterns at the activity and routine level.
However,
the method appears
to rely on the raw sensor data already being labelled.
Moreover,
it is not shown
how the resulting association patterns between activities can be used.
It is not clear
if this method could be applied to new raw sensor data to estimate what activities
and routines are being conducted.
Data mining techniques have also been considered
as part of the CASAS project.
In particular,
Rashidi
et al.
developed a novel
fre-
quent sequence miner algorithm, discontinuous varied-order mining, for unsupervised
activity recognition that allows for discontinuities and order variation within the se-
quences [96].
They extended the method to be used with streamed sensor data from
real
life smart apartments,
enabling automatic discovery of
activity patterns over
time [149].
This provides information for the routine of each individual,
which can
then be used to look for trends in behaviour.
The methods were evaluated and shown
to work well on several datasets, both scripted activities and free living [96, 149].
Blanke and Schiele took an alternative view of
the challenge to recognise daily
routines, based on activity spotting to reduce the amount of data required to classify
routines [150].
They demonstrated that a joint boosting framework that uses low-
level activity spotters as weak classifiers can reliably discriminate between high level
routines.
This was evaluated on the UbiComp08 dataset,
collected by Huynh et
al. [32],
showing that using less than 3% of the original
data still yielded recall and
precision rates over 80% for the routines.
This approach is very useful for improving
computational
efficiency,
however it suffers from a loss of
data which could reveal
important data to clinicians.
In particular,
it only identifies discriminative features
for each routine rather than providing information about the underlying structure.
The methods presented here for detecting daily routines tend to be based on
location data and/or have a lack of
detail
about activities performed.
The most
comparable method to topic models is the work of
Rashidi
et al.
which discovers
activity patterns that correspond to daily routines, whilst allowing for discontinuities
and interleaved activities.
The patterns are found from raw sensor data and therefore
still
require additional
knowledge of the system architecture and layout in order to
interpret the routines.
It is not possible to make direct comparisons between these
approaches as they have been applied to datasets with very different characteristics.
3.2.2.2
Detecting changes over time
Rather than following a hierarchical approach and looking for routines that are con-
structed from a series of activities, some researchers have pursued the idea of using the
activities found from sensor data to investigate changes over time.
This varies from
48
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
considering overall trends in activity levels to focussing on the patterns for a specific
activity of interest, such as using the toilet.
This high level overview of changes over
time can often be presented in a more accessible form to key stakeholders,
such as
clinicians and caregivers.
However,
interesting data about which activities make up
a routine may be lost by taking this approach.
Derungs et al. [151] conducted an exploratory analysis of trends in wearable sensor
data from stroke patients, from the dataset collected by Seiter et al. [126] described
in section 3.2.1.2.
The results showed that leg movement and sit to walk duration
ratios demonstrated the strongest trends over time.
There was still a lot of variability
between patients,
with both positive and negative trends discovered.
It is not clear
from this analysis whether the results correspond with clinical observations of progress
levels in each patient’s recovery and hence how useful they are for clinicians.
The prediction of long term functional health status using environmental sensors,
particularly passive infra-red (PIR), has been considered by Robben et al. [152, 153].
Two case studies of elderly participants,
living independently,
with monitoring sys-
tems installed in their homes are presented in [152].
An exploratory analysis of
detected location in the house over time and the application of principal component
analysis are considered and compared against various health metrics taken every 3
months,
used as ground truth.
Although these approaches can help to highlight
trends in behaviours that can be linked with health outcomes, the results still require
interpretation, which is not feasible for clinicians or caregivers.
This work is extended
in [153] and moves towards addressing this limitation.
A regression based approach is
utilised in order to automatically select features which are discriminative for different
health metrics and represent common concepts for assessing health status e.g.
time
spent in the living room in the evening.
The results show that using features based
on changes in measurements yields more accurate results than the static values.
Long term datasets collected at TigerPlace have also been used to investigate be-
haviour patterns as an early indicator of
health decline.
One technique proposed
was linguistic summarisation,
which enables numerical
data to be presented using
quasi-natural
language phrases [154].
This method is based on fuzzy logic calculus
of
linguistically quantified propositions,
such as,
‘on some nights the resident had
high restlessness’.
This methodology allows for uncertainty in the data and provides
results in an easily interpretable format for key stakeholders, such as clinicians.
Con-
versely this leads to a reduction in sensitivity to changes and details which may be
of clinical importance.
A 15 month case study presented for one 80 year old resident
demonstrates that contextual knowledge, such as medical procedures undertaken, is
very important when analysing the results.
This would be difficult to scale up for a
large population.

3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
Another approach considered, using the TigerPlace data, is dissimilarity compar-
ison of
activity density maps from different time points [155].
Activity density of
residents, calculated from the number of sensor firings, can be visualised with colours
representing different ranges of activity levels for each hour of the day over a month.
This quickly enables general patterns and trends to be seen.
A co-occurrence matrix
can be used to measure and quantify the dissimilarity between two maps,
based on
features related to the regularity of the activity data as well
as the average motion
density and time away from home.
The direction of changes is not directly reported
however.
Results from three case studies showed that observed trends could be linked
to health status.
Moreover,
health professionals found the maps useful
to support
their job and now use them regularly.
Detailed specific knowledge, such as when the
cleaner comes,
is still
required to interpret the maps as this causes a large increase
in the number of sensor firings.
More recently, a classification method was used to select features, extracted from
motion and bed sensor data collected at TigerPlace, most relevant to capturing early
health changes [156].
It was determined that features linked with bathroom visits,
sleep patterns and socialising were the most important.
These features were used to
create an automated health alert system based on comparison of sensor values with
a two week moving baseline, personalised for each person.
High thresholds were used
for the alerts, resulting in approximately 50% false alarms.
The clinical relevance of
all
of the alerts generated were rated by clinicians to provide a ground truth.
One
domain knowledge based machine learning algorithm and three supervised learning
algorithms, with different feature spaces, were compared to automatically determine
the relevance of
alerts.
The results demonstrated the fuzzy pattern tree method,
based on domain knowledge performed the best on a dataset of
21 residents for
one year.
The system enabled the early detection of a variety of health conditions,
including urinary tract infections,
heart failure,
delirium and hypoglycemia.
This
method works well
for TigerPlace residents but may not transfer directly to the
wider population.
The idea of
an activity curve was introduced by Dawadi
et al.
[157]
as part of
the CASAS project.
It models the probability distributions of
a specified set of
activities at different times of
day for a whole day.
Minor day-to-day variations
in the timing of routines are accounted for by aggregating activity curves within a
window of a few days.
Longer term changes are discovered by comparing the curves
at different time points using the proposed algorithm;
a permutation-based two-
sample test with a distance metric of symmetric Kullback-Liebler divergence.
This
method was validated on a synthetic dataset with known changes and evaluated on
real
long term smart home data from 18 participants aged 73 or older.
The results
50
3.2.
Detecting behaviour patterns in activity data
demonstrated a statistically significant correlation to the Timed Up and Go Test,
a
standard clinical
test for mobility based health but not the RBANS,
a measure of
cognitive health.
Continuous changes can also be detected and the results indicate
that larger variations can be associated with a decline in health [157].
The hierarchical
nature of
many activities was not considered and only a limited set of
labels was
utilised.
Extending this further could improve the correlations and provide more
useful information for healthcare providers.
Four case studies from the assisted living pilot at the University of Virginia were
analysed for behavioural
patterns [117].
The motion sensor data was used to de-
termine activity level
and amount of time spent in each room for each hour of the
day.
These features enabled estimation of
participant’s circadian activity rhythms
and their deviations.
It was demonstrated that this can be used to model behavioural
patterns and changes that may be consistent with disease onset.
This approach is
strongly linked with time of day and therefore may be less effective for populations
with a less structured and predictable routine.
Elbert et al.
[158]
also investigated deviations in circadian rhythms,
focusing on
people suffering from dementia.
Activities of daily living (ADLs) were detected from
sensor events using a combination of techniques, including case-based reasoning, rule-
based reasoning,
time maps and fuzzy logic.
Long-term behaviour monitoring is
achieved through a combination of
an activity score calculator,
sleep monitor and
circadian rhythm score (CRS) calculator,
which are used by a trend analyser to
detect critical changes in behaviour.
In particular, the CRS calculator is designed to
analyse a person’s daily routine giving a score from 0 to 1, representing the degree of
deviation from normal.
This is achieved through a combination of three approaches:
cosinor analysis based on the theory of circadian rhythms as a special representative
of
regression analysis;
a histogram-based approach based on movement data and a
probabilistic model of behaviour based on a person’s ADLs.
Details of these methods
are given in [158].
This approach appears to be very comprehensive,
however it is
not clear how much computation power is required and whether it would be feasible
to implement such a system outside of an ambient assisted living environment.
Changes in activity levels and patterns over time have been linked with clinical
outcomes in a variety of
studies.
The changes detected do not generally provide
specific details about the structure of
an individual’s routine,
rather they tend to
indicate variations in overall activity levels.
This information can be presented in a
usable and useful way to clinicians and caregivers.
This level of information may be
sufficient for certain applications,
but a greater level
of detail
about which routines
and activities are changing, the level and direction of the change could further exploit
the data collected, enhancing the benefit of a monitoring system.

Detecting behaviour patterns in nutrition
data
A residential healthcare monitoring system offers huge potential to collect a wealth of
data.
In addition to detecting activities of daily living from different sensors, nutrition
data can be gathered through the use of cameras and logging applications on mobile
phones [31, 159, 160].
Good nutrition is fundamental
to a healthy lifestyle [161]
and
many chronic diseases are related to diet [16].
Collecting data on food intake is
paramount for investigating associations between diet,
health and the occurrence
of disease [159].
Eating behaviours and patterns can be directly related to chronic
diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes [162–165].
This section reviews the state-of-the-art in technology based solutions for moni-
toring food intake that could be utilised in a residential
environment.
Background
information on the assessment of food intake at different levels is given.
In partic-
ular,
the concept of meal-based analysis is introduced and how this can be used to
explore the relationships between diet and health.
Finally,
the challenge of defining
different eating events, especially distinguishing between meals and snacks is consid-
ered.
Existing definitions used in the literature and qualities affecting perceptions
are highlighted.
More complex food based definitions are reviewed and the use of
machine learning algorithms to identify relevant food groupings is addressed.
3.3.1
Automated nutrition monitoring using sensors in a
residential environment
As cameras are already a proposed part of
many residential
healthcare monitoring
solutions, using them to detect food intake is a logical step.
He et al. [166] proposed
a classification approach based on k-nearest neighbours and vocabulary trees for
identifying images of foods consumed during an eating event, taken on a smart phone.
A classification accuracy of 64.5% was achieved for the most probable label given to
each segmented food item.
Ciocca et al. [167] recently presented a benchmark dataset
of real canteen trays, containing multiple instances of food items.
They developed an
automatic tray analysis pipeline and results showed approximately 79% accuracy of
food was achieved using convolutional-neural-networks-based features.
The idea of using cameras for dietary assessment was developed further by Dehais
et al.
[168]
who created a novel
system to calculate portion sizes using two images
from mobile devices.
The algorithmic framework presented enables 3D reconstruction
and volume estimation of various food items on a plate.
The results demonstrate this
52
3.3.
Detecting behaviour patterns in nutrition data
system is more accurate than existing solutions and user estimates.
However,
there
are currently several
limitations due to the requirements for input pictures,
type of
serving dish and the need for a size reference object in the image.
Furthermore, Liu
et al. [169] have considered how the use of images taken on mobile devices for dietary
assessment can be handled in a real-world scenario,
with a particular focus on real
time processing and low energy consumption,
whilst still
achieving state-of-the-art
recognition accuracy.
This was achieved through the use of deep learning algorithms
and the use of cloud based servers for processing.
In addition to detecting food intake in terms of what is consumed,
there is also
interest in eating behaviours,
such as choice of food and number of bites or chews.
There are a number of different sensing technologies that are being investigated.
The
aim is to reliably and unobtrusively gather information on what, how and when items
are consumed.
The state-of-the-art solutions currently focus on a specific aspect of
dietary monitoring, each offering unique advantages but still having severe limitations
[170, 171].
As technology and research in this area develops these innovations can be
integrated to provide a detailed automatic dietary monitoring system.
Some examples
of state-of-the-art solutions for monitoring eating behaviour are highlighted, a more
detailed review is beyond the scope of this thesis but can be found here [170].
A smart dining table was proposed by Manton et al.
[172]
to track eating be-
haviours during a meal.
They found that combining a wearable inertial measurement
unit with a multi-touch tabletop computer running Microsoft Surface performed bet-
ter than a kinect for detecting bites and which plate the food was taken from.
Zhou
et al. [171,173] also designed a smart table surface using a novel smart tablecloth with
a fabric based pressure matrix and a dining tray with pressure sensors on the feet.
This system enables detection of detailed dining-related activities such as scooping
and cutting, the type and weight of items consumed, including drinks.
Furthermore, a
novel algorithm to detect the weight of individual bites consumed during unrestricted
eating has been developed for use with a simple table embedded scale [174].
Table top sensor systems have the limitation of not being easily portable, whereas
wearable solutions can be used when eating in different situations,
such as on the
move or in front of the TV [170].
One wearable solution for detecting eating events
and chewing is to integrate electromyography electrodes into custom 3D printed eye-
glasses.
The glasses can be worn unobtrusively in a free living environment for a
full
day and can classify between different food types based on textures and hard-
ness [175,176].
Furthermore, the feasibility of fabric based sensors embedded in a shirt
collar to detect swallowing has also been demonstrated [177].
Inertial sensors worn on
the wrist can be utilised to detect eating events, similar to general activity recognition
discussed in section 3.1.4, but developing algorithms to be more specific [178].

Detecting behaviour patterns in nutrition data
3.3.2
Assessing and analysing dietary intake
Monitoring and assessing food and nutrient intake data for individuals is a complex
process.
There are a variety of different methods employed by scientists,
including
food diaries, 24-hour dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires.
Each method
has its own strengths and limitations and the most appropriate method depends
on the objectives of a study [179].
Understanding nutrient intake at both a macro
and micro level
is important for investigating links with health outcomes.
Food
composition or nutrient databases are used to calculate overall nutrient intake from
food consumption data, although these are not standardised and can be a significant
source of error, particularly when making comparisons across multi-national datasets
[180].
There are many benefits to considering food intake at the individual
food item
level, but the variety of items means it is difficult to use this level of information to
communicate with the public [181].
Similar items are often grouped together into
food groups,
such as puddings,
fruit and cheese.
These groups may then be split
further into subsidiary food groups, such as sponge puddings (manufactured), citrus
fruit not canned and cottage cheese [182].
These groupings are not standardised and
can vary in number and content between studies [182, 183].
Only considering food
items and the constituent nutrient content does not enable a full
analysis of
food
intake and associations with health outcomes,
often leading to conflicting findings
[184].
People often eat a variety of
food items together,
for example a sandwich
could consist of wholemeal bread, low-fat spread and cheddar cheese.
The interaction
between different foods and nutrients consumed together should also be considered
[181, 185].
Dietary pattern analysis has been utilised widely amongst the nutritional
epidemiology research community and related to chronic diseases [163, 164, 181].
Recently interest in understanding how the composition and patterns in the con-
sumption of meals impact the relationship between diet and disease has increased.
A
meals-based approach would complement existing dietary advice, which is given at a
food or nutrient level [181, 184].There are strong advantages to analysing food intake
at a meal level, however one key drawback is the difficulty in comparing results across
studies due to the variation in definitions of
meals and snacks [17, 18, 184, 186].
In
particular, studies that consider the impact of eating frequency on health outcomes,
such as obesity are highly inconsistent,
reporting a full
range of
inverse,
null
and
positive associations.
This is due to a variety of methodological problems:
choice of
assessment method;
adjustment for confounding factors;
under-reporting by certain
participants and the lack of consensus about what constitutes a snack, meal or eating
event [187, 188].
Similar challenges occur when investigating the impact of skipping

Detecting behaviour patterns in nutrition data
breakfast on cognitive performance and appetite control, particularly as the meaning
of breakfast is often subjectively interpreted by participants with no clear guidance
from researchers [189].
3.3.3
Defining eating events
3.3.3.1
Influence of language and culture on definitions of eating events
It is well understood that there is little consensus within the nutrition research com-
munity as to what constitutes a snack [17, 18, 190–193].
Furthermore,
the use of
different phrases with the root word ‘snack’, e.g.
snack food or snacking can cause a
large difference in interpretation by individuals [194].
Hess et al.
compare the rec-
ommendations relating to snacks,
snack foods and snacking from dietary guidelines
published by countries around the world.
The variety of language used demonstrates
the diversity of definitions for snacks and the challenges in communicating healthy
eating information to the public [191].
Moreove, this is further demonstrated in other
languages that have a much greater variety of words to describe eating events outside
of meals [193].
A variety of factors can affect the perception of what a snack is,
including time
of day, type of food, amount of food and level of hunger [17, 192].
Leech et al. [190]
compare a variety of definitions for eating events used in the literature.
This includes
participant defined labels, with five types of meals and four types of snack, including
a ‘beverage break’.
Other definitions are based on the time of day and energy content
of
eating events to distinguish them as meals or snacks,
with a maximum of
three
meals possible and all other events deemed as snacks.
The remaining six definitions
highlighted are neutral,
only defining an eating event,
using criteria related to time
interval
separation and minimum energy content,
but not distinguishing between
meals and snacks.
Another definition is based on contribution to the total
energy
intake (TEI) in a 24-hour period,
with those eating events providing greater than
15% of TEI considered a meal and those lower, a snack [195].
Johnson and Anderson propose a qualitative definition for snacks, excluding bev-
erages consumed alone [192]:
“A snack is composed of solid food(s), including those typically eaten with
a utensil (with or without a beverage) that occurs between habitual meal
occasions for the individual,
is not a substitute for a meal,
and provides
substantially fewer calories than would be consumed in a typical meal.”
This definition is based on identified characteristics from the literature,
but it is
55
3.3.
Detecting behaviour patterns in nutrition data
offered for initial
consideration and acknowledged that a collaborative effort among
all
relevant stakeholders is required [192].
Warde and Yates provide very insightful
analyses into types of eating events based on a survey of eating patterns conducted
in Great Britain in 2012, focussing both on snacks [193] and meals [196], including a
comparison with how meal content has changed since the 1950s.
They suggest that
the definition for a snack would have the following qualities [193]:
“Small portions of portable foods, easily prepared, and consumed casually
at simple and quick events.”
In addition,
a more specific definition has been proposed for breakfast by O’Neil
et al. [197]:
“Breakfast is the first meal of the day that breaks the fast after the longest
period of
sleep and is consumed within 2 to 3 hours of
waking;
it is
comprised of food or beverage from at least one food group, and may be
consumed at any location.”
Further guidance is also provided with regards to criteria for a quality breakfast in
terms of nutrient and energy balance.
St-Onge et al.
suggest combining this defini-
tion, with the definition based on TEI, to cover all eating events without referring to
the time of day, as it excludes subgroups of the population, such as shift workers [195].
Situational and environmental cues, such as eating alone or with others, can also
influence perception of
eating event classification [193, 196, 198].
Young children,
aged 4 to 6 years, are already learning associations between eating cues and the clas-
sification of eating events.
These eating habits can endure over time and therefore
influencing children’s perceptions from a young age could help to encourage a healthy
and well-balanced diet [199].
Younginer et al.
focussed specifically on snacks for chil-
dren from the perspective of low-income caregivers.
They highlighted five dimensions
that influence the definition of a snack, arising from semi-structured interviews:
type
of
items consumed,
portion size,
purpose of
eating event,
location and time,
both
time of day and time for preparation and consumption.
These resulted in a proposed
definition for a child’s snack [200]:
“A small portion of food that is given in-between meals, frequently with
an intention of reducing or preventing hunger until the next mealtime.”
3.3.3.2
Food based definitions of eating events
Beyond the use of participant defined labels, simple criteria, based on time of day and
energy content or qualitative descriptions, some studies have considered how foods are
56
3.3.
Detecting behaviour patterns in nutrition data
grouped together in eating events.
In 1999, Lennern¨
as and Andersson [201] proposed
a categorisation strategy for eating events based on combinations of food categories,
known as ‘food-based classification of
eating episodes’
(FBCE).
Rather than using
specified thresholds to define events,
this strategy first categorises different types of
eating events and then considers the mean energy and nutrient content.
Seven food
categories are given based on their nutritional
similarity,
such as ‘high fat density’.
A table of
criteria on how these categories are combined is used to determine the
type of
eating event,
from a list of
four meals and four snacks.
These are given
labels,
from ‘complete meal’,
through to ‘no energy snack’,
with examples provided
for each.
However,
this classification strategy has not been widely adopted by the
community [192], perhaps because it does not consider the other qualities and factors
associated with eating events.
More recently,
a food based classification method with detailed criteria for iden-
tifying eating events as meals,
snacks or drinks was developed to investigate the
association between restrained eating, total energy intake and obesity [202].
All food
groups recorded in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2000, excluding sup-
plements,
were allocated to meal,
snack and drink lists,
based on information from
the literature.
Eating events were considered to be all items consumed within every
60 minute period,
starting from the time of
the first record on each day for every
participant.
The following criteria were then applied to label
an eating event as a
meal, snack or drink:
Meal
All items from meal list OR
More than one item and at least one item from meal list EXCEPT
Two items only, one each from meal and snack lists (e.g.
bread and butter)
Snack All items from snack list OR
Two items only, one each from meal and snack lists
Drink All items from drink list OR
Two items only, one each from drink and snack lists (e.g.
sugar in coffee)
This method allows for common combinations of food items,
which are listed sepa-
rately in databases, to be categorised in the relevant group.
For example, an eating
event which only contains a coffee will
still
be labelled as a drink even if
there is
sugar in the coffee.
However,
this method still
has limitations,
for example a cup
of
tea where tea,
milk and sugar are listed separately would not meet the criteria
for the drink category.
This highlights the complexity of defining eating events and
the influence of underlying coding strategies used in databases on developing suitable
criteria.
57
3.3.
Detecting behaviour patterns in nutrition data
The concept of generic meals was introduced by Woolhead et al.
[181],
based on
common food group combinations that occurred in the Irish National Adult Nutrition
Survey (NANS).
The food items recorded in the survey were allocated to 20 food
groups and the recorded eating event labels were simplified to five types:
breakfast,
light meals, main meals, snacks and beverages.
Within each type, the most commonly
consumed food group combinations were identified, using a data-mining method based
on the concept of ‘frequent item sets’.
These food group combinations were considered
to represent generic meals,
such as ‘cereals and milk and juice’
and each assigned a
unique code.
A total of 63 generic meals were found across the full dataset, excluding
all supplement items.
Generally dietary patterns are used in nutrition research to identify trends in over-
all
dietary intake.
However,
this approach was used at the meal
level
for a dataset
of
food intake for Brazilian adults [203].
Three types of
breakfast were identified:
healthy,
traditional
and snack.
There were five types of
lunch:
traditional,
salad,
sweetened juice,
western and meats.
Finally,
for dinner four patterns were found:
coffee with milk and bread, transition, traditional and soup and fruits.
These group-
ings of foods could be useful for the specific population studied, however the current
naming conventions limit their use in different settings as they rely on assumptions
e.g what constitutes traditional and western.
Johnson et al.
[204]
investigated how foods are grouped based on individuals’
hedonic ratings of foods and the relationship to dietary intake.
Principle components
analysis (PCA) was used to determine the component structures of the food ratings.
For each component researchers reviewed the images and selected the following names
to describe the groups:
Energy dense Main Courses,
Fruits,
Meats,
Desserts,
Light
Main Courses, Seafood, and Grains.
These were compared to traditional food groups,
revealing that some groups were an exact match,
e.g.
fruits,
whereas others e.g.
energy dense main courses had a poor agreement due to a more complex mixture of
foods.
Notably, vegetables were not found to be a discernible component in the PCA.
Although this does not specifically focus on defining eating events, understanding how
individuals group foods in terms of appeal can help dietary guidelines be tailored to
have a greater impact on encouraging healthy eating.
As far as the author is aware, at the time of writing, machine learning algorithms
have not been directly utilised to investigate how foods are grouped together in
eating events.
However,
there has been interest in the use of
machine learning to
investigate eating patterns at a meal
level,
as opposed to a food item level.
Hearty
and Gibney [185] developed a 2-tiered coding system to represent types of meals based
on the foods consumed together.
These codes were used as the input to supervised
machine learning algorithms to predict a Healthy Eating Index score.
Khanna et

Chapter summary
al. [16] implemented kernel k-means clustering to identify temporal dietary patterns
in terms of
energy consumed.
Clustering was also adopted by Riou et al.
[205]
to
identify temporal patterns in meals for the population of Paris.
Participant defined eating events,
definitions based on simple criteria relating to
time of day and energy content or qualitative descriptions are inherently biased by
language and cultural
influences.
Some studies have utilised food based definitions,
which are linked with ideas on how foods are combined together in meals, rather than
relying on time or energy content.
This reduces some restrictive assumptions,
such
as snacks have a lower energy content than a meal.
However,
these definitions are
still subjective in nature due to the choice of categories for grouping foods.
The lack
of consistency between definitions used across studies poses a huge challenge when
analysing eating events to understand how different combinations of foods are linked
with diet quality and health outcomes.
Interdisciplinary collaborations and advances
in machine learning techniques have enabled the use of new methods to be applied to
nutrition research.
A data driven approach to understanding how foods are combined
could help to limit researcher bias and provide a standardised approach for analysing
eating events.

Chapter summary
This chapter has reviewed the literature related to the application of
data fusion
for healthcare monitoring in residential
environments.
The rich,
complex nature of
datasets that can be collected by a monitoring system consisting of a variety of sensors
has been highlighted.
Understanding these datasets and obtaining useful
informa-
tion for the end users was considered within the context of data fusion frameworks.
Research at the low and middle levels of data fusion,
in particular activity recogni-
tion has received a lot of attention and is a mature field of work.
A variety of the
techniques and algorithms employed were presented,
along with a discussion of the
advantages and limitations.
High level
data fusion for detecting behaviour patterns has received a lot less
attention in comparison to activity recognition and was identified as an important
area for further research.
Clinicians and caregivers have limited time available to
review data from a monitoring system on a regular basis and therefore summarising
information at a high level can improve the overall usability.
At the same time, it is
important not to disregard the detailed data at a lower level as this may need to be
referred to for specific situations.
Topic models were identified as a promising method
for detecting daily routines in activity data based on the work by Huynh et al. [32].
59
3.4.
Chapter summary
Topic models offer the advantage of finding the latent structure of routines based on
a series of activities.
Therefore a high level
summary is achieved at the same time
as retaining knowledge of the underlying details.
Furthermore, topic models assume
that activities can occur in any routine,
as opposed to clustering algorithms which
restrict each activity to be assigned to only one routine,
which is not reflective of
the real
world nature of activities.
The probabilistic nature of topic models is also
beneficial
as it represents and helps to quantify the uncertainty that is inherent in
complex, real data.
Extensions to the original topic model, LDA, have been implemented in a handful
of
studies related to activity and routine monitoring.
There has also been interest
in long term monitoring and detection of changes in behaviour patterns over time.
This information can aid early diagnosis and management of
chronic diseases,
im-
proving quality of life for patients.
However,
many techniques currently applied to
this challenge tend to focus on variations in overall activity levels and do not include
data about the underlying structure of routines.
Dynamic topic models (DTMs) have
been identified as a potential method to address this gap in the research.
DTMs can
model
changes in the structure of routines over time,
in terms of the probability of
the constituent activities.
This can reveal
more detailed information about how a
person’s behaviour varies with time.
In addition to activity data, a residential monitoring system can also be employed
to collect data related to other aspects of a person’s health and well-being.
In par-
ticular,
nutrition is highly correlated with a variety of
health outcomes and eating
behaviours can be directly linked with chronic diseases.
Therefore the application
of topic models to nutrition data was highlighted as a key research opportunity.
In
collaboration with a nutrition expert from the University of Bristol it was identified
that a large research challenge in the nutrition community is the lack of a clear def-
inition of
different eating events,
such as a snack.
This affects the analysis of
the
impact of different eating behaviours on health outcomes and makes comparisons of
results across studies difficult.
Topic models can provide a data driven approach to
understanding how different food groups are combined together in eating events.

An individual’s physical activity levels and ability to perform activities of daily living
are key indicators of
their health and well-being [3, 15, 206].
Monitoring these can
enable older adults and people with chronic conditions to maintain their independence
living at home for longer [23].
Moreover,
continuous monitoring of
activities in a
residential environment is important for early detection of disorders and deterioration
in health [3, 4].
Many machine learning algorithms have been applied to the task of
activity recognition and to a lesser extent, detecting behaviour patterns.
Topic models
have been identified as showing great potential for detecting routines in activity data,
offering the advantages of discovering the underlying structure, allowing activities to
occur in multiple routines and quantifying uncertainty in the data.
Several studies globally have collected datasets [62, 89, 90, 94, 97, 113, 118, 119, 141,
158,206–210] relating to human activities and daily routines.
However, the nature and
availability of these datasets varies greatly.
It is recognised that there is an important
need for realistic datasets to be publicly available, unfortunately there can be many
restrictions that mean this is not always possible.
In particular,
such datasets are
expensive and difficult to collect;
furthermore there can be ethical
constraints on
releasing data into the public domain.
Publicly available datasets allow researchers
to both validate other’s work and build on it,
including making direct comparisons
between the performances of different algorithms [206, 208].
This chapter describes the implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
to replicate the work of
Huynh et al.
using the UbiComp 08 dataset [32]
and the
results obtained are compared with those originally published.
Following on from the
analysis of
this previous work,
the requirements and collection of
a new dataset of
61
4.1.
UbiComp 08 dataset
daily activities, using a custom built smart phone app, are presented.
The results of
applying topic models to this novel dataset are analysed and discussed.
4.1
UbiComp 08 dataset
This section investigates the open UbiComp 08 dataset presented in Huynh et al. [32].
The aim is to verify the results given,
in particular the application of topic models
to activity data in order to find higher level
routines.
Routines are considered to
be a group of activities that often occur together, in varying orders and proportions
and tend to last a longer period of time than individual activities.
For example, the
routine ‘office work’
will
mostly involve the activity of
‘sitting/desk activities’
but
may also include activities such as ‘using the toilet’
and ‘standing /talking’.
The
UbiComp 08 dataset contains data from one person, wearing two accelerometers, one
on their right wrist and one in their right hand hip pocket, whilst carrying out their
normal activities of daily life.
The data was collected over a period of sixteen days,
during waking hours.
The sensors sampled at 100 Hz and this data was preprocessed
on the device using a sliding window of 0.4 seconds to give mean and variance features
at 2.5 Hz.
The user also annotated their daily routines and the detailed activities that
made up these routines,
throughout the collection period.
These annotations were
recorded using a combination of
methods,
including experience sampling,
a time
diary and camera snapshots.
After accounting for hardware failures and missing
annotations,
the final
dataset used for experiments included 84 hours across 7 non
consecutive days.
The data were analysed using a hierarchical
approach with both supervised and
unsupervised methods.
Firstly, the raw sensor data was classified into activities using
the mean and variance features, frequency features, and a time stamp.
Initially, three
supervised classification methods were evaluated,
support vector machines,
hidden
Markov models and Na¨ıve Bayes,
using the annotations for training.
Huynh et al.
found that the best method for this dataset was a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier and adding
the frequency features did not improve the results.
The classifier results were then
used as the input to a topic model
by creating documents of 30 minutes of activity
data using a sliding window,
shifted by 2.5 minutes each time.
Secondly,
it was
then demonstrated that the whole process could be unsupervised by using k-means
clustering to generate discrete labels from the accelerometer data.
These labels can
then be used as the vocabulary for the topic model [32].
The results showed that topic models can identify topics that correlate well with
the ground truth daily routine labels given by the user, both using the output from su-
62
4.1.
UbiComp 08 dataset
pervised and unsupervised classifiers.
Supervised techniques offer the advantage that
the topics found are immediately human-readable because they are constructed from
meaningful labels, such as walking.
On the other hand, unsupervised methods gener-
ate topics where the contents is a collection of cluster labels with no direct meaning.
However,
unsupervised methods have the significant advantage of
not requiring an
annotated dataset, which requires substantial effort and is not always accurate [32].
4.1.1
Applying LDA to activity data in UbiComp 08
dataset
Huynh et al.
used David Blei’s implementation of
variational
inference for LDA,
written in C [51], hence this was chosen in order to replicate their results as closely as
possible.
The C code was compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio and the executable
was called from a wrapper function in MATLAB to allow easy manipulation of both
the input data and the results.
The program has two main functions which can
be called.
The first one,
‘lda est’
estimates a topic model
which has the best fit
to the data i.e.
the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm described in section
2.2.2 is executed to determine the latent variables at the document and corpus level.
An option is selected to define whether the topic distributions should be initialised
randomly or smoothed from a randomly chosen document.
An initial value for
α
, the
Dirichlet hyperparameter for the per document topic proportions, and the number of
topics
K
must also be specified.
There is a settings file,
which can be altered as required.
This states whether to
make the initial value of
α
fixed or estimated as the model is learnt.
It also contains
settings to define the convergence criteria and maximum number of iterations that
should be executed for the variational EM algorithm and coordinate ascent variational
inference.
The second function,
‘lda inf’ performs variational inference on new data
using a previously estimated LDA model.
Again,
it uses a settings file to configure
the convergence criteria and maximum number of iterations.
In order to use activity data as an input to a topic model it needs to be split into
the equivalent of documents that make up a corpus.
The same approach as taken by
Huynh et al.
was used to make the results comparable.
The full list of all activities
is used as the vocabulary,
where an activity is the equivalent of a word.
To create
documents, a sliding window was applied to the dataset, where each window is a time
slice of data that is equivalent to the words in a document.
This means that each
time slice contains a mixture of routines over a period of time.
The routines to be
discovered from the activity data are the equivalent of the topics in documents.
The

tion.
total dataset is equivalent of a corpus of documents.
The representation of the LDA
model, in the context of activity data for discovering routines is given in figure 4.1.
A window length of
30 minutes,
shifted by 2.5 minutes at a time,
was used as
Huynh et al. [32] found that the performance of the topic models decreased when using
windows of a smaller size.
The number of routines was set to 10 and the Dirichlet prior
α
was 0.01.
These settings were also used for this work to allow direct comparison.
The default settings for the maximum number of iterations and convergence criteria
were used as these were not specified by Huynh et al.
Furthermore,
it was chosen
to set
α
to be estimated as part of
the model
so that the best fit to the data was
found and a random initialisation was used for the routine distributions.
There were
37 activities in the vocabulary and each was assigned a unique numerical label.
The LDA C code uses the assumption that the words of each document are ex-
changeable to be able to represent each document as a sparse vector of word counts.
Data is read from a file, where each line represents a document and is of the form:
[N] [word1label]:[count1] [word2label]:[count2] ...
[wordNlabel]:[countN]
where N is the number of unique words in the document, word
n
label is the numerical
label representing the
nth
unique word and count
n
is the number of times that word
appears in the document.
A data file of the correct format was generated at the same
time as splitting the dataset into time slices by applying a histogram function to the
labels in each time slice and printing the relevant information to the file.
This was
done for 6 days in the dataset and used to estimate the model.
A file of the same format was generated for the remaining day in the dataset so
that inference could be performed on this data to predict the routines for that day.
64
4.1.
UbiComp 08 dataset
The ground truth labels provided in the dataset for this day were also collected in
sliding windows, the same way that the documents were generated.
The mode of the
labels was used to represent the routine for each period of time.
4.1.2
Routines detected in UbiComp 08 dataset
The results of
the estimated model
for 6 days of
data are output to a file where
each line represents a routine.
It lists the log probability of
the activity given the
routine,
for each activity in the vocabulary.
This file was analysed to find the top
activities, with a probability greater than 0.02 [32], in each routine.
These were listed
in descending order of probability, as shown at the bottom of figure 4.2.
These routines were analysed qualitatively and subjectively assigned a mapping
between the routine number and the most appropriate choice from the list of ground
truth labels,
based on the most common activities that occur in the routine.
The
ground truth labels in the UbiComp 08 dataset are:
‘Lunch’, ‘Dinner’, ‘Office work’,
‘Commuting’
and ‘Unlabelled’
to cover everything else.
For example,
routine 1 has
‘sitting desk activities’ with a probability of 1.00 (to the nearest 2 decimal places) and
hence is obviously equivalent to the ‘office work’ routine.
However, routine 7 is more
ambiguous as it includes ‘driving car’ with a probability of 0.43, which is likely to be
part of the ‘commuting’ routine and ‘discussing at whiteboard’ with a probability of
0.35,
which is likely to be part of the ‘office work’ routine.
However,
it was decided
to map this routine to the ‘commuting’ routine ground truth label as the associated
activity had a higher probability.
The mappings chosen for each routine are given in
table 4.1.

4.1.
UbiComp 08 dataset
Inference was performed on the data for the remaining day,
generating the free
variational Dirichlet parameters,
γ
, as defined in section 2.2.2.
Subtracting the prior
Dirichlet
parameters,
α
from these posterior
Dirichlet
parameters
approximately
yields the expected number of
activities allocated to each routine for a particular
time slice.
This was used to determine the probability of
each routine for a time
slice and hence the routine with the highest probability was considered the predicted
routine for that time slice.
Using the mappings, a graph of the ground truth label and predicted routine for
each time slice in the remaining day was plotted, as shown at the top of figure 4.2.
It
can be seen from this that the predicted routines have a good match to the ground
truth.
There are some small differences, for example it was predicted that the lunch
routine was slightly shorter than it was recorded to be.
Additionally, a short period of
the ‘unlabelled’ routine was predicted both before and after the commuting routine,
which was not labelled in the ground truth.
However,
ground truth labelling itself
is very subjective and although the subject may not have deemed it necessary to
label these periods of time as separate routines it does not necessarily mean that it
is invalid to do so.
In addition to comparing the predicted routine with the ground truth the results
were also visualised by plotting the probability of all routines for each time slice, as
shown in the second graph in figure 4.2.
This helps to identify why discrepancies
occur between the predicted routines and the ground truth.
The graph shows that
during the main part of the day when the subject was doing office work there is one
routine which is very dominant,
with a probability of
nearly 1 for the majority of
the time.
However,
around the period that relates to the end of
the working day,
commuting and dinner it can be seen that many routines are activated,
all
with
similar probabilities.
This demonstrates that there is a lot more uncertainty as to
the prediction of what is happening during this time.
However, these results can still
be interesting as the uncertainty is quantified by the probabilities.
The original
results published by Huynh et al.
[32]
are included in figure 4.3 for
comparison.
It can be seen that although the routines found by each model
are
not exactly the same there are some strong similarities.
For example,
both models
have a routine containing the activity ‘sitting desk activities’
with probability 1.
Furthermore, both models have routine(s) that can be mapped to each of the ground
truth labels,
although Huynh et al.
do not explicitly perform this mapping or plot
the predicted routines.
Moreover,
in the original
model
the routine of ‘office work’
is shared between several
predicted routines,
whereas in the replicated results it is
dominated by just one predicted routine,
with more predicted routines relating to
the ‘unlabelled’ routine.

A leave-one-day-out cross validation was conducted using the same settings as
previously.
For each day a topic model
was estimated using the other six days of
data and then inference was performed for the left out day.
The discovered routines
were mapped to the ground truth labels using the same process as before.
Using
these mappings the most likely predicted routine for each time slice was calculated.
These mapped predicted routines were directly compared to the mode of the ground
truth labels for each time slice.
The accuracy was calculated as the number of time
slices with matching labels divided by the total
number of time slices.
The results,
given in table 4.2,
show that there is a good match between the mapped predicted
routines and the ground truth labels across all days.
Overall, this section has confirmed the results of Huynh et al.
and demonstrated
that LDA can successfully detect patterns of activities that reflect a person’s routines.
It has been demonstrated that even when the same dataset is used the random
initialisation of
the topic distributions can lead to different results with regards to
the exact proportions of the activities in the detected routines.
However, the results
still show strong correlation with the ground truth labels and can be used to explore
the high level
structure of
daily activities.
The ability of
topic models to quantify
uncertainty is a key property as it indicates a level of confidence in the results at any
time and reflects the ambiguous nature of human behaviour, such as concurrent and
overlapping activities.
At the time at which the work for this thesis was conducted, as far as the author
was aware, the work of Huynh et al.
was the only published work applying LDA to
a publicly available dataset of real world activities with ground truth routine labels
to discover routines.
A method may provide good results for a particular dataset but
this does not guarantee that it will
perform as well
on different datasets.
Applying
LDA to another dataset with similar properties helps to validate the method and
demonstrate that it can be generalised beyond a specific dataset.
The next section
considers the collection of a novel
dataset of daily activities and associated routine
labels which can be used to validate the use of
LDA to discover activity patterns
reflective of daily routines.

Collection of a novel daily activity dataset
This section highlights the properties of an ideal dataset for daily routine detection
from activity data collected in a residential
environment.
The details of
a mobile
phone application developed for collecting activity labels and ground truth routines
are presented.
The application of LDA to this new dataset is described and the results
are analysed and discussed.
The challenges involved in data collection are discussed
and improvements made to the logging application are given.
4.2.1
Dataset requirements for research into behaviour
patterns for healthcare monitoring
There are few published results of applying topic models to daily activity data.
At
the time this work was conducted the only known published results were using the
UbiComp 08 dataset from Huynh et al. [32].
Further work has since been conducted
by Seiter et al.
[125]
to compare results with other datasets,
one of which,
the Op-
portunity dataset [113], also has daily activities.
However, the Opportunity dataset,
although very detailed,
was collected in a simulated environment within a labora-
tory,
over a short time period for each participant,
approximately 20 minutes per
run through the script.
Therefore it is not as applicable for the task of daily routine
detection of
activity data in a residential
environment.
The UbiComp 08 dataset
was provided with a vocabulary of 37 activities, with one being ‘unlabelled’ and two
activities that did not occur during the seven days.
This size of vocabulary was suf-
ficient to provide interesting results that demonstrate the potential
of topic models
for identifying routines within a user’s daily activities.
Seiter et al.
explored the robustness of
topic models by developing simulated
datasets based on the UbiComp 08 dataset.
They found that the key dataset proper-
ties for providing stable topic model performance were the duration of routines, the
amount of data and the specificity of routines [124].
In particular,
it was reported
that routine duration must considerably exceed, by a factor of more than 2, the doc-
ument length, which was set to 30 minutes and is also influenced by the total amount
of data available.
Less than 5 days of data will have a large effect on the stability of
the topic model and it is recommended that at least 14 days of data is used for good
performance,
particularly for infrequent routines.
Furthermore,
routines need to be
specific and hence the activities that make up a routine should not overlap with other
routines by more than 5% [124].
70

Collection of a novel daily activity dataset
Based on this and the aims of the SPHERE project,
a reasonable dataset would
have the following properties:
•
Participant(s) from target cohort
•
Data collected for 14 + consecutive days for 24 hrs/day
•
Data based on body worn sensors, environmental sensors and RGBd cameras
•
Specific, labelled routines with less than 5% overlap
•
Collected in a residential environment
4.2.2
Development of mobile phone application for logging
activities
Unfortunately,
it is infeasible to collect a dataset with the properties listed from
raw sensors within the time-scale of
this thesis as the deployment of
the SPHERE
platform is due to occur in years 4 and 5 of
the project.
It was decided to collect
a dataset that provided a ‘gold standard’
representation of the first stage.
In other
words,
for the user to directly label
the activities they are performing as if
they
had been automatically generated by a classifier, such as Na¨ıve Bayes, from the raw
sensor data.
Huynh et al.
[32]
demonstrated that raw sensor data can be classified
into activities using mean and variance features from the accelerometer data and a
time stamp.
However, a classifier does not have 100% accuracy in activity recognition
and therefore a dataset generated directly from user annotation and assumes ‘perfect
labels’ has the limitation that it does not represent the noise that occurs in a dataset
generated by a classifier.
A mobile phone application was developed in order to log daily activity data and
the associated ground truth routine labels.
This was developed for the Windows
Phone 7.8 platform as this hardware was already available for use.
The aim of the
application was to make it easy to record the time a new activity was started and
which routine this activity was associated with.
It was decided to pre-set the labels
for the different routine categories so that they were consistent and suitable for use
as ground truth labels.
These were based on the work by Huynh et al.
[32]
and
extended to provide more detail for non-work related routines and to include a multi-
routine option for activities,
such as ‘using the toilet’
that occur as part of several
different routines.
The final list of categories is:
wake up, travel, work, lunch, dinner,
relaxation, exercise, multi and other.
The app was designed to give the user flexibility over the labels used for activities
so that it could be customised for each user’s needs.
The user could select the ‘add
new activity’
option from the menu at the bottom of
the app,
as shown in figure
71
4.2.
Collection of a novel daily activity dataset
Figure 4.4:
ADL Logger App (a) Menu options (b) Add new activity screen
4.4(a),
which brings up the screen shown in figure 4.4(b).
The user can then select
the routine category that the new activity fits into from a drop down list of
the
pre-set options and then type any description they want for the activity itself.
The
new activity is then saved as part of that user’s vocabulary and will be available for
selection on the main screen in the future.
The aim was to make the app quick to use,
so as not to be too intrusive in the
user’s daily life.
To this end, to log an activity the user simply has to open the app,
select the relevant activity from the drop down list for the corresponding routine and

press the ‘+’ button next to it, see figure 4.5(a).
If the activity to be logged is already
selected then the user only needs to press the ‘+’ button, making the process quicker.
If
there are only a few options in a routine then the drop down list will
appear in
situ, see figure 4.5(b) and if the list is longer it will open on a separate screen so it is
easier to see all of the items and find the correct one as efficiently as possible.

App.
Each activity in the vocabulary has an ID and a description and is associated
with a routine (1-9).
The log has columns for the routine ID (R),
activity ID (A),
date stamp and time at which the activity started.

Collection of a novel daily activity dataset
When an activity is logged,
both the activity and routine ids are recorded along
with the current date and time stamp.
It is assumed that each activity starts when
it is logged and ends when the next activity starts.
This avoids the need for the user
to log an end time or duration for each activity.
Figure 4.6 shows an example of a log
downloaded from the app.
When the user selects ‘download log’
from the menu an
email is automatically generated to be sent to the researcher.
The email includes the
current vocabulary and assigned unique IDs and each of the log entries since the log
was last deleted.
Each log entry is the routine ID (column R),
activity ID (column
A) and date-time stamp of when the start of the activity was logged.
4.2.3
Data collection and preprocessing
Using the custom built ADL Logger app, data was collected over sixteen non consec-
utive days for two healthy female volunteers (average age 27 years).
The participants
collected data on days when it was not too intrusive to affect their day to day lives
between 16th July and 21st August 2014.
Each participant created their own vocab-
ulary during the collection process, which are listed in figure 4.6 and appendix A.1 for
participant one and two respectively.
It was found that it was easiest to start by en-
tering a few common activities to the list and then add extra items to the vocabulary
as necessary.
The participants were also able to choose which of the pre-set categories
they felt the activity best belonged to.
Participant one had a final vocabulary of 40
activities and participant two had 37 activities, with 25 activities in common assigned
to the same routine.
Both participants also had ‘sitting talking and ‘waiting’, but for
participant one these were assigned to the ‘relaxation’
and ‘travel’
routines respec-
tively,
whereas participant two assigned both activities to ‘multi’.
Table 4.3 shows
the number of activities each participant assigned to each routine.
Comparing these
vocabularies highlights the subjective and varied nature of participant defined labels.
Although it was not possible to edit the log on the app directly,
if a participant
made a mistake or realised they had forgotten to record an activity they made a
separate note of the correct data and added this into the log once it had been down-
loaded.
The logger only records the time of
the start of
a new activity and it is

Detecting routines in the novel activity dataset
assumed that one activity continues until
the next one starts.
The number of
sec-
onds since the previous activity was calculated and vectors of the appropriate activity
and routine labels were created at a 1Hz sample rate.
This data was separated into
time slices,
equivalent of documents,
using the same method and window length as
for the UbiComp 08 dataset.
Initially, all of the days were processed together, however as each day is date and
time stamped and the data was not collected on consecutive days this meant that the
last activity of one day would be assumed to continue until
the next time data was
logged.
This lead to these activities dominating the dataset as they would have a
very large number of samples, particularly if there were a few days between the logs.
To solve this problem it was necessary to process each day individually.
However,
this does mean that the last activity of the day, usually sleep has no data associated
with it.
This is similar to the UbiComp 08 dataset,
where data was only collected
during waking hours.
4.3
Detecting routines in the novel activity
dataset
Topic models were estimated for the first 15 days of
activity data for each partici-
pant.
Trial
and error of the number of routines and model
parameters was used to
establish the most semantically coherent model for each participant when evaluated
qualitatively.
Qualitative evaluation was performed by visualising the most probable
activities in each discovered routine and judging the extent to which the combination
of
activities reflects a real
routine.
A leave-one-day-out cross validation was con-
ducted using the selected number of routines and model
parameters.
For each day
a topic model was estimated using the other fifteen days of data and then inference
was performed for the left out day.
The participants’ grouping of their activities into
routines when using the app were compared with the content of the routines found
by the topic model to establish a mapping between them.
The accuracy of the most
likely predicted routine when compared to the mode of the ground truth labels for
each 30 min time slice was calculated.
A quantitative assessment of the optimal number of routines was also conducted
using a leave-one-day-out cross validation for different numbers of routines, from 5 to
50 at intervals of five.
The perplexity (equation 2.15) of the left out day was calculated
for every model
and the average perplexity across all
days was given for the range
of routine numbers.
The number of routines with the lowest perplexity is considered
optimal [59], as a lower perplexity suggests a better generalisation performance.
75
4.3.
Detecting routines in the novel activity dataset
The dataset collected contains several sources of bias, which should be taken into
account when considering the routines detected.
Firstly,
the data was collected on
non-consecutive days and the recording days were chosen arbitrarily by each par-
ticipant in order to minimise the invasiveness of
logging data.
This results in an
imbalance in the representation of weekday and weekend days in the dataset, which
often include different routines.
It also means that routines on days that partici-
pants considered it inconvenient to log data are not represented,
which introduces
an inherent bias as participants have specifically chosen not to include certain types
of
days.
A bias was also introduced by removing long sleep activities due to not
necessarily recording the waking time on the following day.
Moreover,
both partici-
pants were young, healthy females in full-time employment and thus only represent a
small subset of the variability in routines and behaviour patterns across the full UK
population.
Finally, the participants had flexibility in the choice of activities logged
and when ‘unlabelled’ was selected, which also adds an inherent bias in the activities
represented.
4.3.1
Analysis and discussion of the detected routines
4.3.1.1
Routines discovered from models estimated for the first fifteen
days
Using the first fifteen days of data, it was found that 12 routines gave semantically co-
herent results, which had good agreement with the ground truth labels for participant
one.
For participant two,
15 routines gave the most semantically coherent results.
The participant’s grouping of their activities into routines when using the app to log
their data were compared with the content of the routines found by the topic model
to establish a mapping between them,
as shown in table 4.4.
For participant two,
even with 15 discovered routines, the activities that were logged under the ‘exercise’
routine are still
mixed up with other activities and so no routine is discovered that
maps to this ground truth label.
This suggests that the labels forced by the app do
not match the actual routine of the participant.
The routines found by the chosen topic models are shown at the bottom of figures
4.7 and 4.8 for participant one and two respectively.
They are visualised as a list of the
most probable activities for each of the routines, with the corresponding probability of
the activity given in brackets.
Inference was performed on the data for the sixteenth
day using the topic models estimated for each participant from the first 15 days.
The
results of these were processed and visualised in the same way as for the UbiComp
08 dataset.

The top plot in figure 4.7 shows the actual
logged routine and predicted routine
for each document during the sixteenth day for participant one.
It can be seen
that overall
there is a very good match between the ground truth recorded by the
participant and the output of the topic model.
However, there are some differences,
in particular,
the predicted routines have missed two bus journeys that occurred in
the morning and afternoon that day, which were logged as part of the travel routine
by the participant.
This incorrect prediction is because there were no bus journeys
in the previous 15 days of data that were used to create the model.
Using a topic
model with an infinite vocabulary may help to mitigate problems such as this where
previously unseen activities occur [211].
Furthermore,
it should be noted that the dinner routine has not been activated
for either the predicted routines or the actual
routines.
Looking at the underlying
activity data reveals that this was because on this day the only activity relating to
dinner that was logged was ‘eating dinner’, which only lasted 5 minutes.
Hence, this
was not a sufficiently long enough event for it to be recognised because time slices
are 30 minutes long and only the most common routine within that time period is
recorded.
This also happens for other activities that have a short duration,
such as
‘using the toilet’.
This is not necessarily a problem as the aim of using topic models
is to investigate high level
routines and the end users of the system could still
look
at the previous level of data fusion if they required more detailed information.
The second plot in figure 4.7 shows the probability of all
routines for each time
slice.
This provides more information about the certainty of the predicted routines.
In particular, this highlights that the ‘dinner’ routine is activated, but is not shown
on the first graph as its probability is just below that of the ‘other’
routine.
It can
also be seen that routine 9,
mapped to the ‘wake up’
routine occurs with a low
78
4.3.
Detecting routines in the novel activity dataset
Figure 4.8:

4.3.
Detecting routines in the novel activity dataset
probability at several points throughout the day.
This is not necessarily intuitive but
occurs because the model has associated the ‘using the toilet’ activity to this routine
with a relatively high probability.
It can be seen from the top graph of figure 4.8 for participant two, that there is a
good match between the actual and predicted routines for large periods of the day but
that there are also several differences for shorter periods.
The second graph confirms
that often the routines are predicted with a relatively low probability, demonstrating
uncertainty.
One difference that can be seen is that the participant logged the ‘exer-
cise’
routine first thing in the morning,
whereas the topic model
predicts the ‘wake
up’
routine.
However,
this prediction is actually valid as the underlying activity is
yoga, which is performed as part of the wake up routine but also classes as exercise.
This highlights the limitations of the subjective nature of recording the ground truth
and the limitations of the logging app.
Similarly, some of the differences during the
evening period could be considered valid.
For example,
routine 6,
which has been
mapped to ‘dinner’
includes the activities ‘phone call’
and ‘doing chores’,
which is
why it has been activated three times during the evening period.
Hence,
a more
appropriate label
for this routine may have been ‘evening routine’
but this was not
an available option in the app and could be considered too generic to be useful.
In order to investigate the differences that occur between the actual logged routines
and those predicted by the model,
a matrix of routines was generated.
Every time

slice was categorised by the mode of the logged routine labels during that period.
For
each routine label
in the app the sum of the probabilities of all
discovered routines
(mapped to the relevant labels) for the corresponding time slices was calculated and
normalised by the total
number of
time slices.
Figure 4.9 shows a visualisation of
this matrix for participant one,
where the probability of
the predicted routines for
each ground truth label is displayed using a colour scale.
The orange and reds across
the diagonal
show that,
for the routines that occurred on this day,
the probability
that the ground truth label
matched the predicted routine is high.
The ‘wake up’
routine is mistaken for the ‘travel’ routine relatively often, this is likely to be because
‘wake up’ only lasts for a short duration, occurs once in the day and is immediately
followed by ‘travel’.
Figure 4.10 represents the matrix for participant two.
This demonstrates that the
probability of predicting a different topic is relatively high,
particularly in compar-
ison with the results for participant one.
In addition,
it can be seen that although
exercise is logged it is never predicted as the topic model did not find a corresponding
routine.
Instead, the visualisation shows there is a high probability that exercise will
be predicted as ‘wake up’, because it occurs in the morning.

4.3.1.2
Leave-one-day-out cross validation analysis
The results of the leave-one-day-out cross validation, using 12 routines for participant
one and 15 routines for participant two,
were used to calculate the accuracy of the
models for each day.
For each model the routines found were subjectively mapped to
the ground truth routine labels in the same way as for the previous models.
Using
these mappings the most likely predicted routine for each time slice was calculated.
These mapped predicted routines were directly compared to the mode of the ground
truth labels for each time slice.
The accuracy was calculated as the number of time
slices with matching labels divided by the total
number of time slices.
The results
for both participants are given in table 4.5.

The results confirm that overall there is a greater level of uncertainty in the models
for participant two, with an average accuracy of 69.1%, than there is for participant
one, with an average accuracy of 79.7%.
This is probably because the ground truth
labels matched the behaviours of participant one more closely.
This highlights that
the subjective nature of the ground truth labelling can affect the results, even though
the routines found may be realistic.
For participant one,
day 1 has a much lower
accuracy than any other day.
This is because the participant only recorded the
activity of ‘gym’ on this day.
Therefore, as the model was trained on the other days
when this activity did not occur it was not possible for the correct routine to be
82
4.3.
Detecting routines in the novel activity dataset
predicted.
Moreover,
day 1 for this participant only started in the afternoon and
therefore the ‘gym’ activity accounted for quite a large percentage of the data for the
day, making the impact of this problem larger.
For participant two,
day 6 and 12 have the lowest accuracies.
This is probably
because both of these days were Sundays, whereas all of the other days in the dataset
were weekdays.
The participant’s activities and routines are very different at the
weekend and there is little training data,
therefore the model
does not perform as
well for these days.
Investigating the discrepancies in the predictions and the ground
truth confirms this.
For example, on day 6 the participant takes a long train journey,
however the corresponding activity only occurs in routine 6 with a probability of
0.06 and therefore this routine has been mapped to ‘Other’
rather than ‘Travel’
as
it contains several
activities with much higher probability that are related to the
‘Other’ routine.
4.3.1.3
Quantitative analysis for selection of number of routines
The results of the leave-one-day-out cross validation across different numbers of rou-
tines were used to calculate the average perplexity across the range for each partici-
pant.
Due to the problem of the ‘gym’ activity not occurring in any of the training
data when leaving out day 1 for participant one the perplexity for this day is of
the order of magnitude 10
9
or 10
10
.
Therefore this day has been excluded from the

average for participant one as it obscures the remaining results.
Figure 4.11 shows
how the average perplexity varies with the number of routines.
It can be seen that
overall
the perplexity is lower for participant two,
which suggests that the models
for this participant have a better generalisation performance.
This is contrary to the
accuracy results,
highlighting that qualitative and quantitative assessments do not
always correspond due to the subjective nature of the labelling process.
Labelling the
discovered routines for each participant based on their content could provide more
realistic results than using a standardised set of ground truth labels.
The average perplexity for participant one has a high rate of change for less than 15
routines.
For participant two the rate of change is steadier,
reaching approximately
zero at 20 routines.
This suggests that models with slightly higher numbers of routines
would perform better than the 12 and 15 routines,
that were subjectively chosen to
give the most semantically coherent results.
However,
although a model
with 20
routines may generalise better, it would not be as useful for further analysis of daily
routines as the size of the vocabularies for these models is only approximately double
this number of routines.
Therefore the routines would be too specific and be strongly
associated with single activities rather than groups that form a routine.
Therefore,
the semantic coherence is important when selecting the number of routines to use.
4.4
Limitations of data collection method
When using the initial version of the ADL Logger app some shortcomings were iden-
tified.
In particular, it was noticed that some activities are carried out concurrently,
for example the user may be working at their desk whilst drinking a coffee or watching
television whilst talking on the phone.
If the user has chosen to enter the activities
they can select from individually,
i.e.
‘drinking coffee’,
‘working at desk’,
‘watching
television’
and ‘talking on phone’
then they will
need to make a subjective decision
as to which the main activity currently is and log that one.
This can mean that
data that is of medical interest, such as fluid intake or social interaction, is lost.
One
solution is to list all
combinations of activities as separate items in the vocabulary.
However, this might result in a large vocabulary, making logging activities more time
consuming and requiring a larger dataset to ensure sufficient examples of each activ-
ity are included.
On the other hand, it is expected that some detail will be lost when
summarising data at a higher level and this is not necessarily a problem.
If clinicians
or users require more detailed information then the system could allow them to access
the results from lower levels of data fusion.
84
4.4.
Limitations of data collection method
Figure 4.12:
ADL Logger App (a) Menu (b) Adding a log entry
Another limitation of the app is the lack of functionality to correct mistakes, e.g.
when a user forgets to record an activity or accidentally logs an incorrect activity.
This problem was addressed by post-editing of
the log from the user’s memory of
events to provide as realistic a representation as possible.
Furthermore, when adding
activities to the vocabulary for the ADL Logger app the routine options to select
from are restrictive, even with the ‘multi’ option and do not always reflect the user’s
behaviour patterns.
For example,
participant two added the activity ‘yoga’
to the
‘exercise’ routine, however this activity actually generally occurs as part of the morn-
ing routine and hence it may be more appropriate for it to be in the ‘wake up’ routine.
This subjective selection of routines can mean the results of the topic model do not
always agree with the ground truth,
even if they are valid.
Finally,
the feedback to
indicate an activity has successfully been logged after pressing the ‘+’
button was
too subtle.

Chapter summary
The ADL Logger app was improved to address the restrictive choice of
ground
truth routines.
Instead of having a pre-defined set of routine labels, the user can use
the menu options, shown in figure 4.12(a) to separately add descriptions of different
activities and routines.
A new activity can then be logged by selecting it from the drop
down list and pressing the ‘Log activity’ button, as shown in figure 4.12(b).
Based on
the existing assumption that a routine runs over a period of several activities, when
the user logs an activity they are asked whether it is still part of the current routine
or if it is the start of a new routine, as shown in figure 4.13 (a).
If the new activity is
the start of a new routine then the user presses the change button and can select the
new routine from the list, as shown in figure 4.13 (b) and then press update routine.
Once an activity has successfully been logged a confirmation message is shown to the
user, as seen in figure 4.13 (c), to provide clear feedback.

Chapter summary
This chapter considered the application of LDA to activity data with the aim of dis-
covering daily routines.
The work of Huynh et al. [32] was replicated and the results
for the UbiComp 08 dataset were shown to be similar to those previously published.
In particular,
the topic model
with 10 routines had an average accuracy of
81.9%
when the most likely predicted routine for each time slice was compared with the
corresponding ground truth label for the results of a leave-one-day-out cross valida-
tion.
The structure of the routines discovered by the topic model
were comparable
to those found by Huynh et al.
in terms of the most probable activities.
The requirements and challenges for collecting an ideal
dataset for daily routine
detection from activity data collected in a residential
environment were discussed.
The development of
a mobile phone application to collect a new dataset of
activ-
ities and ground truth routine labels was described.
The experience of
collecting
data and the problems encountered,
such as concurrent activities were highlighted
and discussed,
with suggestions for improvements given.
LDA was applied to the
activities in the novel
dataset collected to discover patterns reflective of
daily rou-
tines.
The results presented in this chapter have shown that topic models can be
successfully used with different activity datasets to discover daily routines.
On aver-
age, across both datasets, there is a high level of accuracy, approximately 70 to 80%,
when comparing the discovered routines with ground truth labels.
Moreover, each of
the datasets included different activities,
showing that topic models will
work with
varying vocabularies.
86
4.5.
Chapter summary
For the new dataset, the results varied between the participants, in particular there
was a higher level
of uncertainty in participant two but a lower average perplexity.
This highlights that the subjective nature of both ground truth labelling and assigning
labels or mappings to the discovered routines can have a large impact on the results
and need to be considered carefully.
The semantic coherence of the routines may be
of more importance than how well they correspond to the ground truth labels.
This is
particularly true due to the unsupervised nature of topic models.
For example, when
discovering a routine that the user has not considered labelling but the content relates
to a routine the user performs the results of the topic model could be considered more
accurate than the original ground truth.
Finally,
the results have also highlighted that the amount and variation of
the
data used to estimate the model
can have a large impact on the inference results
on a held-out dataset.
For example,
having an activity occur for the first time in
a held-out dataset will
mean that the model
is unable to accurately determine the
corresponding routine,
especially if the activity lasts for a long time.
One solution
to this could be to use a topic model with an infinite vocabulary [211].
In addition,
a very different routine structure in a held-out day,
for example,
a weekend day vs
a weekday will reduce the inference performance if the model was estimated on data
without similar routine structures.
87
Chapter 5
Changes in Routines Over Time
Chapter 4 demonstrated that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be successfully
applied to activity data to discover daily routines for an individual.
The routines
found are based on the data used to estimate the model
and hence are the most
probable combinations of activities for that period of time.
However, in reality many
peoples’ routines are not fixed and will change over time, this is an example of concept
drift [212].
These changes are two-fold:
the amount of
time spent in each routine
fluctuates over time and the probability of the activities that occur within a routine
may also vary.
For example, an individual may change their job and have a shorter
commute so the amount of time spent doing this routine would decrease but the activ-
ities involved in the routine would remain the same.
Alternatively, an individual may
change their mode of commuting from driving to cycling and hence the probability
of the activities in the ‘commuting’ routine will alter.
The two commuting examples given are dramatic shifts in behaviour patterns in
order to highlight the two types of changes.
However, more subtle changes over time,
that would not necessarily be noticed by an individual or their clinician, may be an
indicator of an alteration in health status.
Being able to detect such variations could
help identify concerns and aid earlier diagnosis or monitor improvements in response
to treatment.
For example, someone with the onset of depression may start to spend
less time preparing meals as they have less motivation and energy,
hence changing
their habits from cooking home-made meals to eating ready meals.
This would mean
the probability of the activities included in their dinner routine would alter over time.
Dynamic topic models (DTMs), introduced in section 2.3.1, can be used to identify
the second type of change, that is when the probability of activities in a routine vary
over time.
This chapter investigates how DTMs can be applied to long term daily
activity datasets to detect these changes.
There are no datasets publicly available
88
5.1.
Applying dynamic topic models to long term activity data
with annotations of changes over time, therefore simulated datasets are used as this
allows the changes to be controlled.
Initial experiments were conducted to investigate
different approaches for applying DTMs to activity data, to detect changes over time
in the probabilities of activities within a routine.
A validation experiment was then
conducted to establish whether specific changes can be correctly identified without
prior knowledge of what the changes are.
5.1
Applying dynamic topic models to long term
activity data
Dynamic topic models are an extension of LDA that allow for the evolution of routines
over time.
Unlike LDA where documents are assumed to be exchangeable within the
entire corpus,
DTMs impose a sequential
structure on the data.
This means that
changes in the probability of
the activities in each routine over time are explicitly
captured using this model.
This is achieved by splitting the dataset into ordered time
slices, where a noticeable change could be expected to occur between one time slice
and the next, for example a month.
The data in each large time slice is used to create
smaller time slices,
for example 30 minutes of data,
as done in section 4.1.1 for the
LDA model.
These 30 minute slices of data are the equivalent of documents in the
original text processing context.
For each large time slice an LDA model is estimated
but the routines found are constrained to evolve from one time slice to the next,
as
shown in figure 5.1.
More specifically, the routines,
β
k
, are chained between the large
time slices using a state space model that evolves with Gaussian noise.
5.1.1
Dynamic topic model implementation
The approximate variational
inference method for dynamic topic models from Blei
and Lafferty [53],
summarised in section 2.3.1,
was implemented in C++ by Sean
Gerrish and David Blei along with the Document Influence Model [213] and released

this program is available on
Github [215] and was downloaded for use.
A python wrapper for the C++ program is
included as part of the open source library Gensim, created by Radim
ˇ
Reh˚uˇrek [216].
This python library provides functions to create and edit a corpus,
call
the DTM
program and view the resulting topics for each large time slice.
The settings and
parameters for the DTM are passed as arguments to the C++ program.
The python
library has default values for many of these settings,
which were used for standard
parameters,
such as maximum number of iterations of the EM algorithm.

Applying dynamic topic models to long term activity data

Preprocessing of the dataset to create a corpus in the same format as described
in section 4.1.1 for LDA was conducted in Matlab,
as this had been used for the
previous work,
thus allowing code reuse where appropriate.
The Gensim python
library can be used for simple visualisations of
the top activities in routines over
time.
However,
more detailed analysis of
the results was conducted in Matlab by
directly using the data files output by the C++ program as this provided greater
flexibility than interfacing through a python API.
5.1.2
Simulation of long term activity data
To date there are no open access long-term datasets for activities of
daily living
that are annotated with changes in routines over time.
Therefore,
it is not possible
to directly validate changes in the activities of
a routine discovered using dynamic
topic models on a real
world dataset because it is not known if
these variations
90
5.1.
Applying dynamic topic models to long term activity data
actually occurred.
Although simulations of activity datasets are oversimplified and
not always realistic,
they offer the benefit of
controlling specific parameters of
the
dataset.
Therefore simulations can be used to generate a long-term dataset which
has a known change occurring in it.
The changes in routines discovered by a DTM
can be compared to the known change that was included in the simulated dataset to
investigate whether it is possible to use this model to detect changes in routines over
time.
There are a variety of smart-home simulators in the literature [217–220], however
at the time of writing many of these do not have code available to use for running
simulations.
Moreover, several of these simulators are designed for different applica-
tions,
such as designing smart homes and hence are not suitable for the purpose of
creating a long-term activity dataset.
Often simulators require a high level
of user
input,
such as paths taken around the environment by the simulated humans or a
list of pre-defined events.
The output of the simulators also varies, with several im-
plementations only giving logs of simulated sensor activations.
For this experiment,
output at the activity level is desired in order that this data can be directly used as
the input for the dynamic topic model to discover routines in the activities and how
they vary over time.
Given the requirements,
the chosen simulator was the Home Sensor Simulator
created by Kormanyos and Pataki from Budapest University of Technology and Eco-
nomics [221].
The software,
written in C#,
is freely available for use and includes
two small programs that allow different layouts of houses and human behaviour pro-
files to be created.
These can be used with the main simulator to generate data as
required.
A variety of different data logs are generated for each simulation, including
activity logs at two different levels of abstraction.
The output from the simulation
also includes detailed sensor activation logs for all
simulated sensors placed in the
house layout and movement data for the simulated human.
The simulation length
and step size can be specified and the results are displayed as graphs and saved to
file.
Kormanyos and Pataki [222] created the Home Sensor Simulator to help develop
and test algorithms for ambient assisted living projects without the need to collect
real
life data with ground truth labels.
The model
assumes that there is a single
human inhabitant,
with specified behaviour characteristics,
in the simulated home
environment.
The actions and activities that occur are decided based on priorities,
which are affected by the state of
the environment and the behaviour profile.
For
example, someone will become thirsty more quickly if the temperature is high, they
are performing a physical activity and have not had a drink recently.
The simulator
assumes that exactly one activity,
at the highest level
of
abstraction,
is occurring
91
5.2.
Investigating the effect of activity data properties on detecting changes
at any given time and each of
these activities has an associated priority function.
The activity with the highest priority will
take precedence.
Priority functions are
based on the combinations of relevant constants and variables describing the current
situation, including an element of randomness that reflects the complex nature of real
life behaviours.
The hierarchical
approach to defining activities allows flexibility in the level
of
detail
for each activity.
High level
activities are made up of
a sequence of
mid-
dle level
activities.
For example,
the eat cold meal
event includes get ingredients,
eat meal
at table and put plate to sink [222].
Unlike the high level
activities,
those
in the middle level
do not have a priority function.
The middle level
activities are
further subdivided into actions, which directly influence the variables associated with
the simulation and hence affect the priorities.
For example, eat meal
at table is split
in to the actions go to table and eat meal.
Furthermore,
most actions can be inter-
rupted by others and then resumed once the interrupting action has been completed.
Interruptions are controlled by the current interrupt level, based on a combination of
the priority level
of the main activity and the interrupt levels of the corresponding
lower level activities and actions currently being performed.
The naming convention
for activities is taken directly from the simulator and are generally self explanatory.
At the low level, moving from one labelled area in the house layout to another is pre-
fixed by the word ‘go’.
A full list of activities at the low and high levels of abstraction
are given in appendices A.2 and A.3 respectively.
For all
of the experiments described in this chapter,
the Home Sensor Simulator
was used to create long term daily activity datasets using the default large home
layout.
The parameters for the human behaviour profiles are given as a percentage
and the real world meaning of the range of variability is detailed in table 5.1.
A sim-
ulation is run to generate one month’s worth of data and then the human behaviour
parameters are adjusted,
as detailed in each relevant section.
This is repeated until
data representing a full
year is simulated,
with a known gradual
change occurring.
For each dataset, a total of 12 months were simulated and all months were set to be
30 days, with a simulation step size of 10 seconds.

relevant activities should change over time within one or more routines.
Changes can
also occur at the routine level, where the probability of the whole routine occurring
changes but the activities within the routine are not affected, these types of changes
are not the focus of this work.
Two simulations were run, each changing one parameter
each month,
whilst keeping all
other variables constant.
The data generated by
these simulations were processed to create long term activity datasets with different
properties that were used as the input to dynamic topic models.
The results were
explored through visualisations and analysed to determine if the known changes could
be detected.

Experimental methods for investigating the effect of

5.2.1.1
Modelling known changes over time
For the first simulation,
the eating frequency behaviour parameter was changed by
5% each month,
whilst all
the other parameters were kept at 50% as this reflects
average behaviour in the simulator,
as detailed in table 5.1.
The hypothesis was
that activities associated with eating would increase in probability within one or
more routines.
Using the method described in section 5.1.2 a year of simulation data
was generated.
A sample of
a full
event log generated by the simulation software,
containing activities at the lowest level of abstraction, is shown in table 5.2.

The vocabulary for the dynamic topic model
was established to be all
unique
activities that occurred in the full event logs for the 12 month simulation.
The event
logs were processed to prepare the data as input to estimate a dynamic topic model.
It was assumed that the current activity continues until the next activity in the log
starts and that activities are cut off at the end of the month.
Activities were listed for
each second (1Hz) for the full 12 months.
For consistency with the method used for
LDA, in section 4.1.1, 30 minute time slices were created from this 1Hz activity data
with a sliding window of 2.5 minutes.
Each month was considered a large time slice
for the DTM, giving 17269 small 30 minute time slices per large time slice.
Dynamic
topic models were estimated using the data generated with 12 large time slices,
a
vocabulary of 76 activities and
α
= 0
.
1.
The top words and their probabilities across all
of
the months,
for each of
the
routines, were viewed using Gensim [216].
Every routine was assigned a label based
on the top activities associated with it.
The discovered routines were visualised and
explored in different ways to help identify significant patterns,
as summarised in
section 5.2.2.1, to see if they agreed with the hypothesis that eating related activities
94
5.2.
Investigating the effect of activity data properties on detecting changes
would become more likely in one or more routines.
The raw simulation results were
also analysed to ensure the induced change had been simulated as expected.
Finally,
the most likely routine for each 30 minute time slice was determined from the results
of the DTM. A histogram of the routines for each month was generated and the values
for each routine across all months were normalised to be in the range 0 to 1.
For the second simulation,
the same methods were used but instead of changing
the eating frequency behaviour parameter,
the WC use frequency parameter was
changed by 5% each month, as detailed in table 5.1.
Similarly to the first simulation,
the hypothesis was that activities associated with using the toilet would increase in
probability within one or more routines.
Generally,
using the toilet is an activity
which can occur as part of many routines at any time of the day and has a relatively
short duration.
Therefore, it was expected that these changes would be more obvious
at the activity level than those related to eating.
5.2.1.2
Impact of activity durations
The exploratory visualisations and analysis of
the results for the two simulations,
detailed in section 5.2.2, revealed that detecting changes in the probability of activities
within a routine over time is not trivial.
Changes in activities of longer durations,
such as eating, occur at the routine level rather than within a routine.
This problem
could be addressed by increasing the length of the small time slices, which is currently
30 minutes.
However, this would mean that short activities would comprise a smaller
percentage of each small time slice and hence not be well represented by the model.
To understand the length of
the different activities,
the mean,
maximum and
minimum duration of
each activity at the low level
of
abstraction in the second
simulation was calculated, as shown in figure 5.2.
This reveals that the mean duration
of all but two of the activities is less than one hour.
The ‘walk outside’ activity has a
mean duration of 01:12:31, which is only slightly greater than an hour.
In contrast,
the ‘sleep in bed’
activity has a mean duration of
07:33:24,
which is significantly
longer than any other activity.
The high mean duration for this activity causes a
large number of the small time slices used as the input to the dynamic topic model
to only contain this one activity.
Therefore the changes in other routines that are of
interest are only represented in a relatively small proportion of the small time slices.
This under-representation reduces the ability of the dynamic topic model to identify
the changes of interest within routines.
To determine the impact of
the long sleep activity on the performance of
the
dynamic topic model it was removed from the simulated dataset for the second sim-
ulation,
where the frequency of the WC use parameter was increased with time,

5.2.
Investigating the effect of activity data properties on detecting changes
this change was found to occur at the activity level.
As the mean duration of
the
majority of activities is less than an hour, any occurrences of the ‘sleep in bed’ activ-
ity that lasted longer than 1 hour were removed.
This meant that short naps would
still
be captured as these are different to sleeping overnight.
As it is assumed that
each activity in the log continues until
the next one starts the dataset was split in
to days, with the last activity ending when the first long sleep activity began.
Short
bursts of
activity,
such as getting a glass of
water,
in between long sleep activities
were discarded if they were shorter than the window length.
Another factor related to the duration of activities is the choice of vocabulary, i.e.
the level of abstraction of the activities used as input data.
Therefore the duration of
the activities at the highest level of abstraction,
listed in the shorter event log were
also investigated.
The mean,
maximum and minimum duration of
each high level
activity in the second simulation was calculated, as shown in figure 5.3.
There is only
one activity (do the dishes) with a mean duration less than 1 minute,
whereas 56%
of the low level activities are under 1 minute.
Similarly to the low level activities, the
sleep activity has a much longer mean duration, 08:04:17, than any other activity.
Using the high level activities with longer durations means each activity comprises
a larger proportion of each small time slice.
Therefore changes in the probability of
activities within a routine will be more obvious than a small change occurring for every
short activity related to watching the TV,
for example.

Investigating the effect of activity data properties on detecting changes
of
using a smaller vocabulary of
activities at a higher level
of
abstraction is that
they become more like routines.
Hence some routines can be comprised of a single
activity with probability of 1.0, providing no further insight than the original data.
To
determine the impact of using activities at a higher level of abstraction, the shorter
event logs were used to generate the 30 minute time slices as input to estimate a
dynamic topic model
with 12 large time slices,
a vocabulary of
14 activities and
α
= 0
.
1.
Finally,
combining the use of the high level
activities with the removal
of
long sleep durations was investigated.
A total of five datasets were generated from the two simulations to investigate the
effect of the activity data properties,
as summarised in table 5.3.
Only one dataset
was based on the simulation where the eating frequency parameter was changed
because it was found that this change occurred at the routine level and this is not the
focus of this work.
Four datasets were based on the simulation where the WC use
frequency parameter was changed to investigate the effect of different combinations
of properties related to the duration of activities.

The results show
that the probabilities of the top activities in most routines are static or have a very
low variation, less than 0.005.

the order of

Activities are ordered by probability and changes in order are highlighted in red text.
a discovered routine is visualised for this routine,
subjectively labelled as relaxing,
in figure 5.4 by displaying the top 6 activities for each month for the whole year.
The months with different orders of activities are highlighted in red.
Routines 4 and
10, subjectively labelled as ‘Eating and social’ and ‘Eating’ demonstrate the largest
variation in probability of the activities in the routines.
The probability of the top
activity relating to eating in each of these routines decreases in probability, although
other activities in both routines that are related to eating increase in probability.
Analysing the raw simulated data confirmed that increasing the eating frequency
parameter caused an increase of activities associated with eating.
Furthermore,
the
most likely routine for each 30 minute time slice was determined from the results
of
the DTM.
A matrix visualisation of
the variation in frequency of
each routine
over twelve months is shown in figure 5.5.
The colour corresponds to the normalised
number of
occurrences of
the routine for each month.
It can be seen that most
of the routines either have very little variation (remain the same colour) or change
frequency at random (jumping between pink and blue).
However, it can be seen that
the routine subjectively labelled as ‘Eating’ varies gradually from blue to pink from
month 1 to 12,
indicating that this routine becomes more frequent with time.
The
routine labelled ‘Getting ready’ also varies gradually, but decreases in frequency with
time.

Results of changing WC use frequency parameter
The results in this section are for dataset B where the WC use frequency parameter
was changed,
with all
activities included listed at the low level
of abstraction.
For
three DTMs estimated for K = 5,
10 and 15 routines,
the top activities in each
routine were visualised.
For the 5 routine model,
the ‘wc do’
activity occurs in the
top 6 activities for all
months of two routines and for the last 3 months of another
routine.
In all of the routines, the probability of this activity only varies by 0.002 at
most across the twelve months.
The 10 routine model
only has this activity in the
top 6 activities of
one of
the routines and its probability is slowly decreasing by a
total of 0.013 over the whole twelve months.
Finally, for the 15 routine model there
is one routine where the top four activities are related to using the toilet.
The most
likely activity is ‘wc do’
and its probability decreases gradually by a total
of
0.089
over twelve months.
The other three related activities all increase in probability over
time however.
The model with 15 routines contains one routine that is only related to using the
toilet.
Analysis of
the frequency of
occurrences of
the most likely routine for each
30 minute time slice showed that this routine is never the most likely.
Looking at
the probabilities of
the routine related to using the toilet for each time slice over
the twelve months showed that overall
there was a gradual
increase with time.
In
contrast,
the 10 routine model
does not have a routine specifically related to using

Variation over time of probability of activities related to using toilet in
two discovered routines (6 and 8) for the 10 routine DTM estimated using dataset B.
the toilet and the only routine that has a relevant activity in the top 6 does not
increase over time.
Visualising the probabilities over twelve months of
the toilet
related activities for each routine shows that for two of the routines, there is a slight
increase in the probability of some of the related activities, as shown in figure 5.6.
However,
if
it was not known that the WC use frequency parameter had been
increased it would not be obvious to look at these activities specifically.
If all of the
activities are visualised at once then the changes in the toilet related activities do not
stand out as changing significantly more than other activities by visual
inspection.
Therefore it is not possible to confidently identify changes from viewing the results
in this way.
The trends of changes in activities can be made clearer by highlighting
only those activities in routines which demonstrate a change over twelve months of
more than 25% of the minimum probability of the activity occurring in the routine,
given that the minimum is greater than 0.001.
The change in the activity over twelve
months is then scaled to the range 0 to 1 in order that the direction of change can
easily be seen, as shown for routines 6 and 8 in figure 5.7.
Making direct comparisons
between activities is not relevant as each one is individually normalised to the range
0 - 1 to allow clear observation of the trend of the change.
For the 10 routine model, the results of highlighting the activities that change the
most relative to their minimum probability shows that such changes occur in 6 out
of
the 10 routines.
Two of
these routines,
6 and 8,
have increases in toilet related
activities, figure 5.7, as was found by specifically looking at these activities.
However,
two of the other routines, 1 and 9 also show strong trends of increasing or decreasing
in activities that are related to getting a drink.
The other two routines that have
highlighted activities have more of an oscillatory pattern of change over the twelve
months, rather than showing a strong increase or decrease.

Figure 5.7:
Changes in routines 6 and 8 that vary more than 25% of their minimum
value,
which is greater than 0.001.
The range of the probability for each activity is
individually scaled (between 0 and 1),
hence comparisons across activities are not
meaningful, however it does allow a comparison of trends.
As for the 10 routine model, the 5 routine model shows the probabilities of toilet
related activities increasing within routines.
For 4 out of
5 of
the routines there
are increases in probabilities over time of relevant activities.
However, as for the 10
routine model, it would not be possible to visually identify these changes from others
if they were not being specifically looked for.
Highlighting all changing activities, that
vary by at least 25% of
their minimum probability,
reveals that increases in toilet
related activities can be found in 3 of the routines, as shown in figure 5.8.
Increases
in other activities co-occur in these routines though and one of
the routines shows
only a decrease in the ‘wc-do’ activity and changes in other non-related activities.

Figure 5.8:
Highlighted changes individually scaled to between 0 and 1, that vary the
most relative to their minimum probability, in four routines discovered by a 5 routine
DTM estimated using dataset B.
only estimated for K = 5 and 10 for each dataset as using K = 15 produces routines
that are too specific i.e.
one routine for using the toilet.
For the 5 routine model
using dataset C with long sleep activities removed,
vi-
sualising the probability of
the toilet related activities over time showed that four
routines in this model
had an increase in at least one relevant activity.
These re-
sults are very similar to those for dataset B without sleep removed.
Highlighting the
changing activities in each routine showed that increases in the probability of toilet
related activities were found in all
of
the routines except one.
Three of
these four
routines also had other highlighted changes in unrelated activities which were oscil-
lating rather than showing a steady increase or decrease in probability.
One routine
had increases in toilet related activities co-occurring with an increase in the ‘drink
water’
activity.
The final
routine only had an oscillating change in one non-related
activity.
A 10 routine model was also created for dataset C and the resulting probabilities
of
the relevant activities over time were visualised.
The results showed that toilet
104
5.2.
Investigating the effect of activity data properties on detecting changes
related activities only occurred in one of the ten routines.
Moreover, four of the top
six activities in this routine are related to using the toilet.
Determining the most
likely routine for each 30 minute time slice shows that this routine is never the most
likely.
However,
looking at the probability of
the routine over the twelve months
demonstrates that there is an increase with time.
When the vocabulary is changed to the activities at a high level of abstraction but
sleep is not removed (dataset D),
for the 5 routine model,
the WC activity occurs
in the top 6 activities of four routines.
The probability of the activity is increasing
in every routine,
but sometimes only by a small
amount.
Highlighting changes in
routines showed that the WC activity is increasing in two of the routines.
However,
the ‘someone at entrance’
activity is highlighted for four of
the routines,
although
it oscillates in probability rather than showing a steady trend.
The model
with 10
routines only has the WC activity in the top 6 activities of
one routine,
with a
relatively high probability.
This routine is very rarely the most likely for each 30
minute time slice,
but looking at the probabilities demonstrates an overall
increase
with time.
As the routines found using the K = 10 model
for datasets C and D,
with sleep
removed or activities at a high level
of abstraction were too specific,
only a K = 5
model was estimated for dataset E with both of these properties.
The results showed
that the WC activity occurs in the top 6 activities of
all
the routines.
Moreover,
the probability of this activity is increasing in four of the routines and nearly stable
in the other routine.
Highlighting changes within routines revealed that the WC
activity is increasing in three of the routines, however changes in other activities are
also highlighted.
In particular, the ‘someone at entrance’ activity occurs in all of the
routines, although it has a varying probability in four of the routines and a decreasing
probability in the other routine.
5.2.3
Discussion of detecting changes in routines
This section has investigated the use of dynamic topic models with simulated activity
datasets to determine if it is possible to find a known change over time.
In partic-
ular,
the effect of the activity data properties on detecting changes was considered.
A range of
different visualisations were explored to determine the best method for
automatically identifying relevant changes occurring at the activity level,
i.e.
the
probability of activities within a routine changing over time.
Listing the top activities and their probabilities over time for the 10 routines
found for dataset A,
where the eating parameter was changed,
showed that there
105
5.2.
Investigating the effect of activity data properties on detecting changes
was little variation for the majority of activities.
This was as expected because all
of
the simulation parameters were kept constant,
except for the eating frequency
parameter.
Viewing the results in this format provides a high level
of
detail
but
it is time consuming to consider all
of
the individual
probabilities and draw useful
information from the results.
Therefore this is not a suitable method for presenting
the data to clinicians.
Figure 5.4 demonstrated how changes in the importance of
activities within a discovered routine can be visualised in a summary diagram where
changes in the orders of activities are specifically highlighted, helping to identify the
changes quickly and easily.
These changes can be linked to behaviour changes which
help to provide users and clinicians with detailed data for aiding diagnosis.
The routines discovered did not show an obvious pattern of eating activities in-
creasing in probability within routines.
This suggests that the change did not occur
at the activity level as expected.
The matrix visualisation of the change in frequency
of each routine over the twelve months confirmed that the change was occurring at
the routine level.
It was also noted that other routines showed a decrease in fre-
quency.
The probability of all the routines sums to one for each small time slice and
therefore an increase in one routine can cause a decrease in others.
In real terms this
is equivalent to the idea that the number of hours in a day is fixed and hence if more
time is spent on eating then less time must be spent on other activities.
This impact
may be seen as a decrease in one other routine or be spread across all other routines
depending on the nature of the person and the change that is occurring.
The results for dataset B,
where the WC use frequency parameter was changed
demonstrated that the number of
routines affects the level
at which the change is
seen.
This is due to the fact that as the number of routines increases they become
more specific i.e.
only one or two activities have a high probability and the majority
of activities have a probability of approximately 0.
Therefore the routines are more
like activities and hence changes will
be seen at the routine level
rather than the
activity level.
In the case of the 15 routine DTM for dataset B, one of the routines
is only related to using the toilet and hence the change is seen at the routine level.
However, because this routine is actually still short in duration, in comparison with
the 30 minute length of the short time slices, it is never seen as the most likely routine
and therefore the change is only seen if the probabilities of the routine are plotted
over the full twelve months.
Changes at this level can be of interest to clinicians but
are not discussed further here as they are not the focus of this work.
When there are fewer routines each routine contains a larger mix of activities and
hence is less specific.
The results for the 5 and 10 routine models demonstrated that
the change in WC use frequency can be seen at the activity level.
This indicates that
the models are sensitive to the relationship between the duration of the activities that
106
5.2.
Investigating the effect of activity data properties on detecting changes
are changing and the length of the routines that they occur in,
which is affected by
the choice of the number of routines and how specific they are.
Although it is possible
to find the WC use frequency change at the activity level, the results also showed that
it is not the only change that was highlighted by considering activities that varied by
over 25% of their minimum probability of at least 0.001.
In particular, the ‘interact
with man’ activity was highlighted in several routines but had an oscillatory pattern
of change.
The simulator used includes an element of randomness in determining the
priority of each activity at any given time.
This oscillatory change pattern could be
attributed to this random change in the simulation, which is reflective of the complex
nature of real life.
Other activities are also highlighted and show a trend of increasing or decreasing
over the twelve months, such as ‘change clothes’.
These activities are not related to
the parameter that was changed but can still be valid changes caused by the random
element in the simulation or as an indirect result of the known change.
Generally,
these activities are isolated i.e.
one activity is highlighted as changing but other
associated activities are not highlighted, whereas the activities related to the known
change appear in groups that change at the same rate.
These additional
changes
reduce the confidence in the identification of
the known change.
Future work in
collaboration with clinical experts, using real datasets need to evaluate the properties
of the data and model
that will
produce clinically relevant information to help aid
diagnosis.
Changing the properties of the dataset by removing long sleep activities and/or
using a vocabulary of activities at a high level of abstraction affected the relationship
between the number of
routines chosen for the model
and the level
at which the
change was seen.
For datasets C,
D and E the routines discovered by a 10 routine
model were too specific and hence the change was seen at the routine level.
Removing
the long sleep activities means that there are fewer small time slices used as input to
the model.
Hence, each of the remaining small time slices will be a larger percentage
of the whole dataset and so the model
can find a better fit to this data as it is not
dominated by time slices with only sleep.
The resulting routines are more specific
for the same parameter K, number of routines.
Using the smaller vocabulary of high
level
activities means there are fewer activities listed in each time slice,
hence the
routines discovered have a smaller mix of activities and are more specific.
For the 5 routine models the change in the WC use frequency parameter could be
seen at the activity level
for these datasets (C,
D and E).
Other changes unrelated
to the known change were also highlighted,
similar to the results for dataset B.
For example, the oscillatory pattern of the ‘someone at entrance’ activity when using
activities at the high level of abstraction is equivalent to the behaviour of the ‘interact

Overall
the known change of increasing the WC use frequency,
was found at the
activity level for datasets B to E using models with K = 5 routines and for dataset
B using a model
with K = 10 routines.
For each of
these models,
table 5.5 sum-
marises all
of
the highlighted changes found and whether they were related to the
known change.
The percentage of routines where all of the highlighted changes were
unrelated to the simulation parameter that was varied are given.
The percentage
of routines where at least one of the highlighted changes was related to the known
change is also presented.
The details of the trend for related changes and whether
they occurred with unrelated changes are listed to indicate how clearly they can be
seen.
When there is a larger percentage of routines with a related change and all of
the related changes demonstrate the same clear trend this increases the confidence in
the change found.
The models estimated with 5 routines for datasets C and E, where
long sleep activities were removed and the activities were at a low and high level of
abstraction respectively, demonstrate the clearest visualisation of the known change
at the activity level.
5.3
Detecting unknown changes in routines
The initial
experiments suggested that changes occurring at the activity level
can
be identified more easily when estimating a model
with 5 routines,
using a dataset
where long sleep activities have been removed.
For these experiments the simulation
parameter changed over time was known,
introducing a bias when exploring the
results.
In a real
world dataset the changes occurring will
not be known a priori.
This section describes an experiment where simulations were run without the author
knowing the parameters that were changed,
in order to remove this bias.
Dynamic

Detecting unknown changes in routines
topic models were estimated for each dataset and the results were visualised to detect
any changes,
which were then compared with the revealed variation in simulation
parameters.
5.3.1
Generating datasets with unknown changes over time
An unbiased third party ran three simulations (X,
Y and Z) using the procedure
described in section 5.1.2.
For the human behaviour profiles a total of 6 options were
provided, where all of the parameters were to be set to 50% except for one or two of
the parameters.
For each option the parameters to be increased from 25% to 80% by
5% each month are given in table 5.6.
The instructions stated that two of options 1-4
and one of options 5 or 6 should be chosen; one of these for each simulation, in any
order.
The event logs generated for each simulation were given to the author without
revealing the parameters selected.

straction and one at the high level.
A 5 routine dynamic topic model was estimated
for each of the six datasets and the vocabulary for each model consisted of all possi-

a sliding window of 2.5 minutes and each month was considered a large time slice.
5.3.2
Changes in routines found using dynamic topic
models
The results from models estimated for datasets F and G suggest that the exercise
frequency simulation parameter was increased in simulation X,
indicating option 4
was selected.
The reasons for concluding this are discussed here.
Visualising the
probabilities over time of the top 6 activities in each routine, discovered by the model
estimated using dataset F, shows an increase in the ‘do exercise’
activity in routine
1, as shown in figure 5.9a.
A log scale is used in order to visualise all of the activities
at once.
There are also changes in activities relating to eating and using the toilet in
two of the routines, therefore this alone is not enough evidence to draw a conclusion.
Viewing the highlighted changes, shows that every routine has the ‘interact with
man’
activity,
however it has an oscillatory pattern of
change rather than showing

Detecting unknown changes in routines
a strong increase or decrease.
Therefore it is unlikely to be related to the changing
simulation parameter but can still be a valid change occurring in the data due to the
random element in the simulation.
Routine 1 shows increases in highlighted changes
for exercise related activities and decreases for eating related activities, as shown in
figure 5.9c.
Whereas,
routine 2,
figure 5.9d shows increases in many activities that
are related to eating.
This is also inconclusive as the trend of the highlighted change
for eating related activities is opposite in the two routines.
As it is possible for changes to also occur at the routine level
the most probable
routine for each 30 minute time slice was determined.
The variation in frequency for
each routine across the full simulation duration is visualised as a matrix, as shown in
figure 5.10.
The colour corresponds to the normalised number of occurrences of the
routine for each month,
where blue is the lowest and pink is the highest frequency.
It can be seen that routine 1 is occurring more often and routine 2 is decreasing in
frequency.

Results from a 5 routine DTM

Combining this information shows that exercise related activities are becoming
more likely within routine 1, in addition to the routine increasing in frequency overall.
In contrast, although eating related activities are increasing in probability in routine
2,
overall
the routine is occurring less frequently.
Furthermore,
the eating related
activities in routine 1 are decreasing, although the routine is becoming more frequent.
Hence the changes at activity and routine level
effectively cancel
each other out for
the eating related activities,
whereas for the exercise related activities they have a
compound effect.
This strongly suggests that the simulation parameter changed over

Detecting unknown changes in routines
time is the exercise frequency.
The same patterns can be found in the results from
the dynamic topic model estimated for dataset G.
For datasets H and I, the results from the dynamic topic models suggest that both
the drink frequency and WC use frequency simulation parameters were increased,
indicating option 5 was selected.
The evidence leading to this conclusion is presented
here.
Visualising the top 6 activity probabilities over time for the model
estimated
using dataset H shows that there are changes in activities related to drinking and
using the toilet in three of
the routines.
There are also changes in other activities
across the routines but none of these are as consistent, for example the ‘go tv’ activity
decreases in routine 2 but activities related to watching tv do not occur in the other
4 routines.
This evidence alone is inconclusive.
Finding the highlighted changes for each routine gives further insight into the
results.
This shows that WC use related activities are increasing in 80% of
the
routines and drink related activities are increasing in 60% of the routines.
The other
highlighted changes that occur are much more variable and the probabilities tend to
oscillate over time.
Moreover, for this dataset, it was found that there was very little
variation at the routine level, indicating the change is occurring at the activity level
as desired.
The results of the model estimated using dataset I show that when visualising the
top 6 activities in each routine over time the WC activity is changing in 100% of the
discovered routines and the drink activity is changing in 60%.
There are also changes
in other activities across all
of
the routines but they generally show an oscillatory
pattern of change.
A similar picture can be seen in the highlighted changes, as shown
in figure 5.11.
For three of
the routines the highlighted changes show increases in
WC,
drink or both.
However,
the WC activity is decreasing in two routines.
The
other highlighted changes all
demonstrate an oscillatory pattern of change.
Overall
the only consistent changes with a strong trend are for activities related to drinking
and using the toilet,
suggesting these are the simulation parameters changed over
time.
The results of the dynamic topic models estimated using datasets J and K suggest
that the eating frequency simulation parameter was increased,
indicating option 2
was selected.
Considering the probabilities of
the top 6 activities in each routine,
found by the model
estimated using dataset J,
suggests there is no obvious change
at the activity level.
Routines 1 and 4 show a decrease in activities related to using
the toilet and routine 2 shows a decrease in the ‘drink water’
activity.
Routine 5
shows the most changes, with eating related activities both increasing and decreasing
and the ‘wc do’
and ‘drink water’
activities increasing.

In particular,
routine 5 has many
highlighted changes,
as shown in figure 5.12,
including several
activities related to

The matrix representation of the variation over time of the frequency of each rou-
tine, figure 5.13, demonstrates that routine 5 is occurring more often over the twelve
months.
This shows that the change is happening at the routine level.
Therefore,
although the eat warm meal
activity is decreasing within routine 5,
the increase in
several other eating activities and the overall increase in the routine provides strong
evidence that the change is in the eating parameter.

mated using dataset K also do not demonstrate any obvious consistent change at the
activity level.
There is an increase over time at the routine level of routine 1, which
has the top activity ‘eat cold’.
In addition,
the highlighted changes for this routine
show the ‘do the dishes’ activity increasing.
After the results were analysed and the predicted options determined the original
selections were revealed,
as summarised in table 5.8.
It can be seen that the cor-
rect option was successfully identified using the routines discovered by the dynamic
topic models for every simulation.
This demonstrates that it is possible for unknown
changes over time to be identified using DTMs on a simulated dataset.
However,
some of
the changes found were at the routine level
rather than the activity level.
Furthermore, additional changes were identified as well as those related to simulation
parameters changed.
The limited list of
possible changes to be found means that
there is still an element of bias and further work is required to validate this approach
using long term annotated real world datasets.

Chapter summary
This chapter has considered the use of
dynamic topic models to identify changes
in the probabilities of activities within discovered routines.
The initial
experiments
demonstrated that these types of changes can successfully be identified for a simulated
dataset with a known change.
However, some of the changes occurred at the routine
level, that is the probabilities of the activities within a routine remained similar over
time but the routine occurred more frequently over time.
It was found that the
relationship between the duration of the activities in the dataset used as input and
the number of
routines specified affect how easily a change can be identified.
The
best performing combinations for the simulated datasets investigated were identified
as models with 5 routines and removal
of
long sleep activities from the data.
The
vocabulary used did not have much effect on the performance.
These selections of
activity data properties and model
parameters were used to
estimate DTMs and identify unknown changes in six datasets created from three
115

Chapter summary
different simulations.
The results showed that the DTMs can successfully be used
to identify changes when they are not previously known.
This indicates that DTMs
have potential for identifying changes in routines over time occurring in real activity
data.
There are limitations with these results as they are for simulated data with a
maximum of two parameters changed over time and a limited number of options to
choose from when identifying the unknown changes.
Different visualisations and techniques to explore the routines discovered by DTMs
have been explored.
The results demonstrated that considering how the probabilities
of
the top activities in each routine vary over time can reveal
interesting patterns.
However,
interacting with the results at this level is time consuming and would not
be suitable for end users unless summary diagrams that clearly outline the changes
can be automatically generated.
Presenting all
of
this information,
including the
magnitude or significance of
a change,
concisely and clearly is a challenging data
visualisation task.
A new visualisation technique was proposed that highlights changes in activities
that meet given criteria.
For the simulated datasets the requirements were that the
activity must vary by over 25% of its minimum probability and that the minimum
probability must be at least 0.001.
This approach uses the relative change of
the
probability rather than the absolute change.
The probability of
an activity in a
routine is the likelihood of that activity if the routine is occurring and hence activities
of
shorter duration will
have lower probabilities.
This does not mean that a small
change in absolute terms is not significant if it has a large change relative to its initial
probability.
The highlighted changes are scaled from 0 to 1 in order to visualise the
trend of
the change clearly.
A change that oscillates over time is less likely to be
significant if it is related to natural phenomenon, such as seasonal changes or random
fluctuations.
These criteria were shown to be successful
in highlighting the large
relative changes in the simulated datasets considered.
However, they may not relate
to significant real world healthcare criteria for a real dataset.
Future work needs to address the limitations of the existing results.
Firstly, a larger
experiment on more complex simulated datasets with multiple parameters changing
and no limited list of permutations is required.
This would demonstrate the ability
of
DTMs to detect changes in data that are more similar to a real-world dataset.
A large number of varying parameters may cause the results to highlight too many
changes to be helpful
in understanding the data.
In addition,
the activity labels
generated by the simulator are assumed to be a perfect representation of the person’s
behaviour.
In reality, activity recognition algorithms using raw sensor data will not be
completely accurate and hence noise will be introduced into the system.
The impact
of this can be investigated using simulated datasets by manually varying deletion and
116
5.4.
Chapter summary
insertion errors of the generated activities,
as done for LDA and other topic model
variants by Seiter et al. [125].
Secondly,
a real-world long term dataset with known
changes would be needed to demonstrate that the method can work on data that is
not simulated.
Furthermore,
valid criteria for detecting significant changes related
to health and well-being will
need to be established in collaboration with relevant
experts.
The combination of activity data properties and model parameters for this exper-
iment were chosen in relation to the data generated by the simulator.
Only some of
the changes made were discovered at the activity level.
This is due to the variation in
duration of activities.
A new vocabulary where activities are selected to ensure that
their mean duration is within a specified range would improve the performance of the
DTM. The length of the small time slices would also be set in relation to the length
of activities so that most of the time slices contain a mixture of different activities.
These decisions should be made in conjunction with expert clinical opinions in order
to be able to identify changes that are significant in terms of healthcare.
Different
models may be required for different situations if
changes are occurring at varying
levels of granularity.
Certain changes in behaviour can be detected simply by monitoring how frequently
relevant activities occur.
However, if there are a lot of activities being recorded then it
would be time consuming to review and identify changes at this level.
It is quicker for
a clinician to be given a summary at a higher level, only reviewing more detailed data
if necessary.
The benefit of using DTMs to identify changes within routines is that
this processing can be done automatically to provide the user a concise summary.
Only analysing changes at a higher level
directly would risk the loss of
important
information that is hidden in the data.
DTMs enable both a high level
summary
whilst still incorporating useful information from the more detailed data.
In conclusion,
dynamic topic models are useful
for detecting changes over time
in the probabilities of the activities that compose a routine.
DTMs should be used
carefully as certain conditions and assumptions need to be met for them to perform
well.
This approach is not a one size fits all solution as it is affected by the model and
dataset parameters and how they relate to each other.
For example,
a model
that
performs well for detecting changes in activities that only last a few minutes within a
routine that is varying on a weekly basis will not perform well if applied to a dataset
containing changes in activities that last half
an hour within a routine that varies
every few months.
This is a limitation of the approach as it is not generalisable and
needs to be tuned using expert knowledge and contextual
information for different
scenarios.

Chapter 6
Detecting Eating Event Types in
Nutrition Data
Many chronic conditions are related to diet,
such as diabetes and obesity [7, 16].
Therefore, one important focus for a healthcare residential monitoring system is the
consumption of food and drink.
Recently,
nutrition research has moved away from
the traditional
approach of investigating relationships between single nutrients and
specific health outcomes to take a more holistic view by considering dietary patterns
[184, 223].
This approach reflects the fact that links between diet and health are
multifaceted and complex.
Furthermore, it acknowledges that single nutrients are not
consumed alone;
in fact people eat items of food,
which contain multiple nutrients.
Equally, meals or snacks represent combinations of food consumed together within an
eating event.
The ingestion of nutrients and foods in combinations can interact with
each other and therefore considering how they occur together could help to reveal
stronger relationships to health outcomes than considering them individually [16,223].
Several
studies consider the association between different eating behaviours,
es-
pecially snacking,
and the impact on diet quality and health.
Results throughout
the literature are often conflicting and this is,
in part,
due to not having consistent
definitions for different eating events, including what a snack is [17, 18, 184].
As high-
lighted in section 3.3.3, there are a variety of methods used in studies to define eating
events;
moreover,
these definitions are often biased by cultural
norms [184].
Clear
definitions of
eating events are required to enable consistent research into related
health outcomes and determinants of eating behaviours [18].
They would also inform
public health guidance, to ensure that advice is relevant and useful.
This chapter will
consider how topic models can be applied to nutrition data to reveal patterns in the
combinations of food groups consumed together in different eating events.
118
6.1.
Applying topic models to nutrition data
6.1
Applying topic models to nutrition data
The aim of applying topic models to nutrition data taken from food diaries, which has
not previously been considered, is to identify combinations of food groups consumed
together in an eating event.
It is hypothesised that the results of the topic model will
be representative of eating events composed of similar combinations of foods, which
can be subjectively labelled as meals or snacks.
This could provide a standardised
approach for categorising eating events that could be used within the nutrition re-
search community.
In order to apply LDA to food diary data it is necessary to define
the probabilistic model, as presented in 2.2, in the context of this application.
This is
not a trivial problem and this section describes the approach taken to find a suitable
vocabulary and method for document creation for the National
Diet and Nutrition
Survey Rolling Programme (NDNS RP) dataset.
This dataset includes dietary data
from four-day unweighed food diaries,
with each item consumed by a participant
listed separately.
6.1.1
National Diet and Nutrition Survey (RP) dataset
The NDNS RP was a continuous cross sectional
survey conducted from 2008 to
2012 [224].
The survey investigated food consumption,
nutrient intake and nutri-
tional status of people aged 18 months or older and living in private households, from
a representative sample across the UK population.
The sample was drawn using a
multi-stage stratified random sampling procedure.
Addresses were selected randomly
from primary sampling units,
which are clusters of addresses from the postcode ad-
dress file for the UK. The aim was to collect data for 500 adults and 500 children each
year,
therefore for some addresses only children were selected to participate.
Extra
addresses for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland were selected to boost sample
sizes for these countries to enable comparisons between countries, however these were
not included in the available datasets (Core Sample Data) at the time of this work.
In total
there were 4,156 fully productive participants for whom a complete set of
data is available.
Full
details of how the survey was conducted and all
of the data
collected is available from the UK dataservice [225].
This data was accessed under
usage number 87742 on 23/02/2015.
The study includes detailed dietary data from unweighed four-day food diaries
recorded by the participants,
although participants who only completed three days
were still
classified as fully productive.
The food diaries were completed over four
consecutive days.
Across the whole study all
days of the week were represented as
equally as possible, accounting for the preferences of the participants [224].
The in-
119

Applying topic models to nutrition data
formation from these diaries were coded by trained individuals using the Department
of Health’s NDNS RP Nutrient Databank.
Each item, or component part of compos-
ite items such as a sandwich,
recorded in the diaries was assigned a food code and
portion code [226].
The aim of
coding food diary data is to establish the nutrient
composition as accurately as possible.
Recipes for composite foods can vary widely
and hence they are separated into their constituent ingredients to improve accuracy.
Variation between recording composite items in their entirety or as component parts
depends on the availability of information supplied by the participant and data on
food composition in the database.
The data from the entire survey is provided at individual and household levels and
food diary data at food, day and person levels.
For this work, the food level dietary
data is generally used,
which consists of
384,028 records,
one for each food item
recorded for each participant,
on each day.
This provides very detailed information
about each item consumed,
including the food name,
food group,
food subgroup,
recipe group,
nutrients,
weight and energy content.
In addition,
contextual
data is
included,
such as unique ID,
age,
sex,
location eaten,
company when eating,
day of
week and time of consumption.
However,
for some of the exploratory work the day
level dietary data for foods was also considered.
This consists of 16,540 records, one
for every diary day for each participant,
giving a record of the total
weight of each
food group consumed during the day.
It should be noted that the food groups used
in this section of the data vary slightly from those used in the food level data.
Full
details can be found in the NDNS RP documentation [182, 227]
and are listed for
reference in appendix B.1.
6.1.2
Choosing vocabulary
For the purpose of this work,
an eating event is defined as all
items consumed at a
specific time on one day, as recorded to the nearest second in the food diary [228].
In
other words, every entry in the food diary (a group of items consumed at a specified
time) is equivalent to an eating event.
The important information about analysing
an eating event is its energy content, weight, constituent food items and time of day.
Therefore,
it was initially proposed that the vocabulary used for the topic model
should include these aspects.
It was thought the food names given in the dataset
could be used directly as these are already mapped to food groups and subgroups so
no information would be lost.
To have a separate vocabulary entry for every weight,
energy value and time would result in a verbose vocabulary e.g.
a 40g (94 kcal) slice
of white bread eaten at 7am would be one vocabulary item.
Therefore the dataset was
analysed to decide on realistic groupings which could be used as vocabulary items,
120
6.1.
Applying topic models to nutrition data
e.g.
weights between 1 and 50g could be one vocabulary item and energies between
0 and 100 kcal could be another.
A statistical
summary of
the dataset was used to determine suitable ranges for
grouping the meal
time,
energy and weight variables.
It was found that meal
times
recorded in the dataset ranged across the full 24 hour period.
The maximum interval
between any two meal times recorded for any participant across the whole dataset was
found to be 10 minutes.
The sum of the energy of all items in each eating event was
also analysed.
The majority of eating events had a total energy content of less than
2000kcal.
Items over 2000 kcal
were for example,
1kg of pizza or 500g of chocolate.
A histogram of the total energy of eating events was created, automatically selecting
the bin width to fit the data and reveal the shape of the underlying distribution.
An
optimal bin width of 20 kcal was found,
as shown in figure 6.1, energies above 1000
kcal are not displayed here as the frequencies are relatively small.
The same approach
was taken for analysing the sum of the weight of all items in each eating event.
It was
found that the majority of eating events had a total weight of under 2kg.
Typically
beer and cider consumption contribute to entries over 2kg.
The histogram of weights
finds an optimal
bin width of
10g and the distribution of
weight up to 1kg can be
seen in figure 6.1.

121
6.1.
Applying topic models to nutrition data
Based on this analysis an initial set of vocabulary items were chosen as described
below.
For the energy, weight and time, each item was created from a prefix, repre-
senting the relevant type of data, and the associated range.
This creates descriptive
words that facilitate subjective analysis of the final results of a topic model.
In total
there were 4521 vocabulary items, each assigned a unique ID.
The initial vocabulary items were as follows:
•
Food names of all items in dataset
•
Meal
Time ranges in 10 min intervals from midnight to midnight (MT00:00-
00:10 to MT23:50-00:00)
•
Energy content ranges in 20kcal intervals from 0 to 2000 kcal (E0-20 to E1980-
2000) and energy content over 2000 kcal (E2000+)
•
Weight ranges in 10g intervals from 0 to 2000g (W0-10 to W1990-2000) and
weights over 2000g (W2000+)
Using this vocabulary with the assumption that a document in the original LDA
model is equivalent of one eating event for this application restricts every vocabulary
item to appear once at most in any document.
If there was a larger quantity of any
one item it would just be listed in the original
diary data with a higher quantity.
Only having items appear once per document would result in very sparse documents.
One solution considered was to change the vocabulary to use the 60 food groups
that exist in the dataset, rather than the individual food names, as each food group
contains many food items and hence may occur more than once in a document.
Other
solutions based on changing the document structure were also considered and these
are outlined in more detail in section 6.1.3.
Furthermore,
having separate vocabulary items for energies,
weights and times
meant that the intrinsic relationship between a particular food item and its properties
was lost.
One option considered was to combine food names or food groups together
with the weight,
energy or energy density,
for example,
‘Bacon and Ham E80-100’
could represent a 90 kcal portion of bacon.
This would create unique vocabulary items
that maintain the link between the properties and the item.
However,
this would
lead to a verbose vocabulary where words would occur infrequently in documents,
hence this approach was not considered appropriate for the modelling assumptions.
Alternative solutions are described in more detail in section 6.1.3.
The separate weight,
energy and time vocabulary items meant that some of the
topics found by the model
did not contain any food items or food groups in the
list of
most significant words.
An example of
a topic with only time and energy
values in the top 10 words is given in figure 6.2b.
Although such topics could still
reveal interesting information about patterns between weights, energies and times; for
investigating types of eating events it is desired to know about the specific food groups

In contrast,

6.1.3
Approaches to creating food documents
For the original application of LDA to a corpus, a document is implicit and does not
need to be defined.
However,
when applying the model to alternative types of data
it is necessary to consider and define what is meant by a document.
A document
is represented as a bag of
N words taken from the vocabulary but the boundaries
of
the collection are not defined for this application.
For continuous data,
a given
time slice can be used to define a document,
such as a 30 minute window,
as used
for the activity data in chapter 4.
In contrast to the activity datasets,
the NDNS
RP dataset contains data from a large number of participants, rather than long term
records for a few participants.
Furthermore,
food diaries are recorded as discrete
eating events,
at specific times,
with varying intervals in between events for each
participant.
Therefore, using windows of a specified length for eating events recorded
for one participant does not guarantee that all documents will contain data.
Initially,
a document was considered to be a single eating event,
as defined in
section 6.1.2.
Documents were created by recording all
of
the relevant vocabulary
items for the eating event, from the original vocabulary of 4521 items.
For weights,
energies and times the vocabulary item representing the range in which the actual
value occurs was used.
As mentioned in section 6.1.2,
creating documents based on
a single eating event means that they are very sparse.
Although using food groups
123
6.1.
Applying topic models to nutrition data
is an improvement over using the food item names directly the documents remain
sparse.
In order to reduce the problem with sparsity in the documents and to encode the
relationship between a food item and its properties more explicitly, a new approach
was taken to creating documents.
Each food group was repeated in proportion to
its energy content, using a vocabulary of food groups only.
Using this approach the
topic model
discovered some semantically coherent topics which are representative
of
typical
eating events.
However,
some of
the topics were combinations of
food
groups that did not relate to a typical eating event when evaluated qualitatively.
For
example, a topic with the following top vocabulary items and associated probabilities
in brackets,
‘biscuits (0.59)’,
‘eggs and egg dishes (0.24)’
and ‘white fish coated or
fried (0.16)’ would be challenging to apply a subjective eating event type label to.
Repeating the food groups solves the sparsity problem, however if a topic is con-
sidered to be a type of eating event and a document is created based on a single eating
event, then by definition, a document will only exhibit one topic.
This does not sup-
port the assumption of LDA that a document will exhibit multiple topics.
Therefore,
the structure of a document was revised so that each document is created using the
data from one full day.
As described in section 6.1.1, the dataset also includes data
at the day level, recording the total weight in grams, for each of the 67 food groups,
consumed during the day.
This data subset was used to create documents at a day
level, with a vocabulary of 67 food groups, where each food group is repeated in pro-
portion to the weight consumed on that day.
The resulting topics from this approach
were subjectively identified by a nutritionist expert to be more reflective of different
lifestyle dietary patterns, rather than types of eating events.
For example, the topic
fruit
yogurt fromage frais and dairy desserts
wholemeal bread
skimmed milk
salad and other raw vegetables
high fibre breakfast cereals
Figure 6.3:

124
6.1.
Applying topic models to nutrition data
displayed in figure 6.3 is representative of food groups that would be likely to appear
in a low-energy dense, low-fat, high-fibre diet [229].
As day level data did not produce the desired results, an alternative approach to
creating documents with more than one eating event was taken.
It was proposed
to create documents using all
eating events that occur in the dataset at a given
time,
t
, to the nearest second, regardless of the person or day on which the event was
recorded.
Creating documents using this method means that the time of eating is still
represented but documents can exhibit multiple types of eating events.
This approach
to creating documents was used together with various vocabularies,
including food
names and food groups as well
as different representations,
such as single items or
repetition proportional to energy content.

Applying topic models to nutrition data
Another approach proposed for creating documents representing multiple eating
events was to use all
eating events that occur in the dataset with a total
energy
content within a given range.
The 20kcal ranges used for the original vocabulary and
based on the analysis of the dataset are not suitable as this would only create 101
documents.
Therefore,
5kcal
ranges were selected to give 401 documents:
one for
each 5 kcal interval from 0 to 2000kcal and one for 2000kcal and over.
A vocabulary
of
food groups was used with this document structure.
The topics discovered had
very low semantic quality and had no clear link with different types of eating events.
It was noted that many of the documents contained the large majority of vocabulary
items, making it harder for the model to distinguish between different documents and
find relevant patterns.

structures and vocabularies investigated are summarised in table 6.1.

strates that the most promising combination is a vocabulary of food groups in the
NDNS RP dataset and a document structure of
all
eating events at time
t
.
This
combination matches the underlying assumptions of
LDA,
in particular,
ensuring
that documents exhibit multiple topics.
In addition,
the discovered topics are se-
mantically coherent in the context of discovering eating event types.
This document
structure creates 1038 documents,
one for each unique time recorded to the nearest
second, that appears in the dataset spanning a full 24 hour period in total.
For each
document,
the corresponding food group for every food item,
in each eating event
recorded at time
t
, is listed.
The selected document structure and vocabulary is used as the basis for the re-

The representation of

Here types of eating events
are equivalent of topics;
a collection of eating events at a given time are equivalent

6.2
Detecting types of eating events
The selected document structure and vocabulary were used to carry out experiments
to evaluate the performance of
topic models in the context of
understanding how
foods are combined together in different types of eating events.
A sensitivity analysis
of
the impact of
different properties of
the dataset was also conducted.
Different
methods for analysing the results of a topic model
to assess how well
it is perform-
ing were presented in section 2.4.
This included both qualitative and quantitative
techniques for evaluating the model in the given context.
For this application, qual-
itative evaluation of the resulting eating event types is extremely important as these
are what will
be utilised by the nutrition research community to facilitate further
research.
Even if a model statistically performs very well, if the results do not have
any tangible meaning then it is not possible to use them as a basis for future analysis.
However, quantitative analysis still plays an important role, to ensure that the results
are representative of the data.
In addition, quantitative techniques can help confirm
the selection of model parameters.
6.2.1
Experimental methods for investigating the
performance of topic models applied to nutrition data
For consistency,
the same C implementation of
variational
inference for LDA from
David Blei
[51]
was used,
as described in section 4.1.1.
Although the data source
is different,
documents are still
represented as sparse vectors of word counts in the
same format as previously used.
The preprocessing to generate the vocabulary list
and create the documents with the selected structure from the NDNS RP dataset was
done in MATLAB. Eating events were identified in the dataset by grouping the food
level data on the ‘ID’, ‘meal time’ and ‘day no.’
variables.
For the chosen document
structure, every unique time in the full dataset was identified and for each of these,
all
of
the corresponding eating events were selected.
The food groups of
all
items
consumed during these eating events were counted and used to create the sparse
127

Detecting types of eating events
word vector for the document.
The numbering system used to identify food groups
in the dataset was used as the numerical representation of the vocabulary.
1
For each model,
the number of
eating event types and the initial
value of
the
Dirichlet prior,
α
,
were set to the desired values,
as specified in section 6.2.2.
The
default settings for the maximum number of iterations and convergence criteria were
used, as done in section 4.1.1.
The value of
α
was set to be estimated as part of the
model so that the best fit to the data was found and a random initialisation was used
for the eating event types distributions.
6.2.1.1
Qualitative and quantitative analysis for full NDNS RP dataset
Post-processing of the results was also carried out in MATLAB.
The most intuitive
way to qualitatively evaluate the results is to investigate the eating event types,
which are the probability distributions over the vocabulary,
β
k
.
The top food groups,
with a probability greater than or equal to 0.02 [32], for each eating event type were
determined.
The list of food groups enables an assessment of how well
the content
of
the discovered eating event types reflect reality.
In addition,
it is useful
to be
able to visualise these results in a more compact form for a quick evaluation.
A tool
was developed in MATLAB to print out up to the top 10 food groups of an eating
event type in order of
probability where the font size of
the food group is directly
proportional to the probability that it occurs in the eating event type.
Subjective assessment based on knowledge of different types of eating events was
used to determine the semantic quality of the eating event types found and to apply
a label that summarised the content of the eating event type for further analysis.
For
example, an eating event type with top food groups such as bread, margarine, ham,
salad and similar, appears to be a combination of items that could form a sandwich
or other typical lunch time eating event.
This assessment was verified by a nutrition-
ist expert,
with experience looking at different combinations of
food groups in the
context of eating events.
These subjective labels are used to aid visualisations of the
results and as the basis of
further analysis,
as presented in chapter 7.
However,
it
should be understood that they are only a representative description of the underlying
probability distribution and are open to interpretation by experts in the nutrition re-
search community as required.
In essence the discovered eating event types represent
the most likely combinations of food groups consumed by a representative sample of
the UK population.
1
In the NDNS RP dataset the main food groups are numbered from 1 to 61,
but there is no
food group associated with 46 [182].
This is due to changes in the coding of food groups made since
previous versions of the survey.
128
6.2.
Detecting types of eating events
Further insight into the results of a topic model can be gained by considering how
the probability of
each eating event type
β
k
varies with the time of
day.
As each
collection of eating events is related to a time of day, for the purpose of visualisation,
a 24 hour period can be split into 10 minute intervals and the collections of eating
events grouped accordingly.
The most probable eating event type across all collections
of eating events for each 10 minute interval can be determined and plotted against the
time of day.
Furthermore, a more detailed graph can be generated, such as in figure
6.8, where the average probability of each eating event type across all documents in
a 10 minute interval is plotted for every interval.
A quantitative assessment using a ten-fold cross validation was conducted,
with
perplexity (equation 2.15) as a measure of
the performance of
each model
on the
held-out fold.
A fold is 10% of the data,
with 103 randomly selected collections of
eating events in each fold.
For every fold a topic model
was estimated using the
remaining 9 folds of the data for 5 to 50 eating events types at sampling intervals of
5.
The model
was then used to perform inference on the held-out fold of data and
the perplexity of the results was calculated.
The average perplexity across all
folds
was then calculated for the range of number of eating event types.
The number of
eating event types around which the perplexity was lowest was identified and a more
detailed analysis was carried out using the same method but for a range of
eating
event type numbers from 5 to 20 at sampling intervals of one.
This was to provide a
clearer picture of how the perplexity varies around this key value.
This quantitative
analysis ensures that the results are representative of the data and helps to confirm the
selection of the number of eating event types determined by the qualitative analysis.
6.2.1.2
Sensitivity analysis for NDNS RP dataset
Whilst exploring the results of the topic models for qualitative analysis it was noted
that certain vocabulary items often appear with a larger probability than others.
In
particular,
the food group of
‘tea,
coffee and water’
often dominates several
topics
in a model.
This was highlighted by a nutrition expert to possibly be an artefact of
the original dataset.
Two different potential causes were considered and investigated
further to understand their impact, if any, on the results of the model.
One possible reason for an elevation in probability of certain food groups is the
coding method used in the NDNS RP dataset e.g.
the nature of
the groupings of
food items into food groups.
Each food group contains a different number of
food
items.
For example,
the ‘vegetables not raw’
food group includes many different
vegetables, whereas the ‘eggs and egg dishes’ food group contains a smaller variety of
items, such as omelette or quiche.
Hence, if a person ate a roast dinner for example,
129
6.2.
Detecting types of eating events
the food group ‘vegetables not raw’ would occur 3 times in the relevant document if
they had broccoli,
cabbage and carrots as part of their meal.
Whereas,
if a person
ate a quiche for example,
the food group ‘eggs and egg dishes’
would only occur
once in the document.
This is not necessarily the most representative approach
for nutrition analysis.
To investigate the impact of
this on the results a modified
dataset of collections of eating events was created as before, but for every eating event
each food group was only allowed to occur a maximum of once.
Any repetitions of
food groups in a single eating event were removed, although the collection of eating
events could still have each food group listed multiple times overall as it still contains
multiple eating events.
A second potential reason is the limited selection of food groups related to drinks
appearing in topics compared with possible permutations of food groups related to
food items.
Hence, the same drinks will often occur with many different permutations
of
food.
The impact of
this potential
bias was investigated by removing all
eating
events that contain only drinks,
including sugar in teas and coffees and powdered
drinks,
such as hot chocolate.
All
dietary supplements were also removed from the
dataset,
as these are often taken as part of
an otherwise drink only event and are
not of particular interest in this analysis.
A modified dataset of collections of eating
events was created as before using this reduced set of eating events.
Finally, a third modified dataset was generated using collections of eating events
where both the food groups could only be listed once per single eating event and where
all drink only eating events were removed.
Topic models were estimated for each of
the three modified datasets using 10 topics and an initial
α
of 0.1, as these parameters

Detecting types of eating events
gave the lowest perplexity for the original full dataset and therefore allows comparison
with the results from each modified dataset.
The discovered eating event types for
each dataset were visualised and evaluated qualitatively and were all
considered to
be representative of
typical
eating events.
To compare the results,
each of
the 10
discovered eating event types in the four datasets were subjectively mapped by the
author, based on their content, to one of four eating event type labels:
‘Main meal’,
‘Light meal’, ‘Breakfast’ and ‘Snack’ as shown in table 6.2
For each of the four eating event type labels the top food groups for all of the dis-
covered eating event types mapped to the label were used to compare the probability
distribution over these most relevant food groups.
These distributions were compared
visually by plotting them for each relevant eating event type label on one graph,
as
shown in section 6.2.2.2.
Furthermore, a ten-fold cross validation was conducted for
each dataset.
The results were used to calculate the average perplexity across all folds
for a range of numbers of eating event types and were compared across datasets.

to have a high semantic quality.
Examples of
eating event types detected by this
model
are given in figures 6.5 - 6.7.
The full
results are provided in appendix C.2.
The discovered eating event types can vary widely in their semantic quality; some are
very obviously representative of a particular type of eating event, whereas others are
more ambiguous.
The three examples shown have been assigned a subjective label to
best describe their content.
The eating event type in figure 6.5 is representative of
breakfast and has a high semantic quality.
The eating event type in figure 6.6 is also semantically coherent and appears
132
6.2.
Detecting types of eating events
to reflect a snacking event.
Finally,
the eating event type in figure 6.7 appears to
be of
a lower semantic quality as it involves a wide mixture of
food groups,
which
have relatively low probabilities,
as shown by the size of
the fonts.
However,
such
discovered combinations of food groups can also provide useful
insight as they may
reveal patterns which are common but not necessarily well known or intuitive.
Figures 6.8 and 6.9, show how the fifteen eating event types found by this model
vary over time, demonstrating the probability of eating event types at different times
of day.
It should be noted that the labels for the eating event types were assigned
subjectively based on their most probable food groups.
Furthermore,
the frequency
of eating events is not considered, hence a high probability of an eating event type at
2am does not necessarily correspond to a large number of this type of eating event.
Rather, of those eating events that do occur, it is most likely to be of this type.
For
some times of day no eating events occurred and therefore a probability cannot be
given.
It can be seen in figure 6.8 that during the early morning period the eating event
types labelled as ‘breakfast’
have a high probability in comparison to other topics.
These breakfast eating event types then generally have a lower probability at all other
times.
Similarly, the eating event types labelled as ‘lunch/sandwiches’ have peaks in
probability around the middle of the day.
However,
these peaks are not as defined
as those for breakfast.
This suggests that there is more uncertainty in the type of
eating events that occur at this time of day.
In fact, the eating event types labelled

as ‘snacks’
are also quite probable at this time.
This is probably a combination of
people consuming what is considered a snack rather than lunch and the wide range of
times over which lunch type eating events occur.
Overall, the snacks topics are more
variable in probability throughout the full 24 hour period, this seems to fit with the
cultural idea of snacking.
Figure 6.9 highlights the peaks in probabilities more clearly, by displaying a matrix
representation of the eating event types against time,
where the colour corresponds
to the probability, as given by the values in the legend.
For example, it can be seen
that the two types of eating events labelled as ‘breakfast’
have distinctive peaks in
probability at different times.
One has a dominant peak around 7 - 8am, whereas the
other is more dominant either side of these times.
This difference could highlight a

link between the type of breakfast and the time consumed.
It can also be seen that
one of the main meal type of eating events has stronger probabilities than the others.
These visualisations and observations provide a starting point for further analysis by
nutritionists.
Figure 6.10 displays the results of the ten-fold cross validation conducted for the
selected document structure and vocabulary at sampling intervals of 5 eating event
types.
It can be seen that at this resolution the average perplexity is lowest for 10
eating event types.
The more detailed analysis based on this value,
with sampling
intervals of 1 eating event type, shows that the average perplexity oscillates between 5
and 16 eating event types.
However, it should be noted that the scale of the average
perplexity has a small
range (0.6) and therefore the number of
eating event types
does not have a strong effect on how well the model generalises to previously unseen
data.
The average perplexity for 15 eating event types, the number chosen based on
the qualitative analysis,
is very similar to the lowest average perplexity indicating
that using 15 types is valid.

The
full results are provided in appendix C.1.
The top 10 food groups are displayed with
font size proportional
to the probability of the food group in the eating event type
and based on these a subjective label is assigned.
Figure 6.11 shows an eating event
type labelled as ‘breakfast’, however it can be seen that this is quite a different type
of
breakfast,
compared to figure 6.5 as it is dominated by food groups relating to
a cup of tea or coffee and taking dietary supplements.
Figure 6.12 gives an eating
event type labelled as a ‘main meal’,
as it includes cooked vegetables and pasta or
rice.
Both of
these eating event types are considered to have quite good semantic
quality as it is relatively easy to apply a subjective label.
The eating event type in
figure 6.13 is labelled as ‘snacks’
and is considered to have a high semantic quality
as several food groups have relatively high probabilities and the top eight words are
typical of what are often considered snacking foods or drinks [202].
Figures 6.14 and 6.15 show the variation in probability of
the 10 eating event
types over time.
These are very similar to the patterns seen for 15 eating event
types.
The structure of each type is listed in full for both models in appendices C.1
and C.2.
Table 6.3 lists the ordered subjective labels used in figures 6.8 and 6.15 and
the corresponding eating event type number for reference to the appendices.
It can
be seen in 6.14 that the breakfast eating event types have the highest probabilities
between 6 and 10am.
The probability of the snack eating event types are again more
varied throughout the day and the main meal eating event types have peaks during
the evening.
Figure 6.15 highlights that different types of main meals appear to have
stronger associations with different times of day,
for example,
an early dinner time
around 5pm or a later meal between 7 and 8pm.

repetitions and drinks removed (no drinks or repeat).
For each dataset 10 eating
event types are detected and subjectively mapped to the four labels.
The number
of
discovered eating event types that match to a specific label
will
vary between
datasets.
Each label can have more than one eating event type mapped to it for each
dataset,
therefore these are numbered successively.
For example,
the dataset with
drink only events removed has three eating event types mapped to the ‘Breakfast’
label, hence these are referred to as ‘No drinks 1’, ‘No drinks 2’ and ‘No drinks 3’.
Figure 6.16 shows that for the ‘breakfast’ label, the distributions over the vocab-
ulary appear to vary as much between two eating event types created from the same
dataset as they do between eating event types from different datasets.
In particu-
lar,
looking at the ‘tea,
coffee and water’
food group,
it can be seen that this has a
strong probability in several eating event types, including those from datasets which
had drink only events removed.
All of the datasets contain at least one eating event
type with a relatively high probability of
food groups related to breakfast cereals
and another with a low probability for the same food groups.
Similarly for the ‘light
meal’ label, figure 6.17 shows that the variation in distributions is not clearly related
to the dataset.
Again,
removing drink only events does not necessarily reduce the
probability of the ‘tea,
coffee and water’
food group.
Removing repetitions of food
groups within an eating event may have had an impact on the probability of the food
group related to salad,
however this can also have a low probability in topics from
datasets where this restriction was not applied.
The range of
distributions over the vocabulary does not appear to be linked to
the dataset for the ‘main meal’
label
either,
as demonstrated by figure 6.18.

Chapter summary
example, there are several eating event types with a focus on food groups related to
potatoes and vegetables from a variety of datasets.
There are also eating event types
with a focus on pasta/rice and vegetable food groups in each dataset,
although the
probability of vegetables is a little lower for the eating event types from datasets with
repetitions removed.
Figure 6.19 highlights that there are eating event types with
the ‘snacks’
label
with similar distributions estimated from different datasets.
For
example, the third eating event type from the dataset using all the original data (All
3) and the first eating event type from the dataset with only repetitions removed (No
repeat 1) are very alike.

As well
as the qualitative comparison of the different datasets,
figure 6.20 shows
the results of the ten-fold cross validation performed on each dataset.
It can be seen
that removing either repeated food groups or drink only events corresponds to an
increase in the perplexity across the range of number of eating event types.
Further-
more, removing both repetitions and drink only events increases the perplexity further
again.
Hence, using all of the original data gives the best generalised performance on
previously unseen documents.

Chapter summary
This chapter has considered the application of LDA to a different data source, namely
nutrition data, with the aim of revealing patterns in the combinations of food groups
consumed together in different types of eating events.
The critical importance of the
selection of a vocabulary and document structure for the LDA model
when using a
143
6.3.
Chapter summary
new type of data has been shown.
In particular,
the exact context and aim of the
task should always be taken into account.
One key result that can be applied to
other data types is to ensure that all of the assumptions of LDA are completely met,
in particular,
that documents exhibit multiple topics.
This will
depend on what a
topic has been defined to be for a particular application but should be given careful
consideration.
Moreover, the selection of the vocabulary will have a strong impact on
the semantic quality of the resulting topics.
For example, a large vocabulary may not
be suitable as the resulting topics are likely to not be specific enough.
It is important
to consider the choice of vocabulary in the context of the application and to recognise
that documents use a bag of word representation which has no structure modelled.
It has been demonstrated by the results presented in this chapter that it is possible
to apply topic models to nutrition data from food diaries in order to find topics
that are representative of different types of eating events.
This was done using the
NDNS RP dataset, which contains a sample of food diaries representative of the UK
population.
Different methods of
visualising the resulting eating event types have
been shown.
This includes listing the top food groups of an eating event type with
the font size in proportion to the probability of
the food group and displaying the
variation in probability of eating event types with the time of day.
This has confirmed
that the topics found intuitively correspond to typical eating event types, as confirmed
by a nutritionist expert with experience in looking at different combinations of food
groups in the context of eating events.
Finally,
a sensitivity analysis of
the effect of
different properties of
the original
dataset was conducted.
In particular,
repeated food groups in a single eating event
and drink only events were removed from the data and the results were compared.
Overall,
from both the qualitative and quantitative analysis there is no evidence
that altering the dataset properties improves the performance of
the topic models.
Therefore, as making changes could cause unforeseen consequences it was concluded
that utilising the full dataset is the most appropriate option.

Chapter 7
Exploring and Validating Eating
Event Types
In chapter 6,
it was demonstrated that topic models can be applied to nutrition
data to find topics representative of types of eating events.
This initial research was
done using the NDNS RP dataset.
This chapter extends this work by considering
further visualisations and analysis that can be conducted to exploit these results.
For
example, the dataset can be separated into subsets based on the type of day, weekday
or weekend day, in order to compare the number of each type of eating event within
these groups.
In addition, inference can be performed on a per person basis to look at
the specific eating event types for an individual.
The aim is to highlight a variety of
different ways that the eating event types discovered by topic models can be used for
nutrition research, rather than answering a specific nutrition based research question.
Furthermore, the application of topic models to two other existing nutrition datasets
is considered to validate that the methods for selecting a vocabulary and document
structure extend to datasets with different properties.
Alternative approaches to iden-
tifying eating event types have previously been used with the selected datasets and
can be compared with the results from topic models.
Firstly,
a manual
rule-based
labelling approach to identify types of
eating event was previously applied to the
UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) 2000 dataset [202].
Secondly, topic
models are implemented for the Irish National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) [183]
because this dataset includes subjective labels for each eating event recorded as part
of the original data collection procedure.

Exploring the NDNS RP dataset using discovered eating event types
7.1
Exploring the NDNS RP dataset using
discovered eating event types
The eating event types that have been discovered using topic models can be used to
analyse the NDNS RP dataset in more detail.
The food group combinations found
using the model with 15 eating event types, presented in section 6.2.2.1, are used as
these were considered to be the most semantically coherent results.
The eating event
type labels assigned to the discovered combinations of food groups are also considered
in the analysis,
however these labels are used with caution due to their subjective
nature.
7.1.1
Inference for individuals
One avenue for exploring the dataset using the results from the topic model
is to
perform inference at an individual
person level.
Documents can be created based
on single eating events,
although this does not match with the assumption that a
document will
exhibit multiple topics,
these will
only be used for inference,
rather
than estimating a model and allow an eating event type to be associated with every
eating event.
Each person will
have a different number of
documents,
depending
on the number of
eating events they recorded across the four day food diary.
For
example, participant one recorded 27 eating events over a four day period.
7.1.1.1
Visualising the types of eating events for an individual
The results of inference at the individual level can be used to investigate an individ-
ual’s eating behaviour patterns by visualising the type of
eating events discovered.
Figure 7.1 shows the most likely eating event type for every eating event recorded by
participant one on the first day of their food diary.
For every eating event the original
food groups of the items consumed in that event, as listed in the food diary, the time
of the event and the most likely eating event type found by inference, along with the
corresponding subjective label are given.
For example,
at 13:30 the participant had
a piece of fruit,
a soft drink and two items of sugar confectionery.
This was found
to most likely be eating event type 10,
which was subjectively labelled as a snack.
Intuitively,
this label
seems to be a good match to the items consumed during the
eating event.
The subjective labels for the eating events at 07:45 and 11:08 are less intuitive.
The event at 07:45 is likely to be considered breakfast due to the food group com-

binations and the time of
the event.
However,
it can be seen why the most likely
eating event type found during inference was one that was subjectively labelled as
lunch/sandwiches,
because the bread and spread could easily be part of a sandwich
rather than toast.
Similarly,
the event at 11:08 is assigned to most likely be eating
event type 8,
which is subjectively labelled as a light meal.
This event has food
groups that could form part of a light meal,
however this is much more likely to be
labelled as a snack by a participant or researcher.
The results for this participant highlight the complexity and subjective nature of
analysing food and drink intake at a meal level due to different behaviour patterns.
This participant has recorded three separate eating events between 11.30 and 15:00.
Considering the content of these eating events it appears that the participant probably
spread their ‘lunch’ over this extended period as a series of smaller eating events.
In
particular, bread, spread and bacon/ham are listed at both 11:30 and 15:00 suggesting
that the participant ate one sandwich late morning and another in the afternoon.
The total content of these three eating events could be equivalent to one eating event
recorded by a different participant,
either because they ate everything together or
just recorded it as eaten at one time for ease.
If the nutrition intake was considered
at a day level
this would be equivalent overall,
however the behaviour of

Exploring the NDNS RP dataset using discovered eating event types
series of smaller eating events could be linked to health outcomes and hence this meal
level information is important.
The traditional labels of lunch and snack may not be
appropriate for reflecting this eating behaviour pattern.
Figure 7.2 shows the eating events for day two of the food diary for participant
one.
This shows that,
similarly to the first day,
the subjective labels for the most
likely eating event type correspond well to the content of each eating event.
Again,
one exception is the event that is most likely to be type 8 that occurs at 21:29, which
also appears to be more likely to be considered a snack rather than a light meal.
Comparing the results for the two days it can be seen that this participant has little
consistency or routine in the type and time of their eating events across these two

days.
Referring back to the original data reveals that these entries are for a Saturday
and Sunday respectively.
This may influence the type and number of eating events
that occurred [193].
Figure 7.3 highlights the most likely eating event types across the whole four days
of participant one’s food diary.
It can be seen from this plot that there are no strong
patterns of the time and type of eating events for this participant over the four day
period.
Figure 7.4 shows the eating events for a different participant for all four days
of their food diary.
It can be seen that this participant is very different from the first
example.
Firstly,
this participant has far fewer eating events across the four days,
a total
of
14 compared to 27 for the other participant.
Secondly,
this participant
demonstrates a much stronger routine and consistency in their eating events.
Both
the content and the time of their eating events are frequently very similar or the same.
All of the subjective labels for the most likely eating event types for this participant
match well to the items consumed during the events.
A random sample of
the participants was selected and the detailed content of
their eating events were investigated.
For brevity visualisations of all of these are not
included here as the aim is to demonstrate different types of
analysis that the use
of topic models can facilitate, rather than undertaking a full analysis of the dataset.
It was found that overall
the majority of
the subjective labels for the most likely
eating event types match well to the items consumed during the eating events.

150
7.1.
Exploring the NDNS RP dataset using discovered eating event types
exceptions found included an eating event containing only fruit, which was inferred to
most likely be eating event type 15, lunch/sandwiches.
Many people would probably
consider one piece of fruit a snack, however it was consumed at 13:35 so the participant
could have considered this lunch and hence the subjective label
inferred would be
correct.
This highlights the lack of
clarity of
subjective labels.
Another exception
detected was the occurrence of eating events that contain the items used to bake a
home made cake listed separately, which were inferred to most likely be a main meal.
This is because the food groups of the recipe items do match the food groups likely
to be in a main meal and the topic model has no other context.
This problem could
be solved by listing such items as the finished product,
i.e.
cake,
rather than the
individual ingredients.
7.1.1.2
Investigating the effect of morning eating event types
In addition to visualising the eating events for a specific individual, the results of in-
ference at the individual level can be used for further analysis across the full sample
population.
For example,
nutritionists are often interested in the effect of breakfast
and how this influences what someone eats for the rest of the day [230].
To demon-
strate how the results from topic models can provide a new approach to this research
area, an initial analysis was conducted.
No direct nutritional conclusions are drawn,
as this is not the focus of
this thesis,
but this approach could be utilised by the
nutrition research community to address relevant hypotheses.
The most likely eating event type for each eating event for all
participants was
determined using the individual inference results.
For each day of every participant’s
food diary the eating events that occurred between 6am and 10am were selected
and the most common eating event type amongst these was identified.
Based on
this information the eating events recorded for that day were put into one of three
categories:
none,
breakfast or other.
This reflected whether the participant had no
eating events,
mostly breakfast type events or mostly other types of
events within
this time period.
The most likely eating event type for each of the remaining eating
events for the rest of the day were then listed for the corresponding category.
Figure 7.5 shows the average number of
each of
the 15 eating event types per
day for each of
the three categories.
Each of
the categories:
none,
breakfast and
other,
contained 2997,
8401 and 5141 days respectively.
It can be seen that the
distribution of
eating event types varies across the categories.
Overall,
the none
category has lower average numbers of eating events across all types.
This suggests
that people who do not consume anything between 6am and 10am generally have
fewer total number of eating events in a day than those who consume something in

this time period.
However,
this analysis does not take energy content into account.
Nutrition researchers could take this idea further to investigate whether fewer eating
events correlate to a lower daily energy intake.
Figure 7.5 also reveals that those
who primarily have eating event types that are not breakfast between 6am and 10am
have a higher average number of snack eating event types across the rest of the day.
Again, further analysis would be required to draw any conclusions from this, as many
of these eating events may have a low energy content.
In summary, the results of inference at the individual level has shown that in gen-
eral there is a good match between the food groups consumed in an eating event and
the subjective label for the most likely eating event type.
This provides further con-
firmation that topic models can successfully be used to detect combinations of food
groups reflective of different types of eating events.
Furthermore, it has been demon-
strated that the discovered eating event types provide a basis for further analysis at
both the individual and population level.
In particular, they can help to identify and
investigate eating behaviour patterns for an individual.
This could be extended to

is linked to a lower daily energy intake” can be investigated using the discovered
eating event types.
7.1.2
Investigating differences between weekdays and
weekends
In addition to performing inference at the individual level the dataset can be explored
by performing inference for different groups based on a variable of
interest.
The
original
method of
document creation,
using all
items consumed at time
t
for any
person on any day,
is applied to each group.
Visualising the results from inference
on the groups can highlight differences between them.
For example, the dataset can
be grouped based on the day of
the week variable,
with all
of
the weekdays from
Monday through Friday in one group and the weekend days,
Saturday and Sunday
in a second group.

Figure 7.6 shows the most likely eating event type for all

This highlights that there are many
similarities in the types of eating events that occur on both weekdays and weekend
days.
However,
there are some differences which may be of
interest to nutrition
researchers.
In particular, it can be seen that on weekend days the period of time for
which breakfast is the most likely eating event type is longer than on weekdays.
This
could suggest that people have less of a routine at the weekend and this may in turn

impact what is consumed for the remainder of
the day.
Nutritionists could utilise
these eating event types to investigate this at a higher level than has previously been
possible when using the raw data directly [231].
One of the benefits of LDA is its probabilistic nature, that allows the uncertainty in
the data to be modelled.
For example, the model can accommodate the fact that not
everyone eats the same food at the same time for breakfast.
The probabilities of the
eating event types found from performing inference on weekend days and weekdays
can be visualised at different times of day, as shown in figures 7.7 and 7.8 respectively.

Figure 7.9:
Differences between probabilities of 15 eating event types at different times
of day.
Positive values (yellow and green) indicate higher probability for weekend and
negative values (blue) for weekdays.
Comparing these graphs provides a more detailed insight into the differences that were
identified in figure 7.6.
For example, on weekdays there are two strong peaks of the
snack event type either side of peaks for the lunch/sandwiches and light meal event
types.
Whereas,
at the weekend there is more uncertainty between all
of the event
types around midday.
Additionally,
more detail
between the probability of the two
different breakfast eating event types can be seen on these graphs, than is summarised
by visualising only the most likely eating event types.
In order to quantify the observed variation in probabilities between weekdays and
weekends the differences between the two groups are calculated.
These are visualised
as a matrix of eating event types at different times, as shown in figure 7.9.
A positive
value,
green and yellow squares,
indicates that this eating event type is more likely
at this time of
day on a weekend day.
Vice versa,
a negative value,
blue squares,
indicates that the eating event type is more likely at this time of day on a weekday.
For example,
at 5am one of
the eating event types,
labelled as breakfast,
is a lot
more probable on a weekend than on a weekday.
Conversely,
at the same time the
eating event type drinks and snacks is more likely to occur on a weekday.
The matrix
visualisation shows that overall there is not much difference between the probabilities
for each type of
day.
Moreover,
the larger differences in probability tend to occur
between midnight and 6am,
during which period less eating events tend to occur,
meaning there are fewer samples and hence each event will have a larger impact on
the probability.

Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
In summary, this section has demonstrated that performing inference on different
groups can reveal
patterns that are useful
for further analysis.
In particular,
it has
been shown that there are differences between the probabilities of eating event types
that occur on weekday and weekend days.
The eating event types discovered by a
topic model
can be used by nutritionists as a basis to investigate when and where
these food group combinations are consumed, their average energy and other variables
of
interest.
Understanding the patterns of
consumption for the UK population on
average can help to influence policy on nutrition and dietary advice.
7.2
Validating application of topic models to
nutrition data
It has been shown that topic models can be applied to food diary data from the
NDNS RP dataset to identify combinations of food groups that are representative of
different types of eating events.
The results have been qualitatively and quantitatively
evaluated and demonstrate that this method is successful.
However,
it is necessary
to both confirm that this method extends to other datasets and validate the results
against other approaches.
There is no gold standard within the nutrition research
community for identifying eating event types,
as discussed in section 3.3.3.
The
discovered eating events are validated against the results of
other techniques [202]
and subjective labels given by participants [183].
Several datasets were considered for the purposes of validation.
The United States
National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [232]
has datasets available for
every year from 1999 to present.
However, the details of the survey change each year,
only 2 days of food diary data are collected for each participant using the 24 hour
dietary recall
method and the food groups are not given explicitly in the dataset.
The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study [180]
has
datasets from 10 different countries, however there is only one 24 hour dietary recall
for each participant.
Using a different method of data collection, dietary recall instead
of food diaries, means that the comparison between the results may be less valid and
hence these datasets were not selected for the validation.
The UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2000 (NDNS 2000) [233] and the Irish
National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) [183] were chosen for use as validation sets.
Details of these datasets are provided in sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 respectively.
Both of
these datasets included four or seven day food diary data, making comparisons across
the datasets easier.
Moreover, these datasets have previously had alternative manual
approaches to identifying eating event types applied to them,
hence enabling direct
156
7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
comparisons between the results of the different methods.
Whilst there are similarities
between the datasets,
there are also differences in the food lists and coding of food
groups,
particularly for the NANS dataset.
Therefore,
they can both be used for
validation but direct comparisons between them are more difficult.
7.2.1
Validation using UK National Diet and Nutrition
Survey 2000 dataset
The UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2000 is the predecessor to the NDNS RP
dataset used for the initial work.
It was a cross sectional survey of a representative
sample of the UK adult (aged 19 - 64 years) population living in private households.
The survey investigated the food consumption, nutrient intake and nutritional status
of
participants over a 12-month period between 2000 and 2001.
This included the
completion of 7-day weighed dietary records of food intake.
Participants were pro-
vided with accurately calibrated weighing scales and instructions on how to weigh
food,
drinks and leftovers.
Full
details of how the survey was conducted and all
of
the data collected is available from the UK dataservice and was accessed under usage
number 87742 [233].
From the full
eligible sample in the survey,
1724 participants
completed the full
seven day weighed food diary.
The data from the diaries were
coded by trained individuals using a list of food codes for 6000 items,
provided by
the survey organisers.
Composite items were split into individual
components,
for
example a cup of tea may be recorded as tea infusion, milk and sugar [234].
7.2.1.1
Methods for comparing manual rule based and topic model
labels
A manual
rule based classification method for identifying eating events as meals,
snacks or drinks has recently been applied to this dataset [202].
This method involved
allocating all of the food groups in the NDNS 2000 dataset to the most relevant list
selected from meal, snack and drink, based on expert knowledge.
The lists are given
in appendix B.3 for reference.
Dietary supplements were not included in this analysis.
In the published work eating events were considered to be all items consumed within
every 60 minute period,
but this method was also applied for eating events defined
as all items consumed at a unique time.
The results based on eating events at unique
times were used to facilitate comparison with the work described in this thesis.
The
following rules were then applied to label an eating event as a meal, snack or drink:
Meal
All items from meal list OR
More than one item and at least one item from meal list EXCEPT
157
7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
Two items only, one each from meal and snack lists (e.g.
bread and butter)
Snack All items from snack list OR
Two items only, one each from meal and snack lists
Drink All items from drink list OR
Two items only, one each from drink and snack lists (e.g.
sugar in coffee)
Although the analysis presented in [202]
excludes several
of the participants due
to missing non-dietary data, the full sample was used in this work as all dietary data
was complete.
The manual rule based labels, assigned using the above method, for all
participants was provided by Dr Laura Johnson, University of Bristol, a collaborator
for this PhD thesis.
In order to be able to draw comparisons and generalise the
results across the datasets investigated,
the same approach was taken to applying
topic models to this dataset as used for the NDNS RP dataset.
Documents were
constructed from the items consumed in all
of
the eating events that occurred at
every unique time
t
,
as recorded to the nearest minute,
for any participant on any
day, giving a total of 1148 documents.
The vocabulary consists of the 57 food groups
found in the NDNS 2000 dataset, which are broadly the same as those in the NDNS
RP dataset and are listed in appendix B.2 for reference.
The C implementation of variational inference for LDA from David Blei [51] was
also used for this dataset for consistency.
A ten-fold cross validation was conducted
using the method described in 6.2.1,
with 114 documents in each fold.
The average
perplexity was calculated for a range of eating event types from 5 to 50 and is shown
by blue crosses in figure 7.10.
It can be seen that the perplexity is lowest for between

5 and 10 eating event types, but that it does not increase much for the full range of
numbers.
This suggests that the model
generalises to previously unseen data best
when using 5 or 10 eating event types, however the number of types does not have a
strong effect,
as for the previous dataset.
A more detailed cross validation was also
conducted for between 1 and 15 eating event types at 1 type intervals, shown by red
diamonds in figure 7.10.
This confirms that between 5 and 10 types gives the lowest
perplexity, with the minimum at 7 types.
In addition a qualitative analysis was also conducted for the dataset.
The results of
estimating models using 5, 10 and 15 eating event types were visualised as lists of the
top food groups with font size proportional to the probability of the food group, given
in appendices C.3 - C.5.
These were evaluated for their semantic coherence and given
subjective labels using the same types as for the previous dataset,
as summarised
in table 7.1.
All of the eating event types found were considered to be semantically
coherent, however the model with 5 eating event types is a limited representation as
there are no event types associated with lighter meals.
For comparison with the manual
rule-based classification method it is necessary
to map the eating event types given in table 7.1 to the three simple types used for
the rules.
Therefore, breakfast, lunch/sandwiches, light meal and main meal were all
mapped to the label meal;
whilst drinks and snacks remained with the same labels.
The NDNS 2000 dataset was restructured into documents that were created based on
single eating events, in the same way as described in section 7.1.1.
These documents

Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
were used to perform inference and determine the most likely eating event type for
every eating event.
This was completed for the models estimated using 5, 10 and 15
eating event types.
The simple eating event type labels (meal, snack, drink) for each
eating event could then be directly compared with the label given to the same eating
event using the manual rule-based method.
7.2.1.2
Results and discussion of comparison between manual rule
based and topic model labels
Table 7.2 shows the percentage of
eating events that were given the same label
by
both the manual
method and the topic model
approach,
using the mapped simple
labels.
The model with 15 original eating event types has the highest similarity to the
manual
rule-based method.
This suggests that although the eating event types are
mapped onto only three labels, starting with a large number of types when estimating
the model can still provide benefit.

For each of the models, table 7.3 shows a matrix with the fraction of eating events
for each manual
label
that matched each of the mapped simple labels for the most
likely eating event type assigned by the model.
For example,
for all
of

of
‘Meal’,
the fraction of
labels assigned
using the topic model
with 5 different eating event types are 0.84 for ‘Meal’,

7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
for ‘Drink’ and 0.16 for ‘Snack’, as shown by the first row of the first matrix.
These
results highlight where the differences occurred between the two labelling methods.
For all
of the models it can be seen that meals are the most likely to be given the
same label by both methods.
There is a much larger disagreement for the drink label,
but the agreement for this improves as the number of eating event types in the model
increases.
This is likely to be because the eating event types discovered become more
specific when a larger number are found.
The agreement for the snack label seems to
vary and is highest for the model with 5 eating event types.
However, the manual rule-based method would not be considered a gold standard.
When investigating the details of the eating events that are given different labels it
can be seen that identifying which method is correct is very subjective and not always
possible to determine.
Table 7.4 summarises some examples of eating events that are
given different labels by each method.
These are discussed in further detail here.
In general,
it was observed that eating events with only one item often cause

7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
confusion for both methods.
In particular,
the manual
rule-based method assumes
that a meal will have at least two items and therefore incorrectly labels some eating
events which would subjectively be considered a meal, such as ready meals, pizza or
a ‘Big Mac’.
Example 1 in table 7.4 shows a ready meal, which is labelled as a snack
by the manual method.
In these cases, the topic model approach performs better as
it labels the eating event as a meal.
However,
in other instances of one item eating
events,
notably drinks,
the topic model
will
give a label
of meal,
although drink is
more appropriate, as demonstrated by example 2.
The manual
rule-based method will
label
an eating event with two items,
where
one is a drink item and the other a snack item,
as a drink,
in order to account for
people who have sugar in their hot drink.
However, this does not cover cases where
a hot drink is listed as several separate components, such as in example 4, where the
manual label is incorrectly given as snack.
For this example, the topic model approach
correctly labels this eating event as a drink when using the 5 eating event type model
but incorrectly gives the label meal for the models with 10 or 15 eating event types.
Moreover, this rule also misses cases where a drink and snack are consumed, such as
in example 3.
This is correctly labelled by the topic model method.
Other eating events are less obviously of a particular type and therefore it is not
possible to say which label is correct.
Examples 5, 6 and 7 in table 7.4 highlight some
common types of eating events that have this problem.
The addition of medicine to
the eating event in example 5 makes it ambiguous as to whether it is still just a drink
or should be considered a snack.
It is possible that removing all medicine items from
the dataset would be appropriate for this analysis.
However a decision would then
need to be made as to whether the associated water was relevant.
Example 6 is also ambiguous as some people would eat this combination of foods
as a snack, whilst others would consider it to be a lunchtime meal.
Therefore, giving
an eating event like this a label
is difficult and not necessarily that meaningful.
Similarly for example 7,
some people might have marmite on toast and coffee for
breakfast, whereas another person might have this as an evening snack.
However, for
this eating event the models with 5 and 10 eating event types label
this as a drink,
which is incorrect.
In general, the models with less types appear to be more likely to
label eating events that are meals or snacks as drinks.
Finally, example 8 demonstrates a problem with eating events where soup is con-
sumed and there are not many items in total.
These are often labelled incorrectly by
the topic model approach.
This may be because the food group that soup is part of is
‘miscellaneous’ and this food group also contains savoury sauces, condiments and dry
beverages, such as hot chocolate powder.
Therefore, it is not discriminatory enough
162
7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
and causes confusion in the model.
Whereas the rule based approach utilises the 115
sub food groups and hence soups are explicitly assigned to the meal list.
Redefining
the food groups used specifically for applying topic models to find eating event types
could improve the results by avoiding such ambiguities but still maintaining a small
vocabulary.
In summary,
this section has shown that the results found in chapter 6 extend
to a different dataset.
Topic models have successfully been applied to the NDNS
2000 dataset to find combinations of food groups representative of different types of
eating events.
The method was easily applied to this new dataset,
even though the
vocabulary was different, the food diary records were for seven days rather than four
and the survey only included adults aged 19 - 64 years.
Furthermore,
it has been
demonstrated that the eating event types found by the topic model are comparable
to those found using a manual
rule-based approach in up to 71% of cases.
Using a
model with a larger number of topics gives a higher agreement between eating events
labelled as drink because the discovered eating event types are more specific.
For
some eating events the topic model
results are correct when the rule-based method
fails.
Finally,
the subjective nature of
labelling eating event types is shown to not be
applicable for all situations as often the same items will be consumed but considered
different types of
events.
This suggests that using the eating event types found
directly,
rather than applying labels to them could be more insightful
when using
these results for further analysis.
However, this can cause problems for nutritionists
when trying to communicate guidelines for policies to a lay audience as it is normal
to use these labels for communicating such ideas.
7.2.2
Validation using Irish National Adult Nutrition
Survey dataset
The Irish National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) was conducted by the Irish Uni-
versities Nutrition Alliance (IUNA) to investigate food consumption,
lifestyle and
health of a representative sample of the population of the Republic of Ireland.
The
survey ran from 2008 - 2010 and recruited 1500 free-living adults aged 18 - 90 years,
excluding women who were pregnant or breastfeeding.
Participants completed a four-
day semi-weighed food diary, weighing food items when possible, using manufacturers
information or a food atlas to estimate weights otherwise.
Participants were asked
to define the type of each eating event and this was coded at the time of input to the
database.
Full details of the survey are available in the summary report [183].

7.2.2.1
Methods for comparing participant defined and topic model
labels
The data from the food diaries for all 1500 participants were coded using the WISP
(Tinuviel
Software),
using a total
of
2552 items.
The data was recorded at the
item level
in an SPSS Statistics (IBM) database and the relevant variables were
extracted for processing in Matlab (v2014b, The Mathworks Inc.).
The same method
of applying topic models as used for both NDNS datasets was utilised for this dataset
for consistency.
Documents were constructed by identifying every unique time, to the
nearest minute as recorded, in the dataset and selecting all of the eating events that
occurred at this time.
The food groups for every item consumed during each of
the eating events were listed to create the document.
The dataset contains 68 food
groups and a reduced set of 19 food groups.
The full
set was used for creating the
documents (listed in appendix B.2 for reference) as this was most similar to the
NDNS food groups,
however there are differences in the food groupings,
which are
highlighted in section 7.2.3.
Overall, there were 539 documents for the full dataset.
The same implementation of
variational
inference for LDA was used as for the
previous datasets for consistency.
A ten-fold cross validation was conducted using
the method described in 6.2.1, with 53 documents in each fold.
The average perplexity
for 5 to 50 eating event types, at intervals of 5 was calculated across all folds, as shown
by blue crosses in figure 7.11.
It can be seen that the perplexity is lowest for 5 eating
event types but that it does not increase much across the full range.
This is similar
to the previous datasets and suggests that the model generalises to previously unseen

data best when using 5 eating event types, however it is not strongly affected by the
number of eating event types.
A more detailed cross validation was conducted for 1
to 15 eating event types and is shown by red diamonds in figure 7.11.
This confirms
that the lowest average perplexity value is at 5 types.
In addition to quantitative evaluation, it is also important to qualitatively analyse
the results.
Therefore, models were estimated using 5, 10 and 15 eating event types
and the results were visualised as lists of the top food groups with font size propor-
tional to the probability of the food group, given in appendices C.6 - C.8.
These were
evaluated for their semantic coherence and given subjective labels using the same
types as for the previous datasets, as summarised in table 7.5.
All of the eating event
types found were considered to be semantically coherent.
However the model with 5
eating event types has less variety, in particular meat based food groups only appear
once in the top food groups of any eating event type.
The results of the model with
15 types was judged by nutrition experts to be the most useful, particularly because
it contained an eating event type for drink only events.
The label
for the type of
each eating event as defined by the participants was
coded to be one of eleven options (the meal type labels listed in column two of table
7.6).
These are different in nature to the labels used to subjectively name the eating
event types found by a topic model because they focus more on the time of day.
For
example,
there are four types of snacks that only differ by the time of day they are

In order to make comparisons between the two approaches, a reduced
set of
simple labels was identified,
to which the labels used in the two approaches
could be mapped.
The mappings between these different sets of labels are explicitly
defined in table 7.6.
Drinks and snacks are combined as only one discovered eating
event type represented only alcoholic drinks.
In order to compare the labels given to each eating event, documents were created
for each single eating event in the NANS dataset using the method described in
section 7.1.1.
Inference was performed on these documents using each of the three
estimated models,
with 5,
10 and 15 eating event types.
The most likely type was
determined for every eating event.
The mappings for the simple labels, given in table
7.6, were then applied to the results from the models and the ‘meal type’ variable in
the original dataset.
This allowed the simple labels to be directly compared for each
eating event to quantify the similarities between the model results and the participant
defined labels.
Table 7.7 shows the percentage of eating events that were mapped to
the same simple label.
The model with 5 eating event types has the highest similarity
to the participant defined labels when mapped to the simple label set.
The percentage
of matches decreases with the increase of the number of eating event types.
For each of the models,
table 7.8 shows a matching matrix detailing the fraction
of eating events for each simple label
(mapped from the participant defined labels)
that matched the simple labels (mapped from the most likely eating event type as-
signed by the model).
These results highlight that the majority of

increases is related to those eating events defined by participants as drinks or snacks.
As the number of eating event types discovered increases they become more specific.
For this dataset, the more specific eating event types found were more often subjec-
tively labelled as a type of
meal,
especially lunch or light meal
than as a snack or
drink.
These labels do not match as well
with how participants define their eating
events.
In particular,
an eating event defined as a snack by a participant can have
similar food groups to part of a meal, especially eating events with few items.
167
7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
Several
of
the more specific eating event types in the 15 type model
that were
labelled as lunch or light meal
contain food groups related to bread,
tea,
coffee,
milk,
sugar and spreads within the top food groups of
the eating event type.
The
subjective labels are assigned based on the distinguishing food groups, such as cheese,
bacon & ham,
soups and salad,
which generally have a lower probability within the
eating event type.
The eating event type discovered labelled as ‘snacks and drinks’
also contains tea and milk within the top food groups but is distinguished by the
chocolate confectionery, savoury snacks and cakes, pastries & buns food groups.
This
means that eating events that only have food groups such as bread,
spread and
tea have a higher chance of
being assigned a most likely eating event type with a
subjective label
of
light meal
or lunch.
This highlights the problem of
subjective,
cultural based labels as in reality people eat these same combinations of food groups
at many different times but associate different labels with them.
For example,
if a
person has toast and tea for breakfast or a night time snack, or a sandwich and tea
for lunch, they are consuming very similar food groups but using different labels.
Due to the subjective nature of the labels given to eating events by participants
and to the results from topic models by researchers, only matches and differences can
be quantified,
without stating that one is necessarily more correct than the other.
Investigating the components of the eating events given different labels gives further
insight into why these differences occur.
Table 7.9 gives some examples of
eating
events which were given different labels.
These are discussed in more detail below.
In the NANS dataset some items, such as milk and tea, are given average portion
sizes.
This means that if someone has a large mug of tea or two cups of tea in one
eating event then this item will
be listed more than once.
This artificially inflates
the representation of these items when creating documents at the eating event level,
affecting inference of
the most likely type of
eating event.
Example 1 in table 7.9
demonstrates this effect, as the distinguishing food group between a snack and a light
meal,
associated with the tuna food item,
only accounts for 11% of
the document
created for this eating event.
In addition, cream crackers are assigned to the biscuit
food group and hence will be associated by the model with a snack eating event type
rather than a light meal.
It was shown that, for the 10 and 15 type models, the majority of differences are
for eating events with participant defined labels mapped to the drink/snack simple
label.
Eating events with only one or two items often cause differences in labels,
especially for the 15 type model, as highlighted by examples 2 to 4 in table 7.9.
Each
of
these events were labelled by participants as drink/snack but assigned to light
meal,
breakfast or main meal
by the 15 type model.
The food groups for the items
in these eating events do not occur in the top food groups for the eating event types

mapped to the simple drink/snack label for this model.
Rather, they occur as part of
other types of eating events, for example fruit can be eaten as part of a main meal.
Therefore,
because these eating events only have one or two items there is no data
169
7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
that the model
associates with the drink/snack eating event type.
Conversely,
the
eating event types discovered by the 5 type model are less specific, hence those types
mapped to drink/snack include coffee and fruit.
Therefore, the model can associate
these eating events with the drink/snack types.
Example 5 in table 7.9 shows that for some eating events the label
assigned by
the model is arguably more realistic than the participant defined drink/snack label in
terms of the content of the eating event.
Another participant eating the same items
could consider the eating event to be a light meal.
This ambiguity due to the nature
of the subjective labels also occurs for other eating event types, as shown in examples
6 and 7.
Example 6 demonstrates that although the combination of tea,
bread and
marmalade is often consumed as breakfast this participant had the same items as
a light meal.
Similarly,
in example 7 a traditional
cooked breakfast is represented,
however in terms of
food groups it is clear that this is more like a light meal,
as
suggested by the model results.
Certain food groups that contain a wide range of
different items can cause dif-
ferences in labels,
such as example 8.
Coke and maple syrup belong to food groups
more generally associated with snacks than breakfast,
therefore the model
has as-
signed the most likely type to be snack/drink for this eating event.
Furthermore,
the NANS dataset contains some items for which the nutrition values are known at a
recipe level and hence are not split into their composite parts.
These items are only
listed as one food group in a document, rather than several which does not accurately
represent the eating event.
This is shown in example 8,
where the beef stew is the
main part of the meal but only has one item compared to the tea and biscuits, which
require three items.
Therefore the model
bases the assignment to the most likely
eating event type on the tea and biscuits rather than beef stew and considers it to
be a snack instead of a meal.
All datasets contain some inconsistencies, some of the inconsistencies in the NANS
dataset are clearly incorrect.
For example,
one participant who had porridge,
ba-
nanas,
pears,
honey and coffee for breakfast every morning has this eating event
labelled as a non-alcoholic beverage for day 3,
which is clearly a mistake.
Other
inconsistencies cannot be considered definitively incorrect without being able to refer
to the original food diary records.
For example, one participant had porridge, pasta
with tomato sauce and apples for their evening meal.
This does not seem like a
common combination, however it could be a valid entry.
In summary, this section has shown that topic models can be successfully applied
to the NANS dataset to find combinations of food groups representative of different
eating event types.
The subjective labels given to eating event types found are
170
7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
comparable to the subjective labels assigned by participants in up to 72% of cases.
In contrast, to the results for the NDNS 2000 dataset where as the number of eating
event types discovered increases the agreement between labels increases, for the NANS
dataset the agreement decreases.
This decrease in agreement primarily occurs for
drink/snack eating event types.
A model with a larger number of eating event types
discovers more specific combinations of food groups.
For the NDNS 2000 dataset this
meant that a more specific drink eating event type was discovered that increased the
number of matches for the drink label.
However,
for the NANS dataset having less
specific eating event types gives a better agreement with participant labels because
it reflects the increased variation from using participant defined labels,
rather than
standardised rule based labels.
The coding strategies vary a lot more between NANS and NDNS 2000 than be-
tween the two NDNS datasets because they are run by completely separate groups.
In particular,
the nature of the food groups varies in terms of what level
items are
grouped at e.g.
whether tea, coffee and water are all in one group or in three separate
groups.
The use of composite foods i.e.
whether a sandwich is listed as one item or
all of the component parts and average portion sizes are different.
These underlying
coding strategies affect the resulting eating event types discovered by a topic model
because they are directly linked with the vocabulary and document structure.
For
example,
if
average portion sizes are used then the corresponding food groups will
be repeated if
a participant has a double portion.
These differences have a more
noticeable effect when performing inference on documents representing single eating
events,
compared to the documents used to estimate the model,
because they are
much smaller and hence a repetition of one item will
be more significant in relative
terms.
Finally, as for the NDNS 2000 dataset, the results highlighted that using subjective
labels for eating events is not always applicable.
The same combination of food groups
may be consumed but given different labels based on cultural norms.
This problem
is compounded when both the participant based labels and labels assigned to the
eating event types found by topic models are subjective.
There is often no definitive
answer as to which is the ‘correct’ or ‘better’ label.
7.2.3
Using NDNS food groups with the NANS dataset
The are several
differences between the 68 food groups used in the NANS dataset
and those in the NDNS datasets.
For example,
in the NDNS datasets tea,
coffee
and water are one food group whereas in the NANS dataset these are three separate
food groups.
The opposite is true for alcoholic beverages,
which are separated into
171
7.2.
Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
several different groups in NDNS but all grouped together in NANS. These different
groupings affect the results of using topic models as the food groups are used as the
vocabulary.
For example, if a dataset contains 100 tea, 100 coffee and 100 water items
then this would result in the NDNS ‘tea,
coffee and water’
food group being listed
300 times in total,
whereas each of
the separate corresponding NANS food groups
would be listed 100 times each in total.
This change in the underlying structure of
the data affects how the model discovers the hidden structure of eating event types.
To investigate this further,
the food items in the NANS dataset were reassigned
to the NDNS RP food groups by a nutritionist.
There were a few unclear items that
required clarification before being assigned to the most appropriate group, including
splitting items into component parts where necessary.
For example,
the food item
‘cocoa powder,
made up with semi-skimmed milk’
in the NANS dataset was coded
to be NDNS RP food groups ‘Beverages dry weight’ and ‘Semi-skimmed milk’.
The
assigned groups for these additional
items were verified and agreed by a nutrition
expert, familiar with the NDNS dataset.
Using the 60 NDNS RP food groups as the vocabulary,
documents were created
for the NANS dataset.
Documents were constructed from the assigned food groups
of the items in all eating events at each unique time recorded in the dataset, to the
nearest minute.
Variational
inference for LDA was used to conduct a ten-fold cross
validation using the method described in 6.2.1, with 53 documents in each fold.
The
average perplexity for 5 to 50 eating event types,
at intervals of
5 was calculated
across all folds as shown by blue crosses in figure 7.12.
This shows the perplexity is
lowest for 5 eating event types, but does not increase much across the full range.

Validating application of topic models to nutrition data
A more detailed ten-fold cross validation was conducted and the average perplexity
calculated for 1 to 15 eating event types,
as shown by red diamonds in figure 7.12.
This confirms that the lowest perplexity is for 5 or 6 eating event types.
This is a
similar trend to previous datasets and models, suggesting that the model generalises
to previously unseen data best when using 5 eating event types, however the number
of types does not have a large impact.
Furthermore, comparing figure 7.12 to figure
7.11 highlights that the perplexity is lower across the whole range of
number of
eating event types when using the NDNS RP food group vocabulary as opposed to
the original NANS food groups.
This suggests that using the NDNS RP food groups
creates models that are a better fit to the NANS dataset.
A qualitative analysis of the results was also carried out by visualising the top food
groups for models estimated using 5,10 and 15 eating event types, given in appendices
C.9 - C.11.
All of the eating event types were considered to be semantically coherent.
The models with larger numbers of types displayed more specificity in the types found
in terms of food group combinations, as expected.
All of the eating event types were
given subjective labels using the same types as for previous datasets and these are
detailed in table 7.10.
To further investigate the impact of using the NDNS RP food groups as the vo-
cabulary for the NANS dataset,
the same analysis of comparing labels as described
in section 7.2.2.1 was conducted for the new models.
Table 7.11 summarises the per-

centage of eating events for which the final
mapped label
was the same for models
with 5, 10 and 15 event types.
It can be seen that as for the original NANS dataset
and vocabulary,
the model
with 5 eating event types has the highest similarity to
the participant defined labels when mapped to the simple label set.
The percentage
of matches also decreases with the increase of the number of eating events.
Overall
174
7.3.
Chapter summary
the percentage of matches is higher using the NDNS RP food groups, compared with
the original NANS food groups and the rate of decrease in the number of matches is
smaller.
This suggests that the structure of the data using these food groups enables
the topic models to discover hidden eating event types that are more aligned with
participant based labels.
A detailed break down of the fraction of matches for each simple label
are given
for each model in table 7.12.
These highlight that there is a similar decrease in the
fraction of matching drink/snack labels between the 5 and 10 type models as there
was for the original NANS food groups but that there is no further decrease for the 15
type model.
This suggests that less specific eating event types still align better with
participant defined labels but that using the structure of the NDNS RP food groups
improves the agreement between the more specific eating events and the participant
labels.
One explanation for this is that by grouping ‘tea,
coffee and water’ into one
food group it is only one vocabulary item in the eating event types it appears in and
hence there are a larger number of
top food groups that are more discriminatory.
This is in contrast to the eating event types discovered when the original NANS food
groups were used where there were a large number of eating event types dominated
by different proportions of combinations of tea, milk, bread, spreads and sugar, which
are not discriminatory.
7.3
Chapter summary
This chapter has shown that the resulting eating event types from applying topic
models to nutrition data from the NDNS RP dataset can be utilised for further
analysis.
This can occur at the individual
participant level,
the population sample
level
or for specific groups of interest.
In particular,
it has been demonstrated that
the content of eating events, in terms of the food groups consumed, and the subjective
label for the assigned most likely eating event type are well matched in the majority of
cases.
Patterns in the eating event types for an individual can be found and these can
be used in future work to investigate a person’s eating habits.
Moreover, it was shown
that the eating event types found can be utilised to investigate specific hypotheses,
using the example of how breakfast habits affect the eating events that occur for the
rest of the day in the sample population.
Inference can also be performed on different
groups within the dataset, based on a variable of interest, to reveal patterns that can
be used for further analysis.
An example was shown that highlighted the differences
between the probabilities of eating event types that occur on weekday and weekend
days.
175

Chapter summary
In addition to using the results from the NDNS RP dataset,
it has been demon-
strated that topic models can successfully be applied to other datasets containing
food diary data.
Food group combinations representative of eating event types were
found for the NDNS 2000 dataset and the NANS dataset.
These datasets both have
alternative sources of labels for eating event types:
a rule-based method for the NDNS
2000 dataset and participant defined labels in the NANS dataset.
Analysis was car-
ried out to investigate the number of
matches between the different label
sources.
The results demonstrated that the subjective labels assigned to eating event types
found by topic models matched the rule-based labels in up to 71% of cases and the
participant defined labels for up to 72% of eating events.
Some of the incorrect labels given to eating events by the results of the topic model
approach were identified to be linked to the choice of vocabulary.
Some food groups
are too ambiguous and contain a variety of food items that would be consumed during
different types of eating events, for example the NANS food group ‘biscuits including
crackers’.
Different coding strategies,
including how composite items are listed,
the
level of food groups and the use of average portions affect the resulting eating event
types discovered as they alter the underlying structure of the data.
Determining a
coding strategy for specific use with topic models for identifying eating event types
could help to improve the results.
Eating events with a small number of items, such as a cup of tea or coffee (some-
times listed as up to four items if split into coffee, water, milk and sugar), a piece of
fruit or a glass of juice are often assigned incorrect labels by both the topic model
results and the manual
rule based method.
Only considering the food groups for
these small
events does not provide enough information to reliably determine the
type of eating event.
However,
simply labelling all
events with one or two items as
drink/snack is not necessarily valid and still does not account for a cup of coffee with
four components.
One suggestion is to pre-process the data with rules based on more
detailed information, such as total energy content of eating event and then estimate
topic models using only data for eating events above a defined energy content.
Overall, the results have shown that using a model with a larger number of eating
event types aligns better with rule-based labels.
Conversely, models with fewer types
give a better match to participant defined labels.
This is because the larger the
number of
types,
the more specific the combinations of
food groups in each eating
event type is.
These results reflect the fact that subjective participant labels are more
varied in nature in comparison with applying a consistent set of
rules.
The choice
of
number of
eating events type to use should be based on the nutrition research
question being addressed.
176

Chapter summary
Exploring the eating events that were assigned different labels highlighted that
although sometimes each method can clearly give an incorrect result, often it is not
possible to decide which method is correct.
Many eating events could be given a
range of labels,
which could all
be considered correct but only depend on variables
such as time of day,
which do not directly change the nutrient content of the items
eaten.
For example, a cup of tea and a piece of toast could be eaten as breakfast, a
light meal or a snack.
In each instance, although the label is different, assuming the
quantities are the same, the nutritional content of the eating event is the same.
The benefit of the eating event types found using the topic model approach is that
they do not have to be labelled.
They are found based only on what is recorded in the
dataset and not biased by cultural
norms.
The resulting food group combinations
could be used for analysis without ever applying subjective labels to them.
For
example,
there is real
potential
for investigating routines and consistency in eating
habits.
A higher variability in eating event types may be indicative of chaotic eating
and hence lead to overconsumption and obesity.
Currently, nutrition researchers only
consider the standard deviation of energy intake in different time slots over multiple
days.
Using the food group combinations found by topic models would enable this
analysis to be extended to define similarity in both the energy intake and the food
sources of
the energy.
The drawback of
not labelling the eating event types is the
challenge of how to disseminate the results found in a format that will be suitable for
use in public policy creation and health initiatives.
In conclusion,
for the purpose of investigating how people actually combine food
groups together in eating events topic models are better than the rule-based approach.
This is because topic models are a data driven approach and is therefore less con-
strained than the rule-based approach which cannot account for the full variability in
the data.
Moreover, topic models do not rely on the use of predefined labels, which
can be biased by cultural
norms,
rather the focus is on the food groups involved.
However,
using topic models with only food groups as input has limitations.
More
detailed and useful information regarding the energy, weight and nutritional content
of an eating event is lost.
The approach is also affected by the choice of food groups
used, which is not standardised within the nutrition research community.

Conclusions and Outlook
This chapter highlights the conclusions of the research presented in this thesis and
how they address the stated research questions.
An outlook for how this research can
be extended through future work is also given.
8.1
Conclusions
The aim of the research conducted for this thesis was to detect behaviour patterns
in data collected by a residential
healthcare monitoring system in order to obtain
information of a greater quality than the raw sensor data.
To address this aim three
research questions were formulated that focus on specific challenges in this area.
This
section summarises the conclusions of the research related to each of these questions.
8.1.1
Detection of daily routines for healthcare monitoring
Can patterns in a person’s daily activities that
are representative of
routines be detected for a novel, real
world activity dataset?
Chapter 4 presented the development of a mobile phone logging application that
was used to collect a real
world dataset for two healthy volunteers with 16 days
of
activity data each.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to the daily
activities in this novel dataset and the results demonstrated that the detected groups
of activities are representative of routines.
An average accuracy of up to 80% was reported when comparing the discovered
routines with the recorded ground truth labels for each participant.
However for this
dataset, a higher accuracy was associated with a higher perplexity (across all numbers
178
8.1.
Conclusions
of routines), which suggests that the model does not generalise as well to unseen data.
This observation highlights the impact of the subjective nature of both ground truth
labelling and the assignment of labels to detected routines.
The semantic coherence
of
routines is as important,
if
not more,
than how well
they correspond to ground
truth labels.
In particular,
a discovered group of
activities may represent a valid
routine for a user that was not considered when labelling the dataset.
Considering the semantic coherence of the discovered routines resulted in the se-
lection of models with fewer routines than suggested by the quantitative measure of
the perplexity.
Using a larger number of routines gives a lower perplexity,
meaning
that the model can generalise to unseen data better, but this is because the discov-
ered routines are strongly associated with single activities rather than groups that
form a routine.
The duration of discovered routines must be long enough to include
a mixture of activities, in order for information of a greater quality than the input to
be obtained.
In addition,
it is recommended that the overall
duration of
the dataset used to
estimate the model
is of
sufficient length to represent the general
variability of
a
user’s behaviour, in order that the model is less sensitive to rare or unseen activities.
The absolute duration necessary will be dependent on the specific research question
and use case.
For example,
an elderly person with a very stable routine will need a
shorter dataset compared to a student with a chaotic routine.
Furthermore, datasets
should be collected over consecutive days to ensure there is no bias in the selection
of recording days.
In conclusion,
LDA can successfully be applied to a novel activity dataset to de-
tect patterns representative of routines.
The selection of the number of routines for
a model
can be guided by the measure of perplexity but the semantic coherence of
the routines in the context of the application must not be lost.
Validating detected
routines against ground truth labels can give a good indication of performance.
How-
ever, analysing the content of the routines directly can reveal more useful information
beyond the restriction of subjective predefined labels.
8.1.2
Identification of changes in routines over time
Can changes in the structure of daily routines over time be detected?
Following on from the results of chapter 4, that showed LDA can detect routines
in activity data,
the application of dynamic topic models (DTM) to detect changes
in the structure of
daily routines over time was considered in chapter 5.
The re-
sults demonstrated that changes over time in the probabilities of
activities within
179
8.1.
Conclusions
discovered routines can successfully be identified for a simulated dataset.
The results revealed that the relationship between the duration of the activities
used as input to the DTM and the number of routines in the model affect how easily
a change can be identified.
For the simulated dataset used in this research models
with 5 routines and only using activities that occur during waking hours (i.e.
no
sleep activities of
a duration greater than an hour) performed the best.
A novel
visualisation technique was developed that highlights activities that vary by at least
25% of the minimum probability of the activity occurring in the routine,
assuming
this is over 0.001.
These criteria were shown to be successful at identifying relevant
changes for the simulated dataset tested.
It was observed that not all of the changes in the simulated dataset were identified
at the activity level.
In other words, some changes were identified as a variation in the
frequency of a routine,
rather than the probability of an activity within routine(s).
This is due to the variation in duration of activities that are modelled in the simulated
dataset.
A limitation of using DTMs is that the model and dataset parameters need
to be tuned using expert knowledge and contextual information for different scenarios.
In conclusion, changes in the structure of daily routines over time can successfully
be detected using dynamic topic models for simulated datasets.
This preliminary
result suggests there is potential for this method to be successful when applied to real
activity data.
However, this approach is affected by the model and dataset parameters
and how they relate to each other and therefore these must be carefully selected for
each application.
Furthermore,
the criteria used to highlight relevant changes will
need to be adjusted to reflect significant real world healthcare criteria.
For example,
using a threshold of 0.001 for the minimum probability of activities considered to be
changing may not reflect any useful diagnostic information for clinicians.
8.1.3
Understanding how foods are combined in eating
events
Can the combinations of foods consumed together in different types of
eating events be automatically detected?
Chapter 6 presented a novel method for applying LDA to nutrition data recorded
in the form of
food diaries.
The results demonstrated that combinations of
food
groups that represent different types of eating events can automatically be detected
using LDA. This method was shown to successfully detect eating event types for three
different datasets in chapters 6 and 7.
180
8.1.
Conclusions
When visualising the results of
the eating event types found for the NDNS RP
dataset it was noted by a nutrition expert that some food groups often appeared with
a relatively large probability compared to others.
It was hypothesised that this was
due to the structure of the original dataset.
Chapter 6 detailed a sensitivity analysis,
revealing that altering the structure of
the data to eliminate this artefact did not
improve the performance of the topic models and hence the original structure should
be kept.
Chapter 7 showed that the eating event types detected for the NDNS RP dataset
can be utilised for further analysis.
Performing inference for single eating events
enables patterns in eating behaviours to be investigated at both the individual par-
ticipant and population sample levels.
Inference can also be performed on a group of
data related to a variable of interest to investigate similarities and differences between
the groups, such as weekdays and weekend days.
The subjective labels assigned to the eating event types discovered by LDA in the
NDNS 2000 and NANS datasets were validated using alternative sources of
labels.
The results given in chapter 7 revealed that the subjective labels matched the rule-
based labels in NDNS 2000 and participant defined labels in NANS for up to 71%
and 72% of
the eating events respectively.
Overall,
it was observed that a model
with a larger number of eating event types aligns better with rule-based labels and
conversely for participant defined labels.
This reflects the fact that there is more
variety in how participants assign labels to eating events.
Eating events with only one or two items are often assigned incorrect labels by both
the LDA and rule based approaches.
This is because only considering the food groups
for these small events does not provide enough information to reliably determine the
type of
eating event.
Only using food groups as input data for topic models is a
limitation of this method.
Data regarding the energy, weight and nutritional content
of an eating event,
that can reveal
important information,
is lost.
The approach is
also affected by the choice of food groups used, which is not standardised within the
nutrition research community.
In conclusion, combinations of foods consumed together in different types of eating
events can be automatically detected using LDA. The labels assigned to the discovered
combinations have a good agreement with other methods for labelling eating event
types.
However,
as all
types of
labelling are subjective in nature and biased by
cultural
norms it is proposed that the combinations of
food groups could be used
for further analysis without applying labels.
The drawback to this suggestion is the
challenge in disseminating the results to lay audiences in a useful manner.

Outlook
During the course of
this research several
avenues for future work were identified.
These are highlighted in this section with suggestions for extending the work pre-
sented in this thesis.
8.2.1
Future work for detecting routines and changes over
time
Analysing the results of applying LDA to the novel
activity dataset collected high-
lighted limitations of how the model deals with previously unseen data.
The recom-
mended guideline previously published by Seiter et al. [124] to use at least 14 days of
data for good performance was followed.
However, it was observed that over the 16
days of data for each participant in the novel
dataset some activities only occurred
on one or two days.
The performance of the model
decreased significantly for days
with these activities when a leave-one-day-out cross validation was performed.
It was
observed that the days with lower accuracies for participant two were weekend days,
whereas all the other days in the dataset were weekdays.
One improvement would be to collect data on consecutive days for a longer period
of
time and ensure that both weekend and weekdays are well
represented.
Future
work, in collaboration with clinical experts, should address the question of how much
data should be used to estimate a model that represents a baseline for establishing a
person’s ‘normal’ routine.
The amount of data required may vary depending on the
healthcare context and the nature of an individual’s lifestyle.
For example, a student
is likely to have a more chaotic routine than a parent with a small child or an older
person with a chronic disease.
Another possible solution for previously unseen data is to use online LDA with an
infinite vocabulary proposed by Zhai
and Boyd-Graber [211].
This method enables
the model
to expand topics to include additional
words by drawing topics from a
Dirichlet process (DP) with a base distribution over an infinite vocabulary,
instead
of
a finite Dirichlet distribution.
The infinite vocabulary is implemented using a
truncated ordered set that is updated to allow the vocabulary to dynamically expand
and contract as required.
As suggested in [211]
this model
could be combined with
the concept of dynamic topic models to model both how the topics and the underlying
dimensionality of the vocabulary changes.
This could be used to identify changes in
the variety of activities a person performs.
The results of applying dynamic topic models to activity data to identify changes
182
8.2.
Outlook
in the structure of
daily routines have limitations,
as discussed in section 5.4.
To
expand on this work the next step would be to run a larger experiment on more
complex simulated datasets with multiple parameters changing in any permutation.
This would demonstrate the ability of DTMs to detect changes in data that are more
similar to a real-world dataset.
If DTMs can successfully identify changes in a more
complex simulated dataset then they can be tested on real-world long term data with
known changes.
Furthermore,
valid criteria for detecting significant changes related
to health and well-being need to be established in collaboration with relevant experts.
Another important area of
research for applying DTMs to activity data is to
establish the optimal vocabulary and length of small time slices to discover changes
at the activity level.
These decisions should be made in conjunction with expert
clinical opinions in order to be able to identify changes that are significant in terms
of healthcare.
Different models may be required for different situations if changes are
occurring at varying levels of granularity.
In addition to DTMs there are several
other extensions to LDA,
as described in
section 2.3.2.
In particular, Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) could be applied
to activity data to discover routines without specifying the number in advance as this
is determined directly by the model.
HDP also offers the advantage of allowing new
topics or routines to be evoked by previously unseen data.
Therefore if new activities
occur that do not fit an existing routine, a new one can be defined.
This model can
then be further extended to create a model known as dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet
Processes that models how topic proportions change over time.
This could be used
to identify changes over time at a different level i.e.
the variation in the probability
of routines over time.
As well as overcoming the limitation of needing to define the number of routines
for LDA in advance,
Seiter et al.
[235]
propose an approach that addresses the
limitation of
time-invariant segments,
which include failure to handle transitions,
variations in activity duration, and short activities accurately.
This is a hierarchical
topic model approach that includes automatic segmentation of raw sensor data into
context words in an unsupervised way,
avoiding the need for annotations.
It allows
segments to vary in size by performing segmentation dynamically based on the data.
The hierarchical model uses a segmentation prior, that considers semantic and tem-
poral features of context words,
and distance dependent Chinese restaurant process
(ddCRP) to group segments and the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) to discover
activities.
Future work could build on this approach to address these limitations in
DTMs for discovering changes in routines over time.

Outlook
8.2.2
Future work for detecting eating event types
There is a clear opportunity to extend the work presented on detecting different
types of
eating events.
The discovered combinations of
food groups can be used,
with or without subjective labels,
as a basis for further analysis to address a wide
range of nutrition research questions.
For example, patterns in eating behaviours of
individuals can be explored further to determine if there are associations with specific
health and well being outcomes.
This could be applied to the data from the four and
seven day food diaries in the datasets utilised in this research or longer term data to
find more detailed patterns.
At a population level, characteristic patterns of specific groups, such as children,
could be investigated.
For example,
visualising the probability of
different eating
events over time might reveal that main meal type events are more likely between 5
and 7pm than for a group of adults aged 19 - 64.
The discovered eating event types
could also be linked back to other variables of interest recorded in the datasets.
For
example,
investigating correlations between a discovered eating event type and the
energy or nutrient content of the eating events for which this type is the most likely.
The effect of breakfast on the remaining eating event types throughout the rest
of the day was considered in section 7.1.1.2.
It was observed that people consuming
‘breakfast’
between 6 and 10am were more likely to have a second breakfast.
The
reason for this could be that the first event labelled as breakfast was just a cup of
tea or coffee and a more substantial
breakfast or second drink was consumed later.
Investigating this further by considering the energy of the eating events or removing
drink only events could reveal whether this hypothesis is correct.
The results highlighted that eating events containing all
of
the individual
items
for a homemade dessert e.g.
a cake,
are often assigned to an incorrect eating event
type.
This is because the food groups of the individual
items i.e.
eggs,
flour,
milk,
butter are different in nature to that for the final
product.
On the other hand,
for
some main meals e.g.
beef stew,
that are not split into their component parts,
the
incorrect label
is assigned due to the lack of detail.
Eating events with only one or
two items and drink only events are also often mislabelled.
An interesting avenue for
further work would be to investigate whether rule-based preprocessing of
the data
could resolve these limitations.
Various extensions to LDA could also be applied to nutrition data.
In particular,
HDP could be investigated so that the number of
eating events is automatically
determined by the model.
However,
this may not improve the results as the best
fit to the data and the semantic coherence of
the results do not always align.
A
184
8.2.
Outlook
variation on author topic models could also be considered as a solution for including
more information about eating events.
For example, the weight, energy and time of
the eating event, that were identified as key properties could be the equivalent of the
author of a document.
This means that the link between these variables and the food
groups are explicitly modelled.
However,
the original
author topic model
assumes
there is one author for a document containing multiple topics.
Therefore the model
would have to be modified to reflect the nature of the nutrition application.
