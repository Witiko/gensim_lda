Abstract.
Teachers have increasingly employed different methods to enrich the
learning of
a subject
in class,
drive other assignments,
and meet
curriculum
standards.
One of such methods is the use of movies as an alternative educa-
tional experience to support class discussions.
In this sense,
websites such as
TeachWithMovies
1
, arise as a valuable support to the creation of lesson plans.
In this website,
each movie is described as a lesson plan targeting the learn-
ing of a subject.
However,
the creation of such lesson plan or even a simple
educational description of the movie can demand much work and time,
since
the text describing the teaching plan must consider educational aspects of the
movie.
In this work, we propose BEATnIk (Biased Educational Automatic Text
summarIzation), which is an unsupervised algorithm to automatically generate
movies’ summaries.
Such algorithm favors educational
aspects from the text
to generate a biased educational summary.
The experiments conducted show
that our approach statistically outperforms a baseline in precision, recall, and
f-score.
1.
Introduction
The use of extracurricular learning material
is a common practice inside a classroom.
Teachers have been increasingly using movies, software and other kinds of learning ob-
jects that can support the teaching of the class subject, and some examples of such prac-
tices can be found in [Giraffa et al. 2015,
Oliveira et al. 2016,
Castro et al. 2016].
The
use of movies is one of the simplest ways to support teaching because it is easily avail-
able and is a time-controlled experience inside the classroom.
In this sense,
websites
such as TeachWithMovies
1
,
arise as a valuable support to the creation of lesson plans.
In this website,
a set of movies is described by teachers to be used as learning objects
inside a classroom.
Each movie description contains at
least
the movie’s benefits and
possible problems, a helpful background, a discussion; besides, with some descriptions,
there are also questions to be used in class.
The preparation of such type of material is
a time-consuming activity,
and we believe that an educational summary can help in the
elaboration of a longer movie-based lesson plan.
Several works address the challenge of extracting specific aspects from users’ re-
views to compose a summary about
a movie or a product.
Most
of those works rely

on supervised algorithms such as classification and regression [Xiong and Litman 2011,
Zeng and Wu 2013,
Yang et al. 2015].
However,
the quality of results produced by su-
pervised algorithms is dependent on the existence of a large, domain-dependent training
dataset.
In this sense, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods are an attractive alter-
native to avoid the labor-intense and error-prone task of manual annotation of training
datasets.
Considering such context
we describe,
in this paper,
BEATnIk (Biased Educa-
tional Automatic Text Summarization) an unsupervised algorithm to generate biased sum-
maries that cover educational aspects of movies from users’ reviews. By utilizing BEAT-
nIk we hope to help teachers in providing educational descriptions for movies.
So,
the
paper’s main contributions are: a) the description of a tool to assist teachers in the creation
of lesson plans from the movies’ reviews; and b) an unsupervised algorithm which outper-
forms the baseline, imitating the human educational description of the movie.
BEATnIk
can also be employed in other domains, it would only require small modifications to be
able to generate, for instance, a biased summary that covers the personal user’s aspect of
interest about products on Online Collaborative Reviews Websites. We would also like to
highlight that BEATnIk is open source and it is available on Internet
2
.
The rest
of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses the related
works.
Section 3 present the datasets employed on this work.
Section 4 present details
of BEATnIk algorithm.
Section 5 describes the design of our experiments, and Section 6
discusses the achieved results. Section 7 summarizes our conclusions and presents future
research directions.

techniques
have
been
successfully
em-
ployed
on
user-content
to
highlight
the
most
relevant
information
among
the
documents
[Erkan and Radev 2004,
Radev et al. 2004,
Ganesan et al. 2010,
Saggion and Poibeau 2013,
Ramos et al. 2017].
Regarding the techniques employed,
several
works have explored unsupervised methods based on graph centrality.
For
instance MRR [Woloszyn et al. 2017],
that
combines the centrality scores and human
explicit
feedbacks
to produce a ranking of
relevant
documents.
Other
example is
presented by [Wu et al. 2011] that combines the centrality scores of each sentences with
the documents’ length to produce an overall centrality score for each review.
However,
this method does not scale well due the chosen centrality granularity, which implies dual
use of PageRank,
and requires pre-processing to identify specific textual features (e.g.
nouns, adjectives).
There are also studies using supervised learning strategies to predict
the text
relevance [Xiong and Litman 2011,
Zeng and Wu 2013,
Yang et al. 2015].
Addition-
ally,
the use of regression algorithms consistently improves the prediction of helpful-
ness [Wan 2013].
However,
a common drawback of supervised learning approaches is
that
the quality of results is heavily influenced by the availability of a large,
domain-
dependent annotated corpus to train the model.
Unsupervised learning techniques are at-
tractive because they do not imply the cost of corpus annotation either training. Therefore,
it is described in this paper an unsupervised biased algorithm to extract educational as-
pects from movies’ reviews with the goal to assist teachers on the task of creating movie-
based lesson plans.

Datasets Employed
As the goal of our approach was to build a biased summarizer for educational purposes,
we used two datasets to perform the experiments.
The first served as a word thesaurus
to implement
the educational
bias,
and it
was collected from an educational
website
3
TeachWithMovies (TWM) where a set of movies are described by teachers with the goal
to use them as learning objects inside a classroom. The second dataset is Amazon Movie
Reviews (AMR) [McAuley and Leskovec 2013] which provides user comments about a
large set of movies.
Since we were interested in movies that appeared in both datasets, a
filter was applied, and we ended up with 256 movies to perform our evaluation. Next, we
describe with more details each dataset.
3.1.
Teaching with Movies
The TeachWithMovies dataset was collected through a crawler developed by us. Different
teachers described the movies on the website, but each movie has only one description,
this was a challenge while collecting the data because the information was not standard-
ized or had associated metadata.
However,
we have noticed that some movies presented common information:
i)
movie description;
ii) rationale for using the movie;
iii) movie benefits for teaching a
subject; iv) movie problems and warnings for young watchers; and v) objectives of using
this movie in class. The developed crawler extracted such information, and we have used
the movie description since it
contains the greatest
amount
of educational
aspects.
In
the end, 408 unique movies and video clips were extracted, but after matching with the
Amazon dataset, we could use 256 movies.
3.2.
Amazon Movie Reviews
The Amazon Movie Reviews was collected with a timespan of more than ten years and
consists of proximately 8 millions of reviews that include product and user information,
ratings, and a plain text review.In Table 1 is shown some statistics about the data.

BEATnIk Algorithm
In BEATnIk, a complete graph is constructed for each movie. In this graph, each sentence
extracted from the Amazon’s dataset becomes a node, and each edge’s weight is defined
by a similarity measure applied between sentences.
An adapted cosine equation assesses
the similarity.
The algorithm then employs PageRank [Page et al. 1999] to compute the
centrality of each node. The intuition behind this approach is that central sentences high-
light aspects frequently mentioned in a text. Also, BEATnIk takes into account keywords
3

1379
Anais do XXVIII Simpósio Brasileiro de Informática na Educação (SBIE 2017)
VI Congresso Brasileiro de Informática na Educação (CBIE 2017)
extracted from the lesson plans of TWM (used as a bias) to compute the importance of
each sentence.
The final
educational
summary is based on the centrality score of the
sentences weighted by the presence of educational keywords.
Let
S
be a set of all sentences extracted from the
R
user’s reviews about a single
movie,
BEATnIk builds a graph representation
G = (V, E)
,
where
V = S
and
E
is a
set
of edges that
connect
pairs
hu, vi
∈ V
.
The score of each node (that
represent
a
sentence) is given by the harmonic mean between its centrality score on the graph given
by PageRank, and the sum of the frequencies of its education keywords (stated in equation
2).
The pseudo-code of BEATnIk is displayed in Algorithm 1, where
G
is represented as
the adjacency matrix

The main steps of the BEATnIk algorithm are:
(a) it
builds a similarity graph
(
W
) between pairs of reviews of the same product (lines:
1-3); (b) the graph is pruned
(W’) by removing all edges that do not meet a minimum similarity threshold,
given by
the parameter
β
4
(lines 4-10); (c) using PageRank, the centrality scores of each node is
calculated (line 11); (d) using the educational corpora, each sentence is scored according
the presence of educational keywords (line 13);
(e) The final importance score of each
node is given by the harmonic mean between its centrality score on the graph,
and the
sum of its education keywords frequencies (line 14).
To get the similarity between the two nodes we define an adapted metric, that is the
cosine difference between two corresponding sentence vectors [Erkan and Radev 2004]:

We
employed the approach described by [Mihalcea and Tarau 2004] to extract the keywords
from the educational corpora.
The similarity between the sentences and the keywords
extracted from the TWM lesson plans are given by the following equation:

(2)
The comparison of our approach to TextRank [Mihalcea and Tarau 2004], which
is also a Graph-based Automatic Text Summarization, revealed that BEATnIk generates
summaries closer to the educational description of the movies in TWM (details are pre-
sented in the next section).

Experiment Design
This section presents the experimental
setting used to evaluate BEATnIk.
It
describes
the method employed as the baseline for comparison,
the educational plans adopted as
Gold-standard and the metric applied for evaluation, as well as details of the experiment,
performed to assess BEATnIk.
5.1.
The baseline
The
results
obtained
from our
proposed
approach
are
compared
with
Tex-
trank [Mihalcea and Tarau 2004]
algorithm.
Textrank was chosen because it
is also
a graph-based ranking algorithm and has been widely employed in Natural
Language
tools [
ˇ
Reh
˚
u
ˇ
rek and Sojka 2010].
Textrank essentially decides the importance of a sentence based on the idea of
“voting” or “recommending”.
Considering that in this approach each edge represents a
1381
Anais do XXVIII Simpósio Brasileiro de Informática na Educação (SBIE 2017)
VI Congresso Brasileiro de Informática na Educação (CBIE 2017)
vote,
the higher the number of votes that are cast for a node,
the higher the importance
of the node (or sentence) in the graph.
The most important sentences compose the final
summary.
5.2.
Gold-Standard
The lesson plans found on the TWM website were used as a gold-standard to assess
BEATnIk summaries.
An English-speaking teacher describes each lesson plan and takes
into consideration the educational aspects of the movie.
The lessons are categorized by movie genre,
learning discipline,
recommended
age (from 3 years-old to college level),
and alphabetical order.
Inside the lesson plans,
there is also some learning goals regarding the movie,
such as the learning subject,
the
social-emotional learning, and the ethical emphasis.
Taking,
for instance,
the summary of “Into the Wild” lesson plan presented in
Figure 1,
we can observe in the “Description” section that
the teacher has focused on
discussing learning the importance of human relationships.
At the top right,
it is found
the structure of the whole lesson available online
5
.
In the remaining of the lesson,
the
teacher still presents some benefits of the movie,
such as risky behavior can have fatal
consequences and relationships with people are an essential part of life.
TWM provided a well-described educational dataset, and despite the lack of stan-
dardization of lessons plans,
we could use it successfully as a gold-standard to perform
our experiments.
5.3.
Evaluation Metric
The evaluation was performed by applying ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for
Gisting Evaluation) [Lin 2004],
which is a metric inspired on the Bilingual Evaluation
Understudy (BLEU) [Saggion and Poibeau 2013].
Specifically, we used ROUGE-N in the evaluation, this version of ROUGE makes
a comparison of n-grams between the summary to be evaluated and the “gold-standard”;
in our case,
BEATnIk summaries and TWM lesson plans,
respectively.
We evaluated
the first 100 words of the summaries obtained by our approach and the baseline since
it corresponds to the median size of the gold-standard.
ROUGE was chosen because it
is one of most used measures in the fields of Machine Translation and Automatic Text
Summarization [Poibeau et al. 2012].
5.4.
BEATnIk’s bias
The set of lesson plans extracted from TMW was used as an educational bias for BEATnIk
algorithm.
When generating a biased summary for a specific movie, BEATnIk does not
take in consideration such movie lesson plan.
Instead,
it builds a graph using all other
movies information,
excepting the movie to be summarized.
This strategy avoids any
positive influence on the performance of the predictive model.
The retrieved corpus was composed of 991 sentences and 2,811 unique tokens. In
Table 2 we describe the first 20 keywords extracted from TWM corpus.

Results
In this section,
we present BEATnIk’s evaluation regarding the adopted baselines con-
cerning precision, recall, and f-Score obtained by using ROUGE-N.
The gold-standard utilized in the experiments,
as already stated in Section 5,
is
the educational description extracted from the TWM website.
Table 3 shows the mean
Precision, Recall, and F-Score, considering both BeatnIk and Textrank (the gold-standard
used as the baseline).
The results presented in Table 3 show that BEATnIk outperformed the baseline in
all measurements carried out. Regarding Precision, the differences range from 4.9 to 11.9
percentage points (pp) on all ROUGE-N analyzed, where N is the size of the n-gram used
by ROUGE. Using Wilcoxon statistical test with a significance level of 0.05, we verified
that BEATnIk is statistically superior when compared to the baseline.
Regarding recall,
the differences are also in favor of BEATnIk, ranging from 4.7 to 11.5 pp when compared
to the baseline.

To illustrate the differences between the BEATnIk and a generic text summarizer
on the task of extracting the educational aspects from the movie’s reviews, consider the
snippet of summaries about the movie ’Conrack’ at table 4. In this example, while BEAT-
nIk highlights the educational aspects such as method lesson, teaching, and children, the
generic text summarizer used as baseline highlights the aspects frequent mentioned in the
reviews, such as related to the screenplay and the director.

Conclusion
In this paper,
we presented BEATnIk,
an algorithm for the identification of relevant re-
views based on the concept
of node centrality.
The intuition behind BEATnIk is that
central sentences extracted from users’ movies reviews are closer to a human-made educa-
tional description of the movie if such central sentences contain “educational keywords”.
We proved this assumption and showed that BEATnIk achieved statistically superior re-
sults than Textrank (a general summary algorithm).

The main contributions of this paper are: a) the design and presentation of BEAT-
nIk, a tool to assist teachers in the creation of lesson plans based on movies’ reviews; and
b) the methodology of experiments designed to assess BEATnIk, which outperformed the
baseline, imitating the human educational description of the movies.
Finally,
it is also important to state that we found out a considerable number of
highly helpful sentences with low centrality indexes which lead us to consider the inves-
tigation of other techniques to select the most relevant sentences to compose the movies’
educational
description.
In particular,
the Segmented Bushy Path which is widely ex-
plored in text summarization performs a segmentation of the graph in portions that corre-
spond to the topics of the text.
Such segmentation may allow other relevant sentences to
be considered in the output summary.
