Abstract
We describe our system for participating
in SemEval-2017 Task 3 on Community
Question Answering.
Our approach relies
on combining a rich set
of various types
of features:
semantic and metadata.
The
most important types turned out to be the
metadata feature and the semantic vectors
trained on QatarLiving data.
In the main
Subtask C,
our
primary submission was
ranked fourth,
with a MAP of 13.48 and
accuracy of 97.08.
In Subtask A, our pri-
mary submission get into the top 50%.

Introduction
SemEval-2017 Task 3 on Community Question
Answering
(Nakov et al.,
2017) aims to solve a
real-life application problem.
The main subtask
C (Question-External
Comment
Similarity) asks
to find an answer in the forum that is appropriate
as a response to a newly posted question.
This is
achieved by retrieving similar questions and rank-
ing their answers with respect to the new question.
Three additional supporting subtasks are defined:
Subtask A (Question-Comment Similarity):
Given a question from a question-comment thread,
rank the comments within the thread based on
their relevance with respect to the question.
The
comments in a question-comment thread are anno-
tated as Good, PotentiallyUseful and Bad. A good
ranking is the one that ranks all Good comments
above PotentiallyUseful and Bad ones.
Subtask B (Question-Question Similarity):
Given a new question,
re-rank the similar ques-
tions retrieved by a search engine with respect to
that
question.
The potentially relevant
question-
s are annotated as PerfectMatch, Relevant and Ir-
relevant
with respect to the original question.
A
good ranking is the one that the PerfectMatch and
the Relevant questions are both ranked above the
Irrelevant ones.
Subtask
C (Question-External
Comment
Similarity): Given a new question and the set of
the first 10 related questions (retrieved by a search
engine), each associated with its first 10 comments
appearing in its thread. Re-rank the 100 comments
(10 questions
×
10 comments) according to their
relevance with respect to the original question.

Related Work
This year’s SemEval-2017 Task3 is a follow up of
SemEval-2016 Task3 (Nakov et al., 2016) on An-
swer Reranking in Community Question Answer-
ing. There are three reranking subtasks associated
with the English dataset.
Subtask A is the same
as subtask A at SemEval-2015 Task 3 (Joty et al.,
2015), but with slightly different annotation and a
different evaluation measure.
The research of rerank can be classified into t-
wo categories, traditional feature engineering and
newest deep neural network employing.
The first
type of method pays more attention on textural
features exploiting.
Textual
features have been
exploited well, including lexical features (e.g., n-
grams), syntactic features (such as parse trees) and
semantic features
(for
instance wordnet-based).
Some work exploit various feature extraction ap-
proaches and indicates the importance of feature
selection in the rerank task.
(Filice et al.,
2016;
Franco-Salvador
et
al.,
2016;
Mihaylova et
al.,
2016).
However those methods all face the prob-
lem of feature merging, due to many features may
affect each other.
Most recently, convolution neural networks (C-
NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are em-
ployed in the task of text
rerank
(Wu and Lan,
2016; Qiu and Huang, 2015).
Wu’s team use both
convolutional
neural
network and long-short
ter-
292
m memory network (Wu and Lan, 2016) to train
the model.
Qiu’s model
(Qiu and Huang,
2015)
integrates sentence modeling and semantic match-
ing into a single model,
which can not only cap-
ture the useful information with convolutional and
pooling layers, but also learn the matching metric-
s between the question and its answer.
However,
these methods all
face the problem of too many
parameters in the model and it is hard to choose
the best parameters.
We build our system on top of the framework
developed by (Mihaylov and Nakov, 2016). In ad-
dition, we extract more different kinds of features.
In order to solve the problem of feature merging,
we just try different combinations of features and
choose the best one in the development set.

Data
There are 6,398 questons and 40,288 comments
for subtask A, 317 original + 3,169 related ques-
tions for subtask B, and 317 original questions +
3,169 related questions + 31,690 comments for
subtask C (Nakov et al., 2016).
We also used semantic vectors pretrained on
Qatar
Living Forum:
200 dimensional
vectors,
available for 472,100 words and phrases.
4
Method
In particular,
we formulate all
the three tasks as
classification problems.
We use various of
features like question and
comment
metadata;
distance measures between
the question and the comment;
lexical semantics
vectors for the question and for the comment.
4.1
Features
We use several
semantic vector
similarity and
metadata feature groups.
For the similarity mea-
sures mentioned below,
we use cosine similarity
(Nguyen and Bai, 2010):
1 −
a.b
kak.kbk
(1)
Semantic Word Embeddings.
We use semantic
word embeddings obtained from Word2Vec mod-
els trained on different unannotated data sources
including the QatarLiving and DohaNews (Abbar
et al., 2016).
For each piece of text such as com-
ment text, question body and question subject, we
construct the centroid vector from the vectors of
all words in that text.
centroid(w
1..n
) =
P
n
i=1
w
i
n
(2)
4.1.1
Semantic Features
We use various similarity features calculated using
the centroid word vectors on the question body, on
the question subject and on the comment text,
as
well as on parts thereof:
Question to Answer similarity. We assume that
a relevant
answer should have a centroid vector
that is close to that for the question
(Min et al.,
2017).
We use the question body to comment tex-
t similarity, and question subject to comment text
similarity.
Maximized similarity.
We rank each word in
the answer text to the question body centroid vec-
tor according to their similarity and we take the
max similarity of the top N words
(Fu and Mura-
ta, 2016). We take the top 1,2 and 3 similarities as
features.
The assumption here is that if the aver-
age similarity for the top N most similar words is
high, then the answer might be relevant.
Aligned similarity.
For each word in the ques-
tion body, we choose the most similar word from
the comment text and we take the average of all
best word pair similarities as suggested in
(Tran
et al., 2015)
Dependency syntax tree based word vector
similarities. We obtain the dependency syntax tree
with the Stanford parser
(De Marneffe and Man-
ning, 2008), and we take similarities between cen-
troid vectors of noun phrases from the comment
text
and the centroid vector of the noun phrases
from the question body text.
The assumption is
that same parts of dependency syntax tree between
the question and the comment might be closer than
other parts of dependency tree.
Word clusters (WC) similarity.
We cluster the
word vectors from the Word2Vec vocabulary in-
to 500 clusters (with 400 words per
cluster
on
average) using K-Means clustering
(Basu et al.,
2002). We then calculate the cluster similarity be-
tween the question body word clusters and the an-
swer text word clusters.
For all experiments,
we
use clusters obtained from the Word2Vec model
trained on QatarLiving forums with vector size of
100,
window size 10,
minimum words frequency
of 5, and skip-gram 1.
LDA topic similarity.
We perform topic clus-
tering using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as
implemented in the gensim toolkit
(Rehurek and
293
Sojka, 2010)on Train1+Train2 questions and com-
ments. We build topic models with 150 topics. For
each question body and comment text, we get the
corresponding distribution, and calculated similar-
ity. The assumption here is that if the question and
the comment share similar topics,
they are more
likely to be relevant to each other.
Semantic features above can fully represent the
similarity between the question and the comment,
which is very important in the next classification
part.
4.1.2
Metadata-based Features
Metadata-based features provide clues about
the
social aspects of the community (Kıcıman, 2010).
Thus,
except
for the semantic features described
above, we also used some common sense metadata
features:
Answer containing a question mark.
We think
if the comment has a question mark, it may be an-
other question, which might indicate a bad answer
(Katzman et al., 2017).
The presence and the number of links in the
question and in the comment.
We count both in-
bound and outbound links.
Our hypothesis is that
the presence of a reference to another resource is
indicative of a relevant comment
(Newton et al.,
2017).
Answer length.
The assumption here is that
longer
answers
could bring more useful
detail
(Yang et al., 2017).
Question length.
If the question is longer,
it
may be more clear,
which may help users give a
more relevant answer
(Figueroa, 2017).
Question to comment length.
If the question is
long and the answer is short,
it may be less rele-
vant.
The comment
is written by the author of the
question If the answer is posted by the same user
who posted the question and it is relevant, why has
he/she asked the question in the first place?
Answer rank in the thread.
Earlier answers
could be posted by users who visit the forum more
often, and they may have read more similar ques-
tions and answers. Moreover, discussion in the fo-
rum tends to diverge from the question over time.
4.1.3
Other-extra Features
Some features neither belong to the semantic nor
metadata-based features,
we call
them extra fea-
tures. They are also useful in the task of rerank.
Special
symbols.
We think whether the com-
ment
text
contains smiley,
e-mails,
phone num-
bers, only laughter, ”thank you” phrases, personal
opinions, or disagreement is an important feature
(Toba et al., 2014).
Numbers of special part of speech We extract
statistics about the number of verbs,
nouns,
pro-
nouns,
and adjectives in the question and in the
comment, as well as the number of numbers.
Numbers of
misspelled words We obtain the
features relate to spelling and include number of
misspelled words that
are within edit
distance 2
from a word in our vocabulary and number of of-
fensive words from a predefined list
(Agichtein
et al., 2008).
4.2
Classifier
For each Question and Comment
pair,
we first-
ly extract
the features described above from the
Question body and the comment
text.
Then we
concatenate the extracted features in a bag of fea-
tures vector and have them normalized.
After the
normalization,
the value are mapped to interval
[-1,1].
At
last,
we input
them into the classifi-
er.
In our experiments,
we use L2-regularized l-
ogistic regression classifier
(Buitinck et al., 2013)
and SVM classifier
(Zweigenbaum and Lavergne,
2016)
respectively.
For
the logistic regression
classifier, we tune the classifier with different val-
ues of the C (cost) parameter
(Aono et al., 2016),
and we take the one that yield the best accuracy on
10-fold cross-validation on the training set.
For
the SVM classifier,
we choose different
kernels
(Moreno et al., 2003) and achieve the best results
with RBF kernel.
We only show the better result-
s of above two classifiers in the next section.
We
use binary classification Good vs.
Bad (including
both Bad and Potentially Useful original labels).
The output of the evaluation for each test example
is a label, either Good or Bad, and the probability
of being Good in the 0 to 1 range.
We then use
this output probability as a relevance rank for each
Comment in the Question thread.

Experiments and Evalution
This
section
presents
the
evaluation
of
the
SemEval-2017 Task 3 on CQA (Nakov et
al.,
2017).
Note that for our system EICA we did not
use data from SemEval-2015 CQA. The best result
of each partition and subtask is highlighted.
Our
percentage comparisons all use absolute values.

SemEval-2016 Task 3 Results
We can see the results of Subtask A (question-
comment similarity ranking) in Table 1.
In terms
of ranking measures, our system outperform both
the random and the search engine baseline.
We
observe a MAP improvement of 18.15% compare
with the results obtained by the search engine. We
obtain the second rank in SemEval-2016 (Nakov
et al., 2016).
Similar to Subtask A ,the performance of our
approach is also superior in Subtask B (question-
question similarity ranking).
As we can see in Ta-
ble 3, using the test set for 2016, the improvement
of MAP and AvgRec has been of 1.59%, 2.37% re-
spectively compare to the search engine baseline.
In this case, the improvements in performance are
slightly reduced.
We obtain the second rank in
SemEval-2016 (Nakov et al., 2016).
For Subtask C,
the results are shown in Table
5.
Using the test
set
for 2016,
the improvement
of MAP and AvgRec has been of 8.21%,
0.93%
respectively compare to the search engine baseline
(Nakov et al., 2016).
5.2
SemEval-2017 Task 3 Results
We can see the results of Subtask A (question-
comment similarity ranking) in Table 2.
In terms
of ranking measures,
our system also outperform
both the random and the search engine baseline.
Using the test set for 2017 (Nakov et al., 2017),
we observe a MAP improvement of 13.92% com-
pare with the results obtained by the search engine.
Similar to Subtask A ,the performance of our
approach is also superior in Subtask B (question-
related question similarity ranking).
As shown in
Table 4, using the test set for 2017 (Nakov et al.,
2017), we obtain the MAP of 41.11% and AvgRec
of 77.45.
For Subtask C, we can see the results in Table
6. Using the test set for 2017 (Nakov et al., 2017),
the improvement
of MAP and AvgRec is 4.3%,
2.72% respectively compare to the search engine
baseline.
The results
in both SemEval-2016
(Nakov
et
al.,
2016) and SemEval-2017
(Nakov et
al.,
2017) prove that
features we use are quite use-
ful
for ranking comments with respect
to a giv-
en question (Subtask A and C),
but
they do not
achieve as similar results when ranking questions
with respect to other questions(Subtask B).

Conclusion
We have described our system for SemEval-2017,
Task 3 on Community Question Answering.
Our
296
approach rely on semantic and metadata-based
features.
In the main Subtask C, our primary sub-
mission is ranked fourth, with a MAP of 13.48 and
accuracy of 97.08, which is the highest. In Subtask
A, our primary submission is sixth, with MAP of
86.53 and accuracy of 61.64.
In future work, we plan to use our best feature
combinations in a deep learning architecture, as in
the Qiu’s system (Qiu and Huang,
2015),
which
outperforms the other methods on two matching
tasks.
We also want to use information from en-
tire threads
(Joty et al., 2015) to make better pre-
dictions.
How to combine them efficiently in the
system is an interesting research question.
