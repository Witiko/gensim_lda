Abstract
Retweeting is the core mechanism of informa-
tion diffusion on Twitter, few studies have investigated the
subjective motivation of a user to retweet a message. In this
paper,
in light
of psychological
theory,
we assume that
a
tweet is more likely to be retweeted by a user because of
similar
subjectivity and propose a subjectivity model
to
combine both the topics and opinions to model subjectivity.
With state-of-the-art
topic model
and sentiment
analysis
techniques,
we
establish subjectivity model
by finding
topics and determining opinions toward these topics from
user-generated content
simultaneously.
We evaluate our
model
in the retweeting analysis
problem to verify its
impact
on retweeting and effectiveness in the retweeting
prediction performance.

Introduction
Twitter is well-known for its freedom of publishing short
messages (i.e.,
tweets),
and viral spreading of information
across complex social networks. In addition to large amounts
of user-generated content (UGC), Twitter provides its social
network
functions
for
connection,
communication
and
information diffusion by allowing users to message one
another directly and follow one another publicly. The com-
plex networks and large content volume of Twitter provide
researchers with insights into people’s social behaviors on a
scale that has never been possible [37].
Information diffusion is a challenging problem which
might
be
investigated
on
Twitter,
because
retweeting
convention and complex networks
of
Twitter
have pro-
vided an unprecedented mechanism for
the
spread of
information despite the restricted length of
tweets
[20].
Actually, almost 25 % of the tweets published by users are
retweeted from others [45].
Therefore,
it
is important
to
understand how retweeting behavior works so as to help
study information diffusion on Twitter.
Although several works have concentrated on analyzing
retweeting habits and influencing factors [4,
22,
38],
most
of them are generic, not user-oriented. From the point of a
user,
retweeting is
a process
that
includes
reading the
tweet, estimating the content and deciding to share, and the
crucial
part
of the process is to estimate whether a tweet
contains information interesting to the user who might find
it
worth sharing.
Therefore,
in this study,
we focus spe-
cifically on analyzing the retweeting behavior from the user
modeling perspective.
Previous studies on retweeting analysis have shown that
an enriched user
model
gives
coherent
and consistent
explanation for retweeting motivation[1,
13,
24].
Specifi-
cally,
users have been modeled from four types of infor-
mation:
profile
features
(‘‘Who
you
are’’),
tweeting
behavior
(‘‘How you tweet’’),
linguistic content
(‘‘What
you tweet’’) and social
network (‘‘Who you tweet’’) [30].
Although demographic profile,
tweeting habits
and net-
work structure might
determine the source and scope of
information users could be exposed to,
topics of interest

encapsulated in rich linguistic content
have been proved
consistently dependable for retweeting behavior explana-
tion.
For
example,
whether
a tweet
will
be propagated
largely depends on its identification with the interests of
users [16,
31].
However,
beyond merely publishing news
and events, Twitter has become a platform where different
opinions are presented and exchanged by allowing users to
publish subjective messages on topics they are interested
in.
It
is
demonstrated that
UGC with rich sentimental
information can trigger
more attention,
feedback or
par-
ticipation [37],
and tweets with high emotional
diversity
has a better chance of being retweeted [32]. Until recently,
most efforts have been trying to find out whether and how
sentiment of a tweet will influence its spreading,
but none
has realized that
although users receive a great
many of
tweets on different topics every day,
whether a tweet will
be retweeted depends on the subjective choice of users.
Subjective initiative nature of human determines that his
behavior pattern is subjectivity driven.
Psychologist
have
identified subjectivity as the underlying factor that
influ-
ences taking what
behaviors to process incoming stimul
[26].
According to the
theory of
Biased Assimilation,
people
are
prone
to
choose
and
diffuse
information
according to their own biased subjectivity [19, 39]. In this
study,
we explore the UGC on Twitter to model
the sub-
jectivity of users and investigate whether the subjectivity
model
could
benefit
the
retweeting
behavior
analysis.
Intuitively,
subjectivity can be represented as topics and
opinions articulated in the information generated by users
on Twitter. We use the state-of-the-art topic model to find
the topics users are talking about,
and sentiment
analysis
techniques to determine user’s opinions toward these topics
from UGC simultaneously.
We evaluate our model on the
retweeting analysis problem to verify its impact
on ret-
weeting behavior.
Modeling subjectivity on Twitter is a challenging task
because of
the sparsity of
textual
information and the
dynamic of
topics and opinions.
However,
we are inter-
ested in understanding retweeting behavior at a local level
rather than at a global level, since most of time retweeting
pertains to a local network consisting of the tweet publisher
and followers. The relatively tiny size and topic homophily
of local network degrade the impact of sparsity. Given the
biased nature of subjectivity,
while new information may
arise
and old information may change
their
meaning,
biased subjectivity is likely to be more consistent and less
prone
to
external
perturbations;
therefore,
subjectivity
model of a user is less likely to be influenced by changes of
topics and opinions on Twitter.
Our work aims to define and establish the subjectivity
model
and to identify the role of subjectivity in the pro-
cesses of information diffusion on Twitter.
Our contribu-
tions can be summarized as follows:
•
In light of psychological theory, we firstly put forward a
formal
definition of
subjectivity model
which model
both the topics and opinions simultaneously.
•
Based on the state-of-the-art topic model and sentiment
analysis techniques,
we build subjectivity model
from
UGC on Twitter and apply it to the retweeting behavior
analysis problem.
•
We systematically evaluate the effectiveness
of
the
subjectivity model
in a series
of
experiments.
It
is
demonstrated that
our model
outperforms other UGC-
based models in retweeting prediction and gives the
most
significant
improvement
over
an off-the-shelf
predicting model.

model

Retweeting Analysis
A lot
of works have analyzed the characteristics of ret-
weeting,
examining factors that
lead to increased retwee-
tability and designing models to estimate the probability of
being retweeted.
As for factors influencing retweetability,
Suh et al.
[38] found that tweets with URLs and hashtags
were
more
likely
to
be
retweeted.
Macskassy
and
Michelson [24]
found that
models
derived from tweet
content
could explain most
of
retweeting behaviors.
Co-
marela et al.
[11] found previous response to the tweeter,
the tweeters sending rate, the freshness of information, the
length of tweet could affect followers response to retweet.
Starbird and Palen [35]
found that
tweets
with topical
keywords were more likely to be retweeted. There are also
many works
extending the analysis
to build retweeting
prediction model.
Osborne and Lavrenko [31] introduced
features such as novelty of a tweet and the number of times
the
author
is
listed
to train
a
model
with a
passive
aggressive algorithm and found that tweet features added a
substantial
boost
to the performance.
Jenders et
al.
[20]
analyzed the ‘‘obvious’’ and ‘‘latent’’ features from struc-
tural,
content-based,
and sentimental
aspects and found a
combination of features covering all aspects was the key to
high prediction quality.
Naveed et
al.
[27,
28] introduced
interestingness based on such features as sentiments and
topics to predict the probability of retweeting for an indi-
vidual
tweet.
Feng and Wang [13]
proposed a feature-
aware factorization model to rerank the tweets according to
their
probability of
being retweeted.
Pfitzner
et
al.
[32]
proposed a new measure called emotional divergence and
Cogn Comput (2015) 7:198–210

showed that
high emotional
diverse tweets
have higher
chances of being retweeted.
All
works introduced above have tried to answer
the
question of ‘‘whether and why a tweet will be retweeted by
anyone,’’ but they are weak to capture ‘‘whether a tweet is
retweetable from a user-centric perspective considering the
interests and opinions.’’ In this paper, we will try to answer
this question by building a subjectivity model
which can
capture both the interests and opinions of users.
User Modelling
With the
popularity of
social
media,
researchers
have
begun
to
pay
close
attention
to
model
users
on
the
massive
amount
of
UGC.
These
studies
provide
researchers
with
insights
into
user
online
behaviors.
Hannon et

proposed that
Twitter
users
can be
modeled by tweets
content
and the relation of

social
network.

discov-
ered user’s interests by leveraging Wikipedia as external
knowledge

[44] proposed a mixture
model
which
incorporated
three
important
factors,
namely breaking news,

the
value of in-depth features by exploiting the UGC,
which
reflect a deeper understanding of the Twitter user and the
user
network structure.
Few works have identified the correlation between the
opinions of
users and their
behaviors,
motivated by the
observation, we put forward subjectivity model to combine
both interests and opinions to model a user.
Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a popular research area and previous
researches have mainly focused on reviews or news com-
ments
and approaches
can be grouped into three main
categories: keyword spotting, lexical affinity, and statistical
methods [7].
However,
Erik Cambria et
al.
[6] developed
SenticNet
3,
a publicly available semantic and affective
resource for
concept-level
sentiment
analysis by making
use of ‘‘energy flows’’ to connect various parts of extended
common and commonsense knowledge representations to
one another.
Recently,
researchers began to pay more and
more attention to social
media such as Twitter.
Hu et
al.
[17] interpreted emotional
signals available in tweets for
unsupervised sentiment analysis by providing a unified way
to model
two main categories of emotional
signals:
emo-
tion indication and emotion correlation.
Jiang et
al.
[21]
focused on target-dependent
Twitter sentiment
classifica-
tion and proposed a method to improve performance by
taking target-dependent
features
and related tweets
into
consideration.
Asiaee et al.
[2] presented a cascaded clas-
sifier
framework
for
per-tweet
sentiment
analysis
by
extracting tweets about a desired target subject, separating
tweets
with sentiment,
and setting apart
positive
from
negative tweets.
Hu emph et
al.
[18] extracted sentiment
relations
between tweets
based on social
theories
and
proposed a novel sociological approach to utilize sentiment
relations between messages to facilitate sentiment
classi-
fication.
Motivated by sociological
theories that
humans
tend to have consistently biased opinions,
Calais Guerra
et
al.
[5]
addressed challenges
of
topic-based real-time
sentiment
analysis by proposing a novel
transfer learning
approach with a suitable source task of opinion holder bias
prediction. Thelwall et al. [40, 41] designed SentiStrength,
an algorithm for extracting sentiment strength from infor-
mal
English text
by exploiting the grammar and spelling
styles in typical social media text.
In this paper,
we adopt
SentiStrength for
sentiment
analysis to build our
subjec-
tivity model , because the fine-grained sentiment strength it
outputs could give us more detailed opinions than binary
polarity.
Subjectivity Model
In this section, we firstly give the definition of subjectivity
model,
then describe the method of building subjectivity
model,
and finally apply subjectivity model
to the retwe-
eting analysis problem.
Definition
Subjectivity has been extensively studied by psychologists
to characterize the personality of
a person based on his
historical behaviors and remarks [12]. Linguists define the
subjectivity of language as the speakers always show their
perspectives,
attitudes and sentiments in their
discourses
[36].
Social
media provides users a platform to express
their
opinions
toward topics
of
interest
to show their
personal
subjectivity
by
publishing
short
messages.
Therefore,
for
the term ‘‘subjectivity,’’
we refer
to both
topics and opinions articulated in the UGC.
That
is,
we
model subjectivity not only by interests of users,
but also
200
Cogn Comput (2015) 7:198–210
123
by ‘‘what
they think about
the interests.’’ Here,
we firstly
give our definition of subjectivity model on Twitter, while
we emphasize that
our
model
can be adapted to other
social
networks platforms as well.
For a set
of users U on Twitter,
we assume there is a
topic space T containing all
topics they talk about,
and a
sentiment
valence
space
S
evaluating
their
opinions
toward these topics.
As for S,
it
is often considered as a
binary
polarities
consisting
of
positive
and
negative
sentiment,
however
we argue that
a more fine-grained
sentiment
space will
indicate more detailed opinions of
users.

Users express themselves by posting tweets on Twitter,
and each tweet

can be considered
subjective in that
it
also contains topics and opinions.
So
we also give a subjectivity model definition for a tweet as

The definition of subjectivity model given above is in an
abstract form by using latent concepts of topics and opin-
ions which need to be derived from UGC. In this paper, we
combine
subjectivity
model
with
retweeting
analysis
problem and
concrete
the
subjectivity
model
in
such
problem settings.
Retweeting Analysis Problem Statement
Retweeting is the core mechanism of information diffusion
on Twitter.
Many factors have been proved to influence
retweeting behavior [11, 24, 38]; however, few researches
have investigated the subjective motivation of
a user
to
retweet a message.
Therefore,
we will study whether sub-
jectivity model can help understanding underlying reasons
of a user’s retweeting behavior.
In fact the likelihood of a tweet to be retweeted depends
on both context
constraints and its content.
The context
such as the network of the author and the time a tweet
is
published affects whether the tweet
will
be retweeted.
A
tweet with only few or passive followers is less likely to be
retweeted,
and a tweet
published in the night
have less
chance
to be
retweeted than daytime.
Apart
from the
context constraints,
a tweet is more likely to be retweeted
by subjective users who find its content
worth to.
There-
fore,
we are not interested in modeling the tweet by itself
just as other researches [27, 28, 32], but understanding how
the content
resonate with the users who might
want
to
retweet it. We put a much stronger emphasis on the content
and try to model the user’s subjective decision by deriving
latent
topics and opinions from UGC.
Actually,
none of
contextual factors has any influence on the content
of the
tweet; therefore, we deliberately ignore context constraints
to avoid introducing contextual
bias into our analysis by
proposing Hypothesis 1.
Hypothesis 1
(H1) A tweet
is evenly visible to the fol-
lowers who subscribe to it by following its publisher.
The rationale behind this hypothesis is the motivation of
a user to retweet a message lies in that the user considers
only the tweet
content
arousing his
resonance
without
context perturbation.
On Twitter,
the ‘‘following’’
relationship is
a strong
indicator of a phenomenon called ‘‘homophily,’’ which has
been observed in many social
networks.
Homophily is a
phenomenon that people connected in a social network ‘‘are
homogeneous
with regard to many socio-demographic,
behavioral, and intra-personal characteristics’’ [25]. In other
words,
homophily implies that a user follows another user
because he finds they share similar interests. According to
the principle of homophily, we put forwards the concept of
Local Topic Space, which can be defined as follows:
Definition 3
(Local
Topic Space)
In a local
network
consisting of a user and his followers, all users concentrate
Cogn Comput (2015) 7:198–210
201
123
on limited topics derived from their UGC, and these topics
form a local topic space.
Since most
of time retweeting pertains to a local
net-
work,
we limit
our
research in understanding retweeting
behavior at a local level rather than at a global level,
and
the relatively tiny size and topic homophily of local
net-
work degrade the impact of data sparsity.
According to our Hypothesis 1,
if a tweet is published,
all followers of its author will
receive it in time,
and fol-
lowers are likely to retweet
it
if they find it
worthwhile.
Thus,
the retweeting analysis problem we study can be
stated as follows:
Let F; A; M denote the follower set, author set and tweet
set, respectively. For each tweet m ( m 2 M) and its listener
f
( f
2 F), we can define a quadruple hf ; a; m; r
fam
i where:
•
a (a 2 A) is the author of the tweet m and f
(f
2 F) is a
follower of author a.
•
r
fm
is a binary label indicating whether m is retweeted
by f .
•
Our
work
focuses
on
using
subjectivity
model
to
analyze
the
relation between the
subjectivity of
a
follower
f
and his
retweeting behavior.
Hence,
we
transform the quadruple into the Local Topic Space T
formed by the author
a and his
followers
f
f g
and
represent
f ; a; m with
their
subjectivity
models
to
analyze their relations with the label r
fm
.
Establishment of Subjectivity Model
According to the definition of
subjectivity model
,
there
are two distributions to model
the subjectivity:
the topic
distribution and the opinion distribution for
each topic.
Both of them need to be inferred from historical
content
produced by users.
However,
content
analysis on Twitter
is challenging:
The volume of tweets is so huge,
while a
single tweet
is very short
with a limit
of 140 characters,
and informal
languages
are
widely used,
which make
many supervised learning approaches
and natural
lan-
guage
processing techniques
invalid [8].
Hence,
effec-
tively modeling content
on Twitter
requires
techniques
that can readily adapt to these challenges and require little
supervision.
With state-of-the-art
topic model
and senti-
ment
analysis techniques,
we establish subjectivity model
by identifying topics and opinions in an unsupervised way
simultaneously.
Topic Analysis
The topics of a tweet
are latent
and have to be inferred
from its content.
Previous studies have tried to identify
topics from tweets by finding key words [10],
extracting
entities [1],
linking tweets to external
knowledge catego-
ries [24], or using semantic framework [14]. However, the
sparsity is
a main problem for
these methods
because
even if
users have common local
topics they still
might
refer
to a topic with different
vocabulary.
Works show
that
topic
models
such as
Latent
Dirichlet
Allocation
(LDA) model and its extensions[3, 42] have been efficient
ways to characterize latent topics of large volume corpus.
Topics
of
LDA are broader
in concept,
since a single
topic consists
of
the whole collection of
related words.
Therefore, we adopt a user-level LDA model to find latent
topics
for
users
in their
Local
Topic
Space,
and the
generative process
can be graphically represented using
plate notation in Figure 1.To distill
the topics that
users
are
interested in,
documents
of
LDA should naturally
correspond to tweets content. As our goal is to understand
the topics that
each user
is interested in rather
than the
topics
each single tweet
talks
about,
we aggregate the
tweets published by each user into a single document and
replace
documents
of
LDA with the
aggregated tweet
documents. So a document stands for a user in our model,
and a user can be represented as a multinomial
distribu-
tion over topics, which corresponds to the topic weights of
the user’s subjectivity model.
Formally,
given a set
of
users U and the number
of
topics
K,
a user
u (u 2 U)
could be represented by a
multinomial distribution h over topics with a Dirichlet prior
parameterized by a.
A topic k (k 2 K) is represented by a
multinomial
distribution b with another
Dirichlet
prior
parameterized by g.
The parameters h and each beta
k
can
be estimated by Gibbs sampling or variational inference. A
variational
inference-based topic model
package Gensim
[34] is used in our work.
Opinion Analysis
Users often express opinions toward their topics of interest
by publishing topic-related tweets.
In order to explore the
opinions of
users,
we need to understand the sentiment
embedded in each tweet. Machine learning and rule-based
approaches are two main techniques of sentiment analysis.
Machine learning approaches often need labeled data for
the training process,
which is often impossible for Twitter
Fig.

because of
the large volume of
tweets and its dynamic
language characteristics.
Therefore,
we adopt
rule-based
approaches,
which could adapt
to Twitter with good flex-
ibility by changing its particular characteristics into rules
[17,
41].
The SentiStrength package has been built especially to
cope with sentiment analysis in short informal text of social
media [41].
It
combines
lexicon-based approaches
with
sophisticated
linguistic
rules
adapted
to
social
media,
which is suitable for analyzing sentiment of tweets in our
research settings. SentiStrength assigns two values to each
tweet
standing for sentiment
strengths:
a positive (within
½1; 5)
and a negative (within ½5; 1)
sentiment
value,
both ranging from 1 to 5 on absolute integer scales, with 1
denoting neutral
sentiment
and 5 denoting highest
senti-
ment strength. Sentiment assigned by SentiStrength is not a
simple binary polarity but
a fine-grained strength,
which
can catch fine opinions in a user’s subjectivity model.
For
the convenience of
calculation,
we
map the output
of
SentiStrength to a single-scaled sentiment
valence space
½0; 8 as follows:
o ¼
p þ 3
if
jpj [ jnj
n þ 5
if
jnj [ jpj
4
if
jpj ¼ jnj
8
>
<
>
:
ð3Þ
where
p
denotes
the
positive
sentiment
value
and
n
denotes
negative
sentiment
value.
In
the
sentiment
valence space ½0; 8,
value 4 and 5 indicates neutral
sen-

while values above 5 indicate positive sentiment
and values below 4 indicate negative sentiment.
With the
sentiments of all tweets,
we can aggregate opinion toward
a topic as a sentiment distribution over sentiment valence
space ½0; 8.

Retweeting Analysis with Subjectivity Model
To understand the underlying reasons why a user retweet a
message, we try to simulate the subjective decision-making
procedure
by investigating the
relationship among the
subjectivity models of a tweet, its author and followers. We
assume that a user retweet a message because the user not
only finds
its
topics
interesting but
also shares
similar
opinions toward these topics.
In other words,
if the sub-
jectivity models of a tweet and a user are similar enough,
the user will have a very high probability to retweet it. We
call this phenomenon as ‘‘resonance’’, and assume that the
Cogn Comput (2015) 7:198–210
203
123
resonance between a tweet and users will elicit retweeting
behavior.
With the subjectivity models built for users and
tweets, we can define a similarity measurement to quantify
the resonance among them.
Formally, for a tweet m, the corresponding author a, and a
list of followers F ¼ f
f g
, for each f
2 F, we can define a
quadruple hf ; a; m; r
fm
i as Section 3.2. We firstly build sub-
jectivity model P u
ð
Þ for each user u 2 F
S
a and P m
ð
Þ for
tweet m, then define the similarity measurement as follows:
Sim m; f
ð
Þ ¼ similar P m

where
•
k is the coefficient
used to control
the proportions of
topic similarity and opinion similarity in the holistic
subjective similarity.
We initiate it by setting k ¼ 0:5,
and adjust its value in the range of ½0; 1 to optimize the
best performance of our model.
•
DistðÞ is the similarity measurement between two distri-
butions. The similarity between two distributions can be
calculated with methods such as the cosine distance [9] or
the
Jensen-Shannon Divergence
[43].
We
adopt
the
cosine distance because it
performs better
than other
measurements in our research settings. It is defined as:
Distðh

where h

denotes the distribution of

u and h
m
denotes the distribution of tweet m.
We also assume that
a user
might
retweet
another
user
because of
their
subjective resonance.
Accordingly,
we
define similarity between author a and follower f
as:

Experiment
In this section,
we investigate whether subjectivity model
can help retweeting analysis with a Twitter dataset.
Dataset
We adopt an off-the-shelf Twitter dataset of previous work
[23],
which was created with Twitter API.
1
To build the
dataset,
500 randomly selected English target tweets were
monitored in the next
few days
to find followers
who
would retweet them. Also each target tweet was chosen as
starting point
to collect
historical
data of
its author
and
followers.
Overall,
there
are
45,531
followers
and
6,277,736 tweets,
and 5214 followers who have retweeted
at
least
one target
tweet
during the
monitored period.
Summary statistics of the dataset are listed in Table 1.
The relations among a target
tweet,
its author and fol-
lowers are illustrated in Figure 2. There is a local network
structure for each target
tweet
as figure shows,
consisting
of its author and followers.
Impact Evaluation of Different Factors
In Sect.
3.4,
we model
retweeting probability with sub-
jectivity model in the form of similarity measurements 7, 9.
By setting different
value to k,
the measurements can be
transformed into different versions to model different fac-
tors that might influence user’s retweeting behavior, which
are as follows:
•
TTF Topic
similarity between Tweet
and Follower
(k ¼ 1 in measurement 7).
•
OTF Opinion similarity between Tweet
and Follower
(k ¼ 0 in measurement 7).
•
STF Subjective similarity between Tweet and Follower
(k 2 ð0; 1Þ in measurement 7).
•
TAF Topic similarity between Publisher and Follower
(k ¼ 1 in measurement 9).
•
OAF Opinion similarity between Publisher
and Fol-
lower (k ¼ 0 in measurement 9).

•
SAF Subjective similarity between Publisher and Fol-
lower (k 2 ð0; 1Þ in measurement 9).
The six similarity measurements could be grouped into two
aspects.
One is consisted of TTF,
OTF and STF,
which is
direct and explicit by modeling the tweet and its followers;
the other
is consisted of
TAF,
OAF and SAF,
which is
indirect and implicit by modeling the author and follower.
The
two aspects
reflect
properly the
local
information
diffusion structure of Twitter at micro-level as illustrated in
Fig.
2.
To evaluate the impact of different factors on retweeting
behavior,
we
compare
six
average
similarity
scores
between 5214 retweeters and 5214 randomly selected non-
retweeters.
The values of k for STF and SAF are tuned to
produce the largest
value difference between retweeters
and non-retweeters,
which are
k ¼ 0:5 on our
dataset.
Figure 3 shows the result.
As the figure illustrated,
the
similarities scores of retweeters are obviously higher than
non-retweeters for all six factors.
Specifically:
•
TTF score shows
that
a tweet
is
more likely to be
retweeted by followers who find topics it
talks about
interesting to them,
which is
consistent
with other
studies[24];
•
OTF score
shows
that
opinions
in
a
tweet
is
an
important
indicator to be retweeted by followers who
hold similar
opinions,
although other
studies[27,
32]
have shown that
sentiment
in tweet
has
impact
on
retweeting behavior,
they have not
consider the opin-
ions of followers and opinion similarity between tweet
and followers;
•
STF score shows the subjective similarity is the most
distinguishable feature among the six factors with the
largest
value difference,
which proves the importance
of subjectivity model;
•
TAF score gives
another
perspective for
retweeting
analysis from the topic similarity between author and
followers,
indicating that
followers are more likely to
retweet author with similar interests , which verifies the
homophily principle of following relation;
•
OAF score indicates that similar opinions also influence
followers’ decision of retweeting another user,
which
proves opinion homophily of following relation.
•
SAF score is interesting in that it implies that subjective
similarity between author
and followers might
cause
retweeting,
and we call
this phenomenon ‘‘tight
hom-
ophily’’ of following relation because it
requires both
topic homophily and opinion homophily.
Performance of Retweeting Prediction
The main purpose of retweeting analysis is to help users
find interesting information from the overwhelming infor-
mation streams.
Retweeting is
an important
signal
of
interestingness because users are prone to broadcast
their
favorite messages to their followers. Thus, the performance
of
retweeting prediction is a suitable evaluation for
the
utility of subjectivity model
in retweeting analysis prob-
lem. In our experiment, we evaluate the subjectivity model
in supervised machine learning framework.
As Sect. 3.2 introduced, the retweeting analysis problem
could be formulated as a quadruple \f ; a; c; r
fm
[ .
For
retweeting prediction,
we need to estimate the label
r
fm
when m; a; andf
are known.
There are 5,214 retweeters in
our dataset
who retweet
at
least
one target
tweet,
so we
extract
5214 quadruples as positive instances with their
label r
fm
¼ 1. For the other 40,317 non-retweeters, we also
extract quadruples as negative instances with label r
fm
¼ 0.
To avoid unbalance bias of
training data,
we randomly
sample 5,214 negative instances into the test dataset.
Comparison with Other User Models
Firstly,
the
comparison between our
model
with other
UGC-based user models (TF-IDF model [23], entity-based
model and hashtag-based model [1]) in retweeting predic-
tion is investigated.
As defined in Sect.
4.2,
the six simi-
larities derived from our model
are used for comparison,
because they model different factors that influence retwe-
eting behavior.
For the comparing models,
cosine similar-
ities are calculated between tweets and followers.
We use
the logistic regression classifier
of
Scikit-learn machine
learning package [29],
with 5-fold cross-validation on our
balance test
dataset.
Accuracy is
our
evaluation metric.
Performances of our model and all other models are shown
in Fig.
4.
Figure 4 also shows that
the impact
of
topic
number
of
LDA on the predicting accuracy,
our
model

arrives its peak when the number is set to 60, so we fix the
topic number as 60 in all our experiment.
As Figure 4 illustrates,
the best accuracy of 68.67 % is
achieved by the STF (Subjective similarity between tweet
and followers).
The
accuracies
of
TF-IDF model
and
entity-based model are 63.45 and 62.12 %, which are very
close to TTF (Topic similarity between Tweet
and Fol-
lowers,
63.88 %)
and OAF (Opinion similarity between
Publisher
and Followers,
62.96 %).
While for
hashtag-
based model, its accuracy is 50.76 % , which is only a little
better
than random selection (50 %)
but
not
significant.
The reason might lie in a very low usage of hashtag in our
data.
The accuracies of
the other
three model
are OTF
(Opinion
similarity
between
Tweet
and
Followers,
64.80 %),
TAF (Topic similarity between Publisher
and
Followers,
62.58 %)
and
SAF
(Subjective
similarity
between Publisher
and Followers,
66.95 %)
model.
The
results
show that
subjectivity
model
can
better
help
understanding retweeting behavior
than the
other
user
models.
Comparison with Other Factors
In this section, we feed the six similarities of our model as
features into a retweeting classification framework to ver-
ify the effectiveness of subjectivity model. We compare the
performance of our model with method of Luo et al.
[23]
which uses four feature families: Retweet History (follower
who retweeted a user before is likely to retweet
the user
again),
Follower
Status
(for
a follower,
the number
of
tweets,
followers,
friends,
being listed and whether he is
verified),
Follower
Active Time (the time users interact
with others)
and Follower
Interests
(common interests
between tweet and followers,
TF-IDF model).
We use Linear SVM of Scikit-learn package to build a
retweeting prediction framework,
leveraging two different
features sets.
One includes the six features derived from
subjectivity model
(marked as ‘‘SM6’’).
The other is the
feature set
from Luo et
al.
[23] (marked as ‘‘LUO’’).
We
use the same dataset as Sect.
4.3.1 with 5-fold cross-vali-
dation,
and accuracy as evaluation metric.
In addition,
we
set a baseline (marked as ‘‘RB’’), for which followers who
have retweeted the author’s previous tweets are predicted
as retweeters of current tweet. The result is listed in Table
2. The accuracy of baseline is 60.85 %, and two prediction
models (LUO and our SM6) both outperform the baseline
significantly. But the prediction model based on our feature
set
shows no significant
improvement
over
LUO feature
set. The reason might be that our model only tries to reflect
the
retweeting
motivation
of
users
based
on
content,
whereas other important factors associated with retweeting
behavior are not considered, such as network topology and
tweeting habit of the user.

Since it
is proved that
subjectivity model
outperforms
TF-IDF model in Sect. 4.3.1, which is used in LUO feature
set,
we propose that
retweeting prediction performance
could be improved by using features derived from sub-
jectivity model.
As denoted by ‘‘LUO()?’’ in the table,
the Follower Interests features of LUO are replaced with
our
six
features
one
by
one.
The
accuracies
are
all
improved.
It shows that
our model
is of great
importance
for retweeting prediction.
Noticing that,
the most
signifi-
cant
improvement
(LUO()?STF,
72.86 vs.
68.76 %) is
the subjective similarity feature between tweet
and fol-
lowers,
which verifies our assumption that
subjective res-
onance between tweet and followers can be considered as
the
underlying reason that
elicits
retweeting behavior.
Besides,
the improvement
by adding subjective similarity
features
between author
and followers
(LUO()?SAF,
72.05 vs.
68.76 %) is also obvious in that
the resonance
between author and follower indicates the tight homophily
between them. Finally, the last row of table is the complete
combination of
two sets
of
features
(LUO()?All)
by
adding all
six features into LUO feature set.
The perfor-
mance shows no significant improvement over adding STF
feature only, in that subjectivity model combines both topic
and opinion information, and STF is an integral feature to
model both topic similarity and opinion similarity between
tweet and followers, so it is redundant to add other separate
parts.
Case Study
In this section,
we give a vivid example to illustrate the
subjectivity model and its ability in explaining the retweet
behavior. The subjectivity models for one of the 500 target
tweets,
its author,
and two followers (one retweeter,
the
other non-retweeter) are shown as Figure 5. The right part
of each sub-figure illustrates topic distribution, and the left
part
illustrates opinions toward each topic.
It
is the four-
teenth topic that
the tweet
talks about
in the local
topic
space. Figure 6 shows top words of the fourteenth topic, the
tweets
of
author
and two followers
in a word cloud.

Content of the tweet is as follows:
Fig. 5 Subjectivity models of tweet, author and followers. In each opinion distribution sub-graph, color red stands for positive sentiment (value

green for negative sentiment (value \4) and yellow for neutral sentiment (value 4,

Tweet: ‘‘Sometimes the right
person for you was there
all along. You just didnt see it because the wrong one was
blocking the sight’’
The topic of this tweet is about ‘‘love between people’’
and the opinion is neutral, which is in accordance with the
fourteenth topic word cloud in Figure 6 and subjectivity
model of tweet in Figure 5. The author concentrates on the
fourteenth topic with 208 tweets,
and his
opinions
are
mainly neutral
(as
Figs.
5,
6 demonstrate).
As
for
two
followers,
the retweeter
has published 250 tweets about
two topics (the fourteenth and 52nd topic) uniformly and
his
opinions
toward the two topics
are mainly neutral.
While the other
one,
the non-retweeter
has
also talked
about
two topics
(fourteenth and 56th topic)
with 188
tweets,
but
he is mainly interested in the fourteenth topic
and his opinion is positive.
Although two followers have
the
same interest
(the fourteenth topic),
their
different
opinions elicit their different decision,
which verifies sub-
jectivity model can help better understanding the retweet-
ing behavior not only from topics but also opinions.
Conclusion
In this paper,
we propose a subjectivity model
to analyze
user
retweeting behavior
on Twitter.
We
assume
that
retweeting should be elicited by the subjective resonance
between the tweet
and its followers.
We define the sub-
jectivity model formally as the combination of topics and
opinions, and we put forward an algorithm to establish the
subjectivity model
leveraging statistical
topic model
and
sentiment
analysis techniques.
We demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our model for retweeting analysis problem and
show that
subjectivity
model
is
able
to
reach
better
understanding of retweeting behavior.
Our future work mainly lie in two directions. Firstly, we will
upgrade the establishment procedure of our model for more
accurate opinions by making use of concept-level sentiment
analysis resource,
i.e.,
SenticNet.
Secondly,
we will
apply
subjectivity model to other social networks analysis tasks such
as connection prediction and friend recommendation.
