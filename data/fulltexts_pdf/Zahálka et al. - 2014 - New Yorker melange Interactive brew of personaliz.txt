ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose New Yorker Melange, an interactive
city explorer, which navigates New York venues through the
eyes of New Yorkers having a similar taste to the interact-
ing user.
To gain insight into New Yorkers’ preferences and
properties of
the venues,
a dataset of
more than a million
venue images and associated annotations has been collected
from Foursquare,
Picasa,
and Flickr.
As visual
and text
features,
we use semantic concepts extracted by a convolu-
tional
deep net and latent Dirichlet allocation topics.
To
identify different aspects of the venues and topics of interest
to the users, we further cluster images associated with them.
New Yorker Melange uses an interactive map interface and
learns the interacting user’s taste using linear SVM.
The
SVM model is used to navigate the interacting user’s explo-
ration further towards similar users.
Experimental
evalua-
tion demonstrates that our proposed approach is effective
in producing relevant results and that both visual and text
modalities contribute to the overall system performance.

INTRODUCTION
New York’s reputation of being a melting pot of cultures is
well-earned.
Millions of people with diverse ethnicities, na-
tionalities, and tastes live in the city, contributing to its vi-
brant, cosmopolitan atmosphere.
Tens of millions of visitors

come to the Big Apple yearly to enjoy the city,
pondering
what places in New York to visit.
There are numerous re-
sources that help with the choice, such as Foursquare, Yelp,
or TripAdvisor.
These are excellent when searching venues
enjoying general popularity.
Does vox populi,
however,
suf-
ficiently reflect the individuality of New Yorkers?
Personal prism can reveal interesting places off the beaten
track.
Indeed, virtually everyone has “this little place” they
like to frequent in their hometown.
These places often do not
show up in conventional travel guides and recommender sys-
tems.
However, if the patrons of these venues exhibit a taste
similar to our own in their online multimedia trail, we might
want to visit them.
Hence,
we propose the New Yorker
Melange, an interactive venue exploration system which al-
lows the interacting users (hereafter referred to as actors)
to brew their own melange of
venues frequented by New
Yorkers (hereafter referred to as users) similar to them.
Understanding user’s preference towards a particular venue
and the aspects that make two venues similar is a non-trivial
task.
Although venue categories (e.g.,
art museum,
bar,
park,
and restaurant) assigned by some social
media plat-
forms make the analysis easier, in practice the variety of as-
pects of interest to the users may be considered too wide to
be captured by such categories.
We conjecture that those as-
pects may be naturally encoded in venue-related images and
the metadata associated with them.
While some location-
based social
networking platforms,
such as Foursquare,
of-
fer a detailed venue description together with the images of
the venues contributed by the users, with regard to content
quantities
and topical
richness
of
community-contributed
metadata, they can hardly match content-sharing platforms
(e.g.,
Flickr and Picasa).
Therefore,
in our approach we
choose to utilize a large amount of
information automati-
cally collected from multiple platforms, which we effectively
integrate by performing topical
analysis in visual
and text
domain.
In Section 2 we reflect on the related work.
In sections 3
and 4 we describe our data collection procedure and our pro-
posed interactive venue exploration system.
The proposed
approach is evaluated in Section 5, while Section 6 provides
concluding remarks.

RELATED WORK
In recent years, a number of location recommendation and
exploring applications using community-contributed content
have been proposed.
For example,
Pang et al.
mine user-
generated travelogues to select representative Flickr images
for a particular tourist destination [7].
Kofler et al.
con-
ceived a system analyzing users’ previously-captured Flickr
images to provide personalized recommendations of off-the-
beaten-track locations at a destination city of
interest [5].
Popescu et al.
analyzed a collection of Flickr images to dis-
cover existing tourist routes within a city and recommend
new ones
[8].
Another
personalized travel
recommenda-
tion system, proposed by Cheng et al., recommends optimal
routes for a particular user demographic based on user at-
tributes extracted from community-contributed images [2].
Rudinac et al.
proposed a visual
summarization approach,
using community-contributed images and associated meta-
data to discover various aspects of
a geographic area [9].
Finally,
Zhao et al.
devised a multimodal
approach to de-
tecting overlapping communities in Foursquare [12].
What sets us apart from related work is an interactive ap-
proach to venue recommendation and city exploring in which
the user preferences are learned on-line.
Additionally, in our
approach the venues are recommended indirectly, as a part
of
the like-minded users’
profiles,
which puts a strong ac-
cent on user-centricity.
Finally, to gain a better insight into
user preferences and venue properties,
we integrate multi-
media data from content-sharing and location-based social
networking platforms.
3.
DATA COLLECTION
The first step of the data obtaining process involved get-
ting the list of venues of interest.
To this end, we queried the
Foursquare API using geo coordinates corresponding to New
York City.
This resulted in a JSON database containing the
respective venue listings.
Each listing comprises informa-
tion about the venue, such as name, venue category, and geo
coordinates.
In total,
we obtained information about 7,246
verified venues.
For each venue,
we downloaded up to 200
images associated with it, resulting in a collection of 429,921
Foursquare images.
To diversify, enrich, and enlarge our dataset, we have sys-
tematically crawled Picasa and Flickr,
two popular image
sharing social sites.
Each query targeted a particular venue,
using the venue name and geo coordinates as parameters.
To alleviate incorrect geo coordinate assignments by cam-
era GPS systems and users,
we set the geo radius,
i.e.,
the
tolerated deviation from the venue’s geo coordinates,
to 1
kilometer.
Each query retrieved up to 500 images along
with associated annotations.
This process yielded 243,292
images from Flickr, and 398,968 images from Picasa.
In total,
our collection contains 1,072,181 images of New
York and associated annotations.
We believe we have sig-
nificantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio in our dataset
by including both the venue name and the geo coordinates
in the query.
The quality of
the dataset can be further
improved at the expense of the size by reducing the geo ra-
dius and/or reducing the number of
images retrieved per
venue.
Furthermore,
grouping images by categories of
in-
terest opens up exciting possibilities for further research.
Moreover, the same type of data can be obtained for any lo-
cation in the world.
Our dataset thus presents an interesting
data resource for multimedia research in general.

picted in Figure 1, consists of three key steps:
extraction of
visual
features from the images (Section 4.1),
extraction of
text features from the image annotations (Section 4.2), and
representing individual venues and users as topical clusters
(Section 4.3).
Finally,
Section 4.4 describes the interactive
exploration system as used by the actor.
4.1
Visual Features
Guided by an assumption that the venues of
interest to
the actor may share visual attributes, we extract visual fea-
tures from the images associated with them.
To this end,
we use a deep convolutional neural network as conceived by
Krizhevsky et al.
[6].
The deep net was trained on the Ima-
geNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)
2012 dataset of
1000 semantic concepts [3].
We choose to
represent each Foursquare, Flickr, and Picasa image by the
respective output of the deep net, i.e., the distribution over
the 1000 semantic concepts.
4.2
Text Features
For all Flickr images we index the text from title, descrip-
tion, and tags.
In case of Picasa images, we utilize the title,
summary, description, keywords, albumtitle, albumdesc, and
snippet
fields.
We further tokenize the text using the Nat-
ural
Language Toolkit (NLTK) [1]
and remove all
HTML
elements.
Finally, we remove common stopwords and words
appearing only once.
To index the text in a persistent man-
ner,
we use the Gensim framework [11]
designed for topic
modeling of large corpora.
After computing the bag of words
representation for each document, we perform online Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [4] to identify a small number of
topics associated with the images.
To ensure a reasonable
granularity, we set the number of topics to 100.
4.3
Clustering
Processing million images places a non-trivial
computa-
tional
load on the machine,
thus prohibiting interactivity.
Hence,
a compact representation of
individual
venues and
users is needed.
We conjecture that each venue and user
has a number of topics of interest within the respective set
of
images.
For example,
images of
a restaurant might de-
pict the food, the interior, or groups of people enjoying their
drink.
A user’s images, while potentially diverse and numer-
ous,
will
typically share topics corresponding to the user’s
main interests.
Determining a reasonable number of
top-
ics to represent users and venues provides not only a more
compact representation, but also a basis for matching them.
To obtain the topics of interest, we cluster all images asso-
ciated with a venue using the k-means clustering algorithm.
The cluster centroids represent the individual topics.

larly,
we apply the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster
all
images uploaded by a particular user and select cluster
centroids to represent user interests.
To ensure a reasonable
topical
granularity,
we choose to use k = 5 clusters.
The
clustering is performed independently for the visual and the
text domain.

Interactive Exploration
The interactive exploration pipeline within the New Yorker
Melange, conceptually depicted in Figure 2, can be decom-
posed into five steps described in this section.
Steps 2–4
take around a second on a standard PC, which makes New
Yorker Melange a responsive, truly interactive system.
Step 1:
Initial
interface:
The actor is first presented
with a set of images arranged in a grid interface.
These im-
ages illustrate individual venues, and each is the top-ranked
Foursquare image for the respective venue.
The actor se-
lects the venues of interest by clicking on the images.
Then,
two sets of positive examples are initialized to contain the
cluster centroids of the clicked-on venues for each respective
modality (cf.
Section 4.3).
The sets of
negative examples
(again, one for each modality) are initially empty.
Step 2:
Linear SVM:
To identify users similar to the
actor, we train a linear SVM separately for visual and text
modalities using the respective sets of positive and negative
examples as training data.
If
the size of
the set of
nega-
tives for any modality is smaller than two times the size of
positives, the system supplements the set of negatives with
random samples from the collection of user centroids to en-
sure good positives-negatives balance.
Step 3:
User ranking:
Each user’s relevance score per
modality is the maximum of
SVM scores assigned to the
user’s cluster centroids, i.e., each user is as relevant as their
most relevant topic.
The overall
user relevance ranking is
determined by aggregating the score rankings across modal-
ities using Borda count.
The top-5 ranked users are selected
to be displayed to the actor.
Step 4:
Venue selection:
For each displayed user,
up
to 5 relevant visited venues are selected.
The venue repre-
sentativeness score per modality is the maximum of cosine
similarities between the venue’s cluster centroids and the
user’s cluster centroids.
These scores are again aggregated
using Borda count.
Step 5:
Map interface:
The users and their venues
are displayed within the map interface depicted in Figure 3.
Each venue is represented by a thumbnail
of the same im-
age as in step 1.
Each thumbnail
is placed on the map of
Figure 3:
A screenshot with user recommendations
generated by our New Yorker Melange system.
New York at the venue’s coordinates and color-coded by
the visiting user(s).
The users themselves are anonymized.
The anonymization does not prohibit the manifestation of
individual
New Yorker stories,
but ensures the users’
pri-
vacy.
Clicking on an image thumbnail
enables the actor to
inspect the image and basic information about the venue.
The actor can indicate which user(s) are relevant using the
checkboxes.
Upon pressing the “Show more!” button,
the
cluster centroids of
users indicated as relevant are added
to the positive data and the cluster centroids of
users not
indicated as relevant are added to the negative data.
The
cluster centroids of all five displayed users are removed from
the collection of user centroids, and these users will not show
up in subsequent iterations.
After these adjustments to the
data, the system proceeds with step 2.
5.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To evaluate the effectiveness of our system in recommend-
ing the users and venues of interest to the actor, we apply a
protocol inspired by the common practices in evaluation of
recommender systems [10].
First,
we select 100 users with
the largest number of visited venues to be used as artificial
actors.
For each,
we use 4-fold cross-validation as follows.
In each step, 25% of the venues visited by the user are with-
held as test data.
The remaining venues are indicated as
relevant (cf.
Section 4.4,
step 1).
The artificial
actor then
goes through 10 interaction rounds (cf.
Section 4.4,
steps
2–4).
Whenever it encounters a venue from the test set,
it
marks the corresponding user(s) as relevant.
The system’s
performance at each interaction round is measured by recall,
i.e.,
the ratio of
the number of
encountered test venues to
the total number of test venues, averaged across four folds.
As the baseline for comparison we use an interactive rec-
ommender system architecture, utilizing the user-venue ma-
trix,
which encodes users’
preference towards venues.
The
values in the matrix are 1 when the user visited a particular
venue,
and 0 otherwise.
Initially,
the actor is represented
with a binary vector of
relevant venues.
To identify users
similar to the actor (cf.
Section 4.4, step 2), we compute the
Jaccard similarity coefficient between the actor’s vector and
the vectors of all users in the collection.
The five users most
similar to the actor are then selected and displayed on the
screen.
The displayed users are represented by their visited
venues,
selected and sorted again by Jaccard similarity to

the actor’s profile.
When the actor selects one of
the dis-
played users,
all
venues visited by that user are added to
the actor’s venue vector.
The results
presented in Figure 4 show that
the New
Yorker Melange (NYM-VT) clearly outperforms baseline at
each interaction round.
This proves the added benefit of
topical
modeling of
venues and users.
While the recall
of
0.29 yielded by our approach at round 10 may not seem par-
ticularly high at a first glance,
one should not forget that
the evaluation protocol is rather challenging.
Note that the
artificial actors will not mark displayed users that prefer dif-
ferent venues of the same type as relevant.
A closer analysis
of the experimental results reveals that when the set of the
actor’s categories of interest is reasonably sized (∼ 5 cate-
gories), the system yields a performance well above average.
Conversely,
the cases where the performance is lacking are
those when the system tries to learn too many categories
at once.
This is an expected result because, intuitively, the
taste of users having preference towards many different cat-
egories is difficult to model.
This apparent weakness can be
easily overcome by splitting the exploration of many differ-
ent topics into several
smaller sessions,
each focusing on a
small number of topics at once.
We further investigate contribution of
each modality to
the overall
performance of our proposed approach.
There-
fore,
in Figure 4 we compare the performance of
the New
Yorker Melange system (NYM-VT) with its variants utiliz-
ing only visual
(NYM-V) and text (NYM-T) information.
The results show that both visual and text modalities con-
tribute equally to the overall
system performance and that
combining them leads to a clear performance improvement.
6.
CONCLUSION
We have presented the New Yorker Melange,
a system
that gives the users an opportunity to interactively explore
the city through the eyes of New Yorkers sharing their taste.
Our experiments have shown that the proposed user-centric
approach,
which treats venues as part of
the like-minded
user profiles and iteratively learns topical preferences of the
interacting user, is effective in producing relevant recommen-
dations.
The experiments further suggest that even though
useful
information about venue properties and user prefer-
ences may be extracted from both visual
and text content,
the performance of
our
multi-modal
approach cannot
be
matched by its uni-modal
variants.
Additionally,
our work
led to a good-quality, large-scale and cross-platform dataset
whose value extends beyond the use case addressed in this
paper.
By performing topical
modeling in visual
and text
domain on the dataset,
our approach succeeds in integrat-
ing communities and content originating from very different
social media platforms.
