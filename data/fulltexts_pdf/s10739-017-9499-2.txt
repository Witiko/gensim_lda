Abstract.
Journal
of
the History of
Biology provides
a ﬁfty-year
long record for
examining the evolution of the history of biology as a scholarly discipline. In this paper,
we present a new dataset and preliminary quantitative analysis of the thematic content
of
JHB from the
perspectives
of
geography,
organisms,
and thematic
ﬁelds.
The
geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB has increased steadily since
1968,
but
the geographic coverage of
the content
of
JHB articles remains strongly
lopsided toward the United States,
United Kingdom,
and western Europe and has
diversiﬁed much less dramatically over time.
The taxonomic diversity of
organisms
discussed in JHB increased steadily between 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later
years,
mirroring
broader
patterns
of
diversiﬁcation
previously
reported
in
the
biomedical
research literature.
Finally,
we used a combination of topic modeling and
nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques to develop a model of multi-article ﬁelds
within JHB. We found evidence for directional changes in the representation of ﬁelds on
multiple scales. The diversity of JHB with regard to the representation of thematic ﬁelds
has
increased overall,
with most
of
that
diversiﬁcation occurring in recent
years.
Drawing on the dataset generated in the course of this analysis, as well as web services in
the emerging digital history and philosophy of science ecosystem, we have developed an
interactive web platform for exploring the content
of
JHB,
and we provide a brief
overview of the platform in this article. As a whole, the data and analyses presented here
provide a starting-place for further critical reﬂection on the evolution of the history of
biology over the past half-century.

Introduction
In a scathing 1990 review,
the late historian of
science John Farley
complained that,
‘‘from its ﬁrst two-issue volume in 1968,
through its
increase to three issues per year in 1982,
until
today,
Journal
of
the
History of Biology has provided an outlet for the self-perpetuating oli-
garchy of Darwin scholars’’ (Farley, 1990). ‘‘Is this healthy, I wonder?’’
Farley went on,
‘‘Has the profession now reached such a size that the
members can aﬀord to speak only to each other?’’ Farley enumerated a
variety of
themes and ﬁelds that,
in his view,
had been chronically
underserved in the pages of
JHB,
including oceanography,
ethology,
botany,
anatomy,
physiology,
biochemistry,
bacteriology,
and others.
Worse, Farley seemed to suggest that JHB had nearly missed the social
turn in the history of
science,
remaining ﬁxated on ‘‘the history of
biological concepts.’’
It is worth considering the most charitable subtext of his assertions:
that as the ﬂagship periodical
of the ﬁeld,
the contents of JHB are a
window onto the diversity and the development of the history of biol-
