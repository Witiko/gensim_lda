Abstract
Social media are an emerging new paradigm in interdisciplinary research in crisis informatics.
They bring many opportunities as well as challenges to all ﬁelds of application and research
involved in the project of using social
media content for an improved disaster management.
Using the Central European ﬂooding 2013 as our case study,
we optimize and apply methods
from the ﬁeld of natural language processing and unsupervised machine learning to investigate
the thematic and temporal
structure of German social
media communication.
By means of
topic model
analysis,
we will
investigate which kind of content was shared on social
media
during the event. On this basis, we will, furthermore, investigate the development of topics over
time and apply temporal clustering techniques to automatically identify diﬀerent characteristic
phases of communication. From the results, we, ﬁrst, want to reveal properties of social media
content and show what potential
social
media have for improving disaster management in
Germany. Second, we will be concerned with the methodological issue of ﬁnding and adapting
natural language processing methods that are suitable for analysing social media data in order
to obtain information relevant for disaster management.
With respect to the ﬁrst,
application-
oriented focal
point,
our study reveals high potential
of social
media content in the factual,
organizational and psychological dimension of the disaster and during all stages of the disaster
management
life cycle.
Interestingly,
there appear to be systematic diﬀerences in thematic
proﬁle between the diﬀerent platforms Facebook and Twitter and between diﬀerent stages
of
the event.
In context
of
our methodological
investigation,
we claim that
if
topic model
analysis is combined with appropriate optimization techniques,
it shows high applicability for
thematic and temporal social media analysis in disaster management.
1 Introduction
At a time when the earth is experiencing eﬀects of ecological
damage and climatic
change,
natural disasters are a phenomenon of high relevance and impact on society
as a whole. Beside an investigation and reduction of the root causes, an improvement

and extension of
possibilities to respond in case of
an emergency as to prevent
or mitigate its destructive eﬀects receives much attention from of
a wide variety
of
applications and interdisciplinary research in context
of
disaster management.
Currently,
a special
focus is on the potential
of social
media technology to play a
remarkable and transformational
role in the way society responds to a disaster by
enabling inclusion of activities and information from members of the public (e.g.
Palen et al.
2010; Starbird and Palen 2011).
This vivid vision of
a participatory disaster management
relies on integration
of multiple ﬁelds of computer science,
an understanding of online communicative
behaviour,
as well as on awareness of the domain of application.
Critical topics for
research and development
include acquaintance with the quantity and quality of
information occurring on social media during a disaster as well as understanding of
its permanent change and life cycle, an approach to mapping new informal sources of
information on existing formal schemata as to allow for their alignment with formal
sources and their inclusion into standardized management processes and workﬂows,
new application and special adaptation of information extraction methods.
In this paper,
we investigate the thematic and temporal structure of social media
communication in context
of
a natural
disaster.
Taking the
Central
European
Flooding in 2013 as
our
case,
we
automatically analyse
German social
media
messages from Facebook and Twitter by combining cross-sectional with longitudinal
and singular with comparative perspectives.
The insights gained should deepen the
understanding of social media communicative behaviour in crisis situations and,
in
particular,
help to ﬁll the research gap with respect to German studies in this ﬁeld.
We ensure applicability of the extracted information and categories by mapping them
on standard categories and schemata that form the conceptual basis of professional
disaster management and, furthermore, discuss the concrete potential of social media
for improvement of crisis response in Germany.
As the core method for our study,
we apply state-of-the-art
technology from natural
language processing (NLP)
and
unsupervised machine learning,
namely topic model
analysis
(e.g.
Blei,
Ng and
Jordan 2003; Griﬃths and Steyvers 2002) in combination with temporal clustering,
and develop optimization strategies to meet
the special
requirements of
the data
type.
By this methodological
decision,
we consciously question the commonly held
prejudice against unsupervised methods for social media analysis in crisis informatics
(compare Imran et al.
2015) and ﬁnally come to disprove it.
In result of our analysis, we reveal a quite well-deﬁned thematic structure of social
media communication regarding the ﬂood event and high potential of social media
for improvement
of
disaster management.
In the temporal
dimension,
we extract
three characteristic phases of social media communication that quite well reﬂect the
changing concerns of the people in course of the ﬂood event.
On basis of a match
between our results on categories and schemata from disaster management as well
as positive feedback from end-users,
we claim good applicability of
unsupervised
topic modelling techniques for social
media content analysis in crisis management.
Our topic modelling approach has become part of a social media analysis software
prototype that
is currently under consideration by German authorities for future
use in disaster management in Germany.

223
The paper starts with a background section (Section 2) that gives a description of
our case, introduces the research areas of crisis informatics and social media analysis
and deﬁnes basic concepts of disaster management which function as the reference
point for our study.
The next section (Section 3) sets the focus of our research by
mentioning our research concerns,
explaining our general methodological approach
and discussing related work.
Thereafter,
we describe the data basis of our study and
give a more detailed description of all
methods used (Section 4).
In the next two
sections, the results from the analysis of thematic and temporal structures are oﬀered
(Sections 5 and 6).
They are discussed then from a methodological
perspective as
well
as
from the point
of
view of
application and brought
into relation to the
conceptual
basis in the application domain (Section 7).
In the conclusion (Section
8),
the results are used to show the potential
of social
media for German disaster
management and to reﬂect on the methodological consequences of our study.
With
respect
to the beneﬁt
of
our work as well
as present
limitations,
we ﬁnally hint
towards some of our future plans and research ideas (Section 9).
2 Background
2.1 Digital
volunteering during the ﬂood 2013
When in June 2013,
after a period of
heavy rain,
the Rivers Elbe and Danube
burst their banks and ﬂoodwaters were threatening the cities and communities in
the east and south German states and Austria,
a huge wave of readiness to help
throughout the country was also on its way.
During these days,
not only the water
levels and amount
of
rain set
new records at
many places,
but
the engagement
of
volunteers likewise was on an unprecedented scale.
Notably,
those volunteers
organized themselves mainly via social media.
This process had been initiated independently by private people or small NGOs,
without any involvement of state agencies and professional
disaster management.
The new social
media platforms just had created an opportunity to channel
social
energy and put
into real
action a valuable potential
that
might
have been lost
otherwise.
And the viral
eﬀects of the open network made the movement rapidly
spread and grow.
For instance,
the public Facebook site ‘Fluthilfe Dresden’
founded
by a young man,
Daniel
Neumann,
got
about
12,500 followers after half
a day
and reached 2.4 million people in one week.
Before he knew how,
the young man
and two of his friends found themselves in a position to receive and answer about
60–80 messages per minute and to coordinate as much as 50,000 people (EIJK
2015).
Against
this
background,
it
is
true
that
the
resulting involvement
provided
invaluable help,
at the same time,
though,
not all actions were carried out smoothly
and ﬂawlessly (DKKV 2015).
When evaluating the event
from the point
of
view
now,
volunteers
and emergency managers
both agree that
state agencies
should
regain information sovereignty and decision-making authority and that they have
to assume ultimate responsibility in case of
a disaster (EIJK 2015).
And this is
only to be achieved by working hand in hand with volunteer’s organizations and

by becoming more present for gathering and giving information and for interactive
communication on social media (Kirchbachkommission 2013).
2.2 Social
media analysis for crisis informatics
The ﬂood in 2013 in Central Europe is just one example where the relevance of new
information technology for disaster management has been revealed.
Several
other
events,
such as Hurricane Katrina,
9/11 or the Haiti earthquake have demonstrated
before that
there is urgent
need to understand how individuals,
non-government
and government
agencies share,
disseminate,
access,
collect,
organize and process
information during a crisis. The emerging ﬁeld of crisis informatics (e.g. Hagar 2006;
Palen et al.
2007; Palen et al.
2010) is based on the insight that nowadays the ability
to eﬃciently access and distil huge amounts of complex data is crucial to situational
awareness,
knowledge building and decision-making of those responsible for saving
lives and property of people aﬀect by a crisis.
Within an interdisciplinary setting,
crisis informatics aims at
a socially and behaviourally informed development
of
information and communication technology for crisis situations.
Within crisis informatics, social media oﬀer a new opportunity for improvement of
disaster response by providing active communication channels that allow for more
eﬃcient
propagation of
information and enable participation of
the public (e.g.
Starbird and Palen 2011).
Due to their bi-directional information ﬂow,
social media
support
eﬃcient
information exchange and interaction between formal
response
agencies and the people aﬀected.
The social
aspects are inherent
in the platform
environment in form of interactivity,
network building and multiplication of eﬀects.
But so far we know quite little about the rules that govern social media communica-
tion and the spectrum of possible contents seems virtually unlimited. Any attempt at
systematic investigation or usage is easily getting lost trying to ﬁnd a path through
the overwhelming amount
of
data that
are available on social
media and that
is
getting updated every second.
In context
of
crisis informatics,
there currently are
made strong eﬀorts towards a more systematic investigation of the properties and
use of social media (e.g.
Olteanu,
Vieweg and Castillo 2015; Eismann,
Posegga and
Fischbach 2016).
Computer-based tools
can help to face the problem of
information overload
by reducing the
amount
of
information to be
examined by human end-users.
Computational
methods from the area of NLP oﬀer a wide range of possibilities
for
systematically and eﬃciently searching,
ﬁltering,
sorting and analysing huge
amounts of
data.
However,
social
media data are a relatively new topic of
NLP
research,
and,
up to now,
they confront the researchers with many questions and
challenges (e.g.
Foster et al.
2011; Baldwin 2012; Stieglitz et al.
2014).
As already
stated, social media data are Big Data not only with respect to their volume but also
in terms of dynamicity and variety.
By being the outcome of technology-mediated
social
interactions,
social
media add the dimension of
highly semantic data to
common big data dimensions (Olshannikova et
al.
2017).
At
the same time,
not
only their content
and communicative functions but
also their formal
properties
considerably diﬀer from standard NLP data types,
like News.

with rich contextual information associated,
for instance,
in form of metadata,
links
and interactive features of the respective platform environment.
At the same time,
the linguistic context inside a message can be extremely poor as texts are usually
very short or even fragmentary.
Additional
challenges to automatic processing are
placed by orthographical
errors,
slang or elements of
non-verbal
communication
like emoticons.
For all these reasons,
standard NLP methods often do not perform
well when applied to social media data but have to be reassessed,
reconsidered and
adapted as to meet the special
requirements of the data type.
No reliable unique
methodological
framework for
social
media processing is
available
so far
(e.g.
Stieglitz et al.
2014) and,
accordingly,
diﬀerent strategies to overcome the various
problems are followed by diﬀerent researchers.
Here too,
current research in crisis
informatics is making eﬀorts to treat social
media data in a more systematic and
methodically sound way (e.g.
Imran et al.
2015; Castillo 2016).
In the context
of
crisis
informatics,
there arise additional
requirements
for
a
successful
implementation of NLP techniques for social
media analysis (e.g.
Imran
et al. 2015). First, the software should be especially eﬃcient, reliable and user-friendly
and should possibly be integrated into existing standard software and workﬂows in
disaster management.
Second,
the methods should be specially chosen and adapted
to meet the needs of the end-user-group.
Hereby,
it has to be taken into account
that diﬀerent end-users may have diﬀerent interests depending on the circumstances
of the disaster and on the role they have to play in managing it (e.g.
Vieweg 2012).
Moreover,
the methods should be able to account for the fact that,
similar to the
disaster event itself,
the information needs of the end-users are time-dynamic and
go through a certain life cycle (e.g.
Vieweg et al.
2010),
and that,
besides knowing
about the current state, trend detection and prediction making are a focus of interest
for professional
decision makers.
Third,
in order to promote usability,
the results
of an NLP analysis should be directly interpretable within the general
conceptual
framework established within the user domain,
for instance,
by including the same
categories or relating to the same schemata (e.g.
Imran et al.
2015).
2.3 Basic concepts in disaster management
This
last,
conceptual
level
certainly is
the
most
fundamental
one,
because
it
predetermines the structuring of knowledge and actions within the domain. Relevant
aspects of the event are captured by it and available perspectives and roles derive
from it.
In this subsection,
we will shortly introduce three conceptual schemata that
are at
the very basis of
most
of
the categorizations in disaster management
and
that,
therefore,
will serve as the reference point for the conceptualizations within our
NLP approach.
From the point of view of disaster management, a crisis is considered to have three
basic dimensions: (1) the real event ; (2) the actions of the involved organizations; (3)
the perception of
the crisis
(BMI
2008).
Communication plays
a very important
and very characteristic role in each case.
In the ﬁrst dimension,
there is need for
quick and precise information on the event;
the second dimension comes
with
requirement for eﬃcient and clear action-related communication between partners

under-Fahrer et al.
in diﬀerent
institutions,
locations,
cultures;
in the third dimension,
processes like
trust building, opinion formation and emotion management open up social, political
and psychological aspects of communication (ibid.).
As a second basic conceptual schema, on top of this general dimensional structure
of an event,
crisis management assumes a disaster life cycle in the sense of a generic
temporal structuring into several characteristic stages.
There are diﬀerent models in
use in diﬀerent
organizations and countries (Baird 2010)
but
the most
basic one
divides a disaster event up into three diﬀerent stages: (A) preparedness; (B) response;
(C) recovery.
(Often a fourth phase – mitigation – is assumed to ﬁll
the time when
no event is actually taking place.) Each stage is characterized by certain situational
pattern,
tasks and risks (ibid.).
In the same context,
the concept of diﬀerent alarm levels is a third basic schema
we want to include here.
On the basis of objective measures like,
for instance,
water
levels,
it deﬁnes temporal transition points between phases of a certain type of event
that
trigger speciﬁc compulsory actions for the emergency forces to take (Gr
¨
un
2014).
For water level alarms,
for instance,
the four alarm levels in Germany include
(LUBW and LfU 2015)
(1)
reporting ;
(2)
control ;
(3)
watch;
(4)
response.
Trying
to loosely relate alarm levels for ﬂood in Germany to the aforementioned general
concept of disaster life cycle,
one would certainly set the point in time where alarm
level
1 is reached as the start
of
the preparedness phase,
map the highest
alarm
level
4 to the response stage,
and leave some time after for short-term recovery,
maybe taking normal
water height
as a possible end point.
One should keep in
mind,
though,
that
event
phases,
in diﬀerence to alarm levels,
are not
absolutely
temporally ﬁxed but constitute a very ﬂexible schema.
Stages can repeat or overlap
and depend on the entire circumstances of the concrete event (e.g.
Baird 2010).
As one example that
will
have to play a role in what
follows here,
Figure 1
shows the hydrological
development and alarm level
proﬁle for the ﬂood 2013 by
the example of the river Elbe in the city Dresden (LfULG 2014).
The x -axis shows
dates,
the y-axis shows water levels in cm and the horizontal lines mark alarm levels
in increasing order from bottom to top.
Equally important in connection with ﬂood
events are weather alarms.
The most critical
weather phases during the ﬂood 2013
were,
ﬁrst,
the start of alarm phase for heavy rain 29th May with highest alarm level
at several locations around 2nd June and second,
around 19th or 20th June highest
alarm level at many locations referring to thunderstorm,
storm,
hailstorm and heavy
rain (ibid.).
These approximate weather alarm dates have been added to Figure 1 in
form of exclamation marks.
While the disaster life cycle as described above as our second schema is focusing on
the objective level of the event and the actions to be taken by disaster management,
there is another, supplementary version of this schema also relevant in the context of
this paper. In its second version, the disaster life cycle is taking the perspective of the
aﬀected people as well as helpers and describes their typical emotional reactions as
following predictable patterns (e.g. Mahon 2011). In the threat phase, while expecting
the impact
of
the disaster,
people are under big uncertainty and their emotional
state commonly is very vague.
The impact of the event often even causes a shock
at
ﬁrst
and may brieﬂy paralyse people,
but
soon after
there usually starts

heroic phase characterized by high activity and altruism.
After the event passed and
short-term recovery started,
people typically live a high emotional honeymoon phase
and there appears strong empathy and community coherence.
As before,
there can
be interruptions and fall-backs,
depending on recurring threat level or new impacts.
(Later on,
there are long-term emotional
eﬀects that play a very important part in
disaster psychology.
But as we focus on the period of the actual event in our study,
those long-term eﬀects will not further be discussed here.)
3 Focus of our research
3.1 Research concerns
In the context of crisis informatics, the paper intends to make a twofold contribution
– one on the level of application and one on the methodological level.
First,
from the point
of
view of
disaster management,
we will
investigate the
content and concrete potential
of German social
media by conducting a statistical
analysis of social media data created during the ﬂood 2013 in Germany and Austria.
We will examine data from the two big social media platforms Facebook and Twitter
and reveal
their thematic structure and content.
On this basis,
we will
furthermore
draw a comparison of the thematic proﬁle in each case.
In addition to considering
the ﬂood event as a whole,
we will
analyse its temporal
structure and development
over time.
Taking this dynamic perspective,
we want
to ﬁnd out
which kind of
content is available and prevalent at which point in time and seek to learn about the
evolution of trends.
Building on the outcome of this dynamic content analysis,
we
will
try to identify characteristic phases of social
media communication during the
event.
Again,
the results of the dynamic and time phase analysis of Facebook and
Twitter content will
be used as a basis of comparison between the two platforms
with respect to their potential for disaster management.
Second,
from the point of view of crisis informatics,
we will have to ﬁnd methods
especially suitable for dealing with the high volume, dynamicity and variety of social
media data and allow for a very eﬃcient extraction and condensed presentation of
information relevant for disaster management.

principle in line with our
discussion in 2.2,

under-Fahrer et al.
in order
to grant
strong applicability within the user
domain,
will
have to go
hand in hand with an adaptation and integration on the level
of
function and
conceptualization.
This means,
ﬁrst,
that
we have to ﬁnd methods that
allow for
diﬀerent perspectives on the data and diﬀerent levels of detail depending on diﬀerent
interests of
end-users.
Second,
on the conceptual
level,
we will
aim to meet
the
ambitious demand to relate the results of
our NLP analysis to basic concepts of
disaster management, in particular to the diﬀerent dimension of a crisis, alarm levels
and to the disaster management life cycle in its two versions as introduced in Section
2.3.
Our main methodological
interest is to prove the applicability of unsupervised
techniques within crisis informatics.
Bringing into play the research perspective of
NLP for social media analysis,
our investigation faces an additional challenge.
With
focus on the core method chosen in this study,
we need to be prepared to handle
peculiarities of social
media data and to ﬁnd ways to successfully apply,
modify or
extend the standard approach.
3.2 Methodological
approach
In our
study of
social
media content,
we will
conduct
two consecutive rows
of
statistical
experiments
focusing on an investigation of
thematic
and temporal
structure of
ﬂood-related social
media data,
respectively.
At
this point,
we want
to give a short outline on our general
methodological
approach; a more detailed
description of the particular methods is to follow in Section 4.
The core method for our analysis will
be topic modelling (e.g.
Blei
et al.
2003;
Griﬃths and Steyvers 2002).
In face of the problem of information ﬂooding,
topic
modelling oﬀers a state-of-the-art
technique which is able to reveal
the thematic
structure in huge collections of documents.
In a ﬁrst row of experiments in Section
5,
we will conduct an latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model analysis on our
German Facebook and Twitter corpora related to the ﬂood in 2013.
The application
of special optimization techniques will play an important part here. As an additional
analysis step,
we will apply a simple approach of sentiment analysis on LDA results
to support manual interpretation of topics.
Regarding the assumption that thematic structures considerably change over time
in relation to communicational
conditions and happenings on the event level,
we
furthermore will
look at our corpora from a dynamic point of view.
In Section 6,
the results of topic model analysis will be further used for an investigation into the
development of topics over time. On basis of topic distributions per day, we will apply
and optimize temporal clustering techniques in order to automatically set temporal
boundaries between diﬀerent thematic phases of communication on the ﬂood event.
Two supplementary sets
of
experiments
in Sections
5 and 6 will
conduct
a
diﬀerential
analysis in context of two diﬀerent comparative studies.
Following our
topic model analysis in Section 5,
we will test a hypothesis regarding the diﬀerences
in content between our ﬂood-related corpora from diﬀerent social media platforms.
As a supplement
to Section 6,
we will
use the data sets that
correspond to the
diﬀerent
stages
identiﬁed before
in order
to analyse
and compare
the
content
available in the diﬀerent temporal phases of the event.

As an important methodical feature of our approach, both of our main methods –
topic model analysis and temporal clustering – belong to the family of unsupervised
machine learning techniques
that
seek to identify hidden structure in unlabelled
data.
Unsupervised techniques have advantages over supervised ones in cases where
the structural
classes are previously unknown and need to be discovered or where
preparing labelled training examples would be too costly and time-consuming.
On
the other hand, the issue of relating the output of an automatic analysis to conceptual
and methodological pre-conditions on the application side becomes especially urgent
in case of an unsupervised setting (compare,
e.g.
Imran et al.
2015: 24).

While much of
the published social
media research is conﬁned to questions of
network and community structure,
less work has presented a systematic analysis
of
the textual
content,
and applications
of
unsupervised methods
are especially
rare.
Although topic modelling algorithms have evolved greatly over the past years,
the prevailing opinion is that
they do not
work well
with social
media content
but
mainly produce bad results and incoherent
topical
clusters (e.g.
Zhao et
al.
2011).
The sparseness of context within messages is seen as especially critical.
The
focus of most research,
therefore,
is on various attempts to improve on the results,
for instance,
by introducing additional
pre-processing methods or special
pooling
strategies
(e.g.
Mehrotra et
al.
2013).
In the context
of
crisis
informatics,
up to
now,
the dominant view is that structured information extraction for social
media
needs supervised methods with manually prepared categories (e.g.
Palen et al.
2010;
Starbird and Palen 2010; Starbird and Palen 2012; Vieweg et al.
2010; Imran et al.
2013; Reuter,
Heger and Pipek 2013; Reuter and Schr
¨
oter 2015; Ramage,
Dumais
and Liebling 2010 for hybrid approach with partial labelling).
Similarly,
research into the development of social media content over time and its
temporal structuring in relation to a disaster event either prefers to stick directly to
observable features (e.g.
keyword counts) or manual
annotated labels (e.g.
Parsons
2015) or likewise falls back on supervised methods (e.g. Yang et al. 2013; Chowdhury
et al.
2013; Iyengar,
Finin and Joshi 2011).
In the general research context of topic modelling, dynamic topic models have been
proposed as a way to extend traditional
state space models to identify a statistical
model of topic evolution (Blei and Laﬀerty 2006b). A more recent version of dynamic
topic models (Wang,
Blei and Heckerman 2008) replaces the original discrete space
with a continuous space referring to the Brownian motion law.
On this basis,
topics
are divided into sequential
groups and topics in each slice are assumed to evolve
from the ones in the previous slice.
Although this type of approach generally seems
very interesting in the context of our research,
some ﬁrst experiments we did with
dynamic topic models did not produce very promising results.
We suspect that the
short
time-span,
uneven temporal
distribution and ﬁne granularity of
our social
media data basis for temporal analysis causes data sparseness within time segments.
There are a few unsupervised approaches to temporal
segmentation which in-
tegrate with results from topic modelling,
most closely related Theme Delta (Gad
et al.
2015).
In contrast to our approach,
though,
Theme Delta builds up the topical
basis by calculating a separate model for each time segment.
Moreover,
it has been
designed for and applied to more standard data (like News or transcripts of political
speeches)
rather than social
media.
According to our estimates,
the properties of
our data basis for temporal analysis,
just as described in the previous paragraph,
is
a strong argument against this kind of application of topic modelling on each time
segment separately because of data sparseness within segments.
Finally,
research on social media up to now appears to be very much dominated
by English language studies and something similar holds true for investigations into
social
media use during crisis events where a majority of case studies is concerned
with crisis events in the USA (e.g.
Hughes and Palen 2009;
Vieweg et
al.
2010;
Starbird and Palen 2010).

systematic research into properties and

Moreover,

on Twitter with only very few available examples of more extended or systematic

4 Data and methods
4.1 Data
Covering the period of the core ﬂood event from the end of May to the start of July in
2013, we have collected German data from the social media platforms Facebook and
Twitter via their public API.
Figure 3 shows the development of relative frequencies
of documents in each case.
In order to prepare for further discussions in the paper,
we related obvious peaks in document frequencies to important happenings on the
event level.
In more detail, for the Facebook ﬂood corpus, we retrieved data from public pages
or groups containing the words ‘Hochwasser’ (ﬂood) or ‘Fluthilfe’ (ﬂood aid) in their
names.
Taking the ﬁrst signiﬁcant rise in frequency of messages as the start of the
event from the point of view of the medium Facebook and their apparent asymptotic
approximation back to normal
level
as its end,
we focused on the time from 1st
June to 30th June.
The resulting sample corpus consisted of 36.377 messages from
264 public pages or groups.
For the Twitter ﬂood corpus,
we retrieved the current
version of
the research
corpus
of
the
QuOIMA project
(QuOIMA 2011).
The
QuOIMA corpus
was
collected ﬁltering by sixty-ﬁve hashtags coming from Twitter research on a sample of

relevant messages and from terms related to disaster scenarios used by the Austrian
Bundesheer as well
as by twenty-nine names of manually chosen public accounts
connected to disaster management and ﬂood aid (ibid.).
Again,
using rise and fall
of document frequency as our basis for detection of the core event,
we focused on
the period between 30th May and 1st July in case of Twitter.
The resulting corpus
comprised 353.981 tweets.
The demands with respect to pre-processing were kept quite low.
Preprocessing of
the corpora included deletion of punctuation marks and stop words,
tokenization
and lemmatization,
transformation to lower case and deletion of tokens with length
or frequency smaller than 2.
Numbers were mapped on a generic reference (Num).
Moreover,
we performed removal
of
URLs
and usernames
marked with the @
sign.
In case of
Twitter,
we additionally removed hashes from hashtags and left
out retweets.
After this preprocessing,
we had a Facebook ﬂood corpus of 28,144
messages/1,297,409 word tokens and a Twitter ﬂood corpus of 194,998 posts/416,302
word tokens
which we used for
analysis
and training for
topic modelling and
temporal clustering.
For
diﬀerential
analysis
of
key-terms
in our
supplementary analysis
step,
we
applied a few additional pre-processing steps.
In context of the comparison of them-
atic structures,
location markers were mapped on the string ‘LOC’; for comparison
of
temporal
structures,
we deleted names of
places and regions,
rivers and water
bodies,
proper names (except for important politicians like the German chancellor
Merkel).
4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Topic model
analysis
In order to reveal
thematic structure in our data collections,
topic model
analysis
on social
media posts will
be applied.
Topic models (e.g.
Blei
et al.
2003; Griﬃths
and Steyvers 2002; Steyvers and Griﬃths 2005) are a family of statistical
models
based upon the idea that
documents are mixtures of
topics.
We choose the most
basic and well-understood model here,
namely LDA (Blei et al.
2003).
As a feature
we take as essential in context of application,
LDA allows for systematic parameter
selection while retaining analyst control.
Topic model
techniques have proven very
useful
for searching,
browsing,
summarizing and soft clustering of large collections
of documents.
Their application does not require any prior annotations or labelling
of documents since the topics emerge from the analysis of the original texts.
In an LDA model,
each of the K topics is deﬁned as a multinomial
distribution
β over the words from the vocabulary.
The content
of
a document
then is given
in form of a multinomial
distribution θ over the topics.
The observed data are the
words in each document;
the topics themselves and how each document
exhibits
them represent the latent or hidden topical
structure which gets derived by means
of
statistical
inference.
The topic words pick out
a coherent
cluster of
correlated
terms and allow via β for an intuitive interpretation of
the topics and via θ for
an interpretation of
the content
of
documents.
We will
infer β and θ from the
maximum likelihood estimation of the posterior probabilities of the model variables

Topics and topical
phases
233
after running Gibbs Sampling for 1,000 iterations on each of our two corpora.
Posts
and tweets will be used as the respective document units for our analysis.
In order to optimize the outcome of
LDA topic model
analysis,
we will
per-
form model
selection by combining numeric optimization procedures with manual
evaluation.
Although it is possible to optimize the model
parameter in an entirely
automatic manner,
selecting ‘good’
settings in application-oriented qualitative data
analysis scenarios is quite an intuitive undertaking that
has to take into account
complex conditions
and interests
within the application domain and should be
carried out carefully by human analysts (e.g.
Evans 2014; Wiedemann 2016).
For making the numerically optimal
choice for K,
we will
start by considering a
range of K values that seems potentially useful in face of the intended application.
For our optimization procedure, we then will refer to a measure of reliability (Niekler
2016).
Reliability is known as a methodological
quality factor that ensures stable
outcome of a method given identical input (R
¨
ossler 2005). Topic modelling inference
involves stochastic processes which,
depending on the structure of the data,
cause
variability in the outcome of
their application due to numerous local
maxima in
the probability space (Lancichinetti
et
al.
2015).
Systematic investigation of
the
outcomes of multiple runs of such a non-deterministic algorithm is able to reveal
which parameter setting produces signiﬁcantly more stable structures than others
(Greene,
O’Callaghan and Cunningham 2014).
The measure of reliability conducts
such an investigation by bipartite matching of topic pairs from repeated runs of a
topic model algorithm.
This is realized by calculating cosine distances of topic-term
distributions β and β

from two diﬀerent models. A topic β
i
is considered as a match
for β

j
when their distance is below a certain threshold t = 0.2 and there is no other
topic β

¬j
with a lower distance:
match(β
i
, β

j
) =

1,
dist(β
i
, β

j
) < t ∧ dist(β
i
, β

j
) < dist(β
i
, β

¬j
)
0,
otherwise
(1)
dist(a, b) = 1 −
a · b
ab
(2)
Since term probabilities representing the latent
meaning of
a topic accumulate
only on a small subset of the entire vocabulary,
cosine distance calculation is based
on the N = 50 most
probable words
of
each topic.
The overall
reliability rate
between two models then is the proportion of matchable topic pairs:
reliability(β, β

) =
1
K
K

i=1
K

j=1
match(β
i
, β

j
)
(3)
For selecting an optimal
parameter K,
reliability should be as high as possible
so that stable and signiﬁcant structures are inferred by the model.
The outcome of
model
parameter selection by this numerical
optimization will
ﬁnally be checked
by manual
evaluation of
the model
results to ensure a good interpretability and
applicability within the user domain.
Manual
evaluation is approached by group discussion of analysts reaching for a
consensual interpretation of results from the modelling process in the light of their
terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324918000025

domain knowledge.
To support this discussion process,
we utilized LDAvis (Sievert
and Shirley 2014),
a software tool
for
visualization of
topic model
results
and
relevance ranking of topic-deﬁning terms.
In a ﬁnal
step,
the selected models were
evaluated by an inter-annotator agreement test to judge on their overall quality.
For
randomly sampled social media posts, two domain experts were asked to identify the
primary and secondary topic given the topic labels and twenty-ﬁve top topic words
from our selected models.
Their selections were then compared to the true primary
topic of the posts by calculating an agreement statistic (top1-accuracy measures how
often the user-selected primary topic of a sample post is also its true primary topic;
top2-accuracy measures how often the user-selected primary or secondary topic is
also the true primary topic).
Besides K,
the LDA modelling is governed by hyperparameters α and η which
are the settings of
the prior distributions θ and β,
respectively.
We will
perform
optimization of
the α parameter (for document’s topic distribution)
by using two
diﬀerent
measures
– perplexity
and topic coherence.
1
Again,
the
results
of
the
numerical
evaluation process will
be manually checked.
The perplexity measure is
used in the majority of the literature (e.g. Blei et al. 2003; Rosen-Zvi, Chemudugunta,
Griﬃths,
Smyth,
Steyvers
2010;
Blei
and Laﬀerty 2006b),
and,
intuitively,
relies
on the
amount
of
surprise
a trained model
experiences
when being presented
unknown documents after the learning phase.
A lower perplexity indicates better
generalization capability of the model. More recently, the measure of topic coherence
has been proposed (Mimno et al. 2011), which better reﬂects correspondence between
numeric evaluation and the user perception of the quality of topic models. Coherence
observes
word co-occurrence of
the top terms
of
each topic in documents
of
a
collection and favours models which have more actually co-occurring terms as top
terms.
In consequence,
models with higher coherence model documents as mixtures
of
few,
descriptive topics with high probabilities rather than as a composition of
numerous broader topics with more equal probabilities.
Finally,
we will
take two additional
steps to improve interpretability of topics in
our chosen model.
Because common terms in the corpus often appear near the top
of the ranked word list for multiple topics,
they can make it hard to diﬀerentiate
the meanings of
these topics (compare,
e.g.
Sievert
and Shirley 2014).
This eﬀect
is especially strong in cases where all
topics belong to a common super-topic (in
our case ‘ﬂood’).
Therefore,
we will
systematically decrease the ranking of globally
frequent
terms.
Instead of
ranking the topic words w for a topic k just
by their
probability β
k,w
obtained from the model
posterior,
we will
additionally take into
account
their probabilities over all
topics and determine a rank for w in k (cp.
function by.score in the Cran.r package lda):
β
k,w

Since we are primarily concerned with topic speciﬁcity to describe documents governed by
α,
we will
decide for the default value 1/K for the η prior as implemented in the gensim
topic model library (Reh

Topics and topical
phases
235
As a second step,
we compute sentiment scores for each topic.
Sentiment analysis
is an NLP task concerned with measuring subjective opinion or aﬀective states in
textual
data (Pang and Lee 2008).
To support
interpretability of
our
topics,
we
compute a sentiment score using the freely available sentiment dictionary SentiWS
(Remus, Quasthoﬀ and Heyer 2010). SentiWS contains 3.456 German terms classiﬁed
as either positive or negative.
As a basic sentiment score for a topic k,
we deﬁne the
sum of probabilities of SentiWS terms in that topic:
sentimentScore(k) =

w∈SentiWS
β
k,w
(5)
The score can be interpreted as a proportion of sentiment terms regarding the
overall
probability mass of a topic.
Moreover,
to be able to compare both of our
social
media collections,
we calculate the share of
sentiment
terms regarding the
number of tokens in each collection.
4.2.2 Temporal
clustering
The topic probability distributions from our topic model
analysis will
serve as the
basis for our investigation into the development of thematic structures over time.
The basic idea is to automatically identify time segments where topic distribution
is uniform and segment boundaries around where signiﬁcant changes are occurring.
Our approach will follow the main methodological path developed in previous work
in Wiedemann (2016) for News corpora.
Using topic distribution rather than,
for instance,
word counts for identiﬁcation
of time periods has some major advantages.
While clustering on word frequencies
per time slice may produce reasonable results in case of rather equally sized time
slices,
our data is very unevenly distributed.
Experiments we did with clustering on
simple and normalized frequencies with either cosine or Jensen–Shannon divergence
as distance measure showed that
clusters largely follow patterns of
similar token
quantities instead of capturing semantic change.
For instance,
for our collection of
Facebook postings,
this resulted in clusters of one day in the beginning,
two days
at the end and a large block of twenty-nine days in the middle of the data set.
This
basically reﬂects the situation of
very low amounts of
postings at
the beginning
and the end of
our investigated disaster event,
which is not
very helpful
for any
analysis.
In contrast,
clustering based on topics is robust against high variance in
the distribution of
documents over time,
since topic proportions are determined
in a ﬁxed values range.
Moreover,
the data basis for clustering represents latent
semantics in lower dimensional space which facilitates interpretation of clusters (see
Section 6).
To get a dynamic perspective on the topics within a corpus,
we will ﬁrst aggregate
and average topic probabilities of every posting p ∈ P per day d ∈ D.

=
1
|P

This results in a |D|

dissimilarity of
topic distributions between all
pairs of
days,
which can serve as
the basis for a clustering algorithm.
In line with other NLP research conﬁned to
comparing topic model
probability distributions (e.g.
Endres and Schindelin 2003;
Hall et al.
2008),
we use the square root of Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) (based
on the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL)) our distance metric.

KL(x : y) =

log(
x

)
(9)
In face of the rather gradually changing nature of language data,
we decided to
apply a parametric rather than non-parametric algorithm for temporal
clustering.
This
means
that
data points
will
be
assigned to a previously deﬁned number
of
K clusters.
The proper
selection of
K can be heuristically supported by a
numerically optimal
solution determined by a cluster quality index.
An alternative
heuristic would choose the number of clusters manually,
focusing on conditions and
demands on the end-user side.
For instance,
from the point of view of usability,
a
numerically optimal solution of, let us say, ﬁfty clusters may be considered less good
as a numerically slightly lower ranked solution of 5.
As before,
we will
take into
account both strategies in order to optimize applicability of results. As algorithm for
temporal
clustering,
we chose partitioning around medoids (PAM) (Reynolds et al.
2006).
In contrast
to other
parametric algorithms,
like K -means,
cluster
centres
are not
represented by means of
all
assigned observations,
but
PAM uses cluster
representative data points.
In comparison to K -means,
the algorithm not only runs
faster but has the advantage of an entirely deterministic behaviour.
For numerical
optimization of
the number of
clusters,
we will
apply the widely used Calinski–
Harabasz (CH) index (Calinski and Harabasz 1974).
The CH-index is deﬁned as a
normalized quotient of separation and compactness of the clustered data and has
been used to determine optimal cluster numbers in many application scenarios.
4.2.3 Diﬀerential
analysis
Extraction of
keywords
is another,
more traditional
way to gain insight
into the
content
of
a corpus (Scott
1997).
Moreover,
the method is especially suitable for
comparative language studies and will be applied for this purpose here. The ‘keyness’
of
a word can be measured on the basis
of
its
relative frequency in the target
corpus in comparison to a benchmark taken from a reference corpus.
Based on
the observed occurrences
of
a word in the reference corpus,
expectations
of
its
frequencies within the target corpus are calculated and the deviation of the actually
observed frequency from the expected one then is assessed using a statistical
test.
Those words
occurring with signiﬁcantly higher
relative frequency in the target
corpus,
are seen as characterizing its content relative to the reference corpus.
In our
study,
we will
apply the log-likelihood ratio test
(Dunning 1993)
as it
has proven
particularly appropriate for language data (Rayson and Garside 2000).

5 Thematic structures
5.1 Results from Facebook topic model
analysis
5.1.1 Model
selection
In order to choose the optimal
LDA model
for our Facebook ﬂood corpus,
we
performed model
selection in line with the method described in Section 4.2.1.
For
determining the best
number of
topics K,
we calculated models for a range of
5
≤ K ≤ 15.
As a basis for testing reliability,
we repeated processing twenty times
for each K and calculated reliability by pairwise comparison between all runs using
the ﬁfty most probable words in each topic and a threshold for cosine distance of
0.2.
The reliability for a certain K then is given as the average of the reliabilities
of the twenty runs.
Additionally,
we applied t -test to make sure that the diﬀerence
in reliability of a K -topic model
compared to the reliability of a potentially more
detailed and informative K +1-topic model
is statistically signiﬁcant.
Table 1 (left)
shows the reliability measure for the diﬀerent K together with the respective p-value.
In result of this analysis,
K = 6 gets revealed as the numerically optimal choice for
the number of topics in the Facebook corpus as the six-topic model is signiﬁcantly
more reliable than all more ﬁne-grained models with K > 6 (and even more reliable
than the less-detailed ﬁve-topic model).
As
the next
step for
model
selection,
we tested for
the best
choice for
the α
parameter applying the measures of
perplexity and topic coherence as described
in Section 4.2.1.
The two diagrams 4.a and 5.a show the result
of
the respective
experiments (with ﬁxed K = 6 and η = 1/K).
Both measures agree that an α value
of
0.05 should be chosen for performing LDA topic model
analysis because the
resulting model
shows the lowest perplexity and highest coherence in comparison
to all
alternative setting for α.
We qualitatively checked the results with respect to
its potential applicability in our user domain.
The check conﬁrms parameters from
our unsupervised process lead to more informative and better interpretable models
compared to diﬀerent
settings.
In the ﬁnally conducted agreement
test,
domain
experts
were able to identify the most
prominent
topic of
a Facebook post

seventy-one per cent/Cohen’s kappa = 0.65 (top1-accuracy)
resp.
eighty-four per
cent/Cohen’s kappa = 0.81 (top2-accuracy) of the sampled test cases.
This result
signals that the model captures coherent,
interpretable semantics of the application
domain very well.
5.1.2 Facebook ﬂood topics
Table 2 summarizes the results from our LDA topic model
analysis for Facebook.
In the third column,
the twenty most relevant words for each topic are displayed
together with an English translation.
They are ranked according to their probability,
coming from the model
plus our ranking method described in Section 4.2.1.
In the
right
column,
we have proposed a title for each topic on basis of
relevant
topic
words and their thoroughly manual
investigation using the LDAVis tool.
The ﬁrst
two columns show topic proportions regarding the entire collection and sentiment
scores,
respectively.
The topic proportions are further illustrated in form of a topic
wheel in Figure 6.
The ﬁrst topic,
according to Table 2,
is concerned with oﬀering,
asking for and
coordinating volunteer’s
help.
Furthermore,
there is
the large topic 2 on giving
emotional support to the aﬀected people and thank the helpers. Similarly, important
is
topic 3,
regarded with the organization of
donations
in kind.
Donations
in
money are covered by topic 4,
together with some information on school
closures.
Furthermore,
there
is
the
more
factual
topic
5,
including current
information
on water
levels
and resulting road closures.
Finally,
topic
6 gives
information
on acute current
situations
and how they are handled by professional
disaster
management.
For the further ﬁgures,
we selected the following colour code in order to support
interpretation of
results:
topics dealing with the current
state of
the event
were
colour-coded in shades of blue colours; topics dealing with helping in green; topics
dealing with ﬁnancial issues in yellow; topics involving social emotions in red; topics
being somewhere in-between are encoded as a mix of the basic colours (e.g. turquoise
as being between blue and green,
purple between blue and red).
As can be seen from the topic wheel in Figure 6,
the four socially and emotionally
relevant
topics – marked in red,
yellow and green colours – are very dominant
in the Facebook ﬂood corpus,
taking about
eighty per cent
of
the overall
topic
space.
The two topics
including factual
information on the event
– marked in
blue – contribute a considerably smaller proportion.
The overall share of sentiment
terms in the Facebook corpus is 14.3 per cent,
with 11.2 per cent positive emotions
clearly dominating over 3.1 per cent negative ones.
The most emotional
and most
positive topic is the one concerned with emotional
support and thanks.
The most
negative topic and the only one where negative emotions
are more prominent
than positive ones,
is related to information on the current situation and disaster
management.
Like for the other topics with relative strong negative emotions,
the
negative sentiment scores are mostly associated with the numerous disaster terms
here,
rather than coming from explicit emotional assessment or involvement by the
people.

5.2 Results from Twitter topic model
analysis
5.2.1 Model
selection
The steps we took for selecting the optimal
model
for the Twitter ﬂood corpus
are exactly corresponding to those just
described for
Facebook.
Repeating the
calculation of
models
twenty times
for
diﬀerent
K gives
rise
to the
reliability
measures and p-values in Table 1 (right).
In result,
K = 6 is chosen as the optimal
parameter setting because the six-topic model is signiﬁcantly more reliable than all
models with K > 6.
Determining the optimal
value for the α prior (while K = 6 and η = 1/K) on
basis of perplexity and topic coherence left us with a value of approximately 0.1.
As can be seen from Figures 4(b) and 5(b),
both measures do not completely agree
here,
but the respective optima are very close to each other.
As coherence should
be more relevant in context of our study,
we took this as our point of orientation,
accepting perplexity to be slightly above its minimum.
The ﬁnally selected model
successfully underwent
manual
checking regarding interpretability in the light
of
domain knowledge.
In the agreement
test,
domain experts were able to identify
the most prominent topic of a tweet in sixty-three per cent/Cohen’s kappa = 0.55
(top1-accuracy)
resp.
81.5 per cent/Cohen’s kappa = 0.78 (top2-accuracy)
of
the
sampled test cases.
That the agreement is not quite as high as in case of Facebook
might be traced back to the fact that,
in overall,
the Twitter topic are more similar
to each other.
5.2.2 Twitter ﬂood topics
The results from our LDA topic model
analysis for Twitter are presented in form
of Table 3 and Figure 7 just as before.
Topic 1 in Table 3 presents weather facts in
quite a precise and technical manner.
The prominent topic 2 also is concerned with
weather but oﬀers a more subjective view on it by involving emotional assessments
by the people.
Topic 3 is very objective in style once more and refers to water levels
and alarm levels.
The focus of topic 4 is on giving up-to-date information on acute
situations in connection with the ﬂooding.
Topic 5 provides a situational
overview

and includes factual information regarding diﬀerent locations as well as reports on
ﬂood-related actions.
Only Twitter topic 6 brings in some social
aspects in form of
reports on damages and ﬁnancial ﬂood aid at the private as well as state level.
This means,
when moving from the Facebook to the Twitter ﬂood corpus,
the
semantic focus just seems to switch.
As can be read oﬀ the topic wheel
and topic
labels in Figure 7,
the main focus in case of Twitter is on giving current information
on the event.
Five out of six topics are concerned with information on the factual
level,
taking a great majority of the overall
topic space.
Only a minor proportion
of
the Twitter topical
content
is socially related.

5.3 Results from diﬀerential
analysis of Facebook and Twitter
In this section,
we take a closer look at the diﬀerences in content between the two
social media platforms and make them explicit in form of characteristic terms which
got extracted by mutual comparison of equal-sized sample corpora via log-likelihood
diﬀerential
analysis.
In the ﬁrst experiment,
the Facebook ﬂood corpus played the
role of the target corpus while the Twitter ﬂood corpus was used as the reference
corpus; in the second experiment,
roles just got switched.
Intuitively,
according to our topic model analysis,
the most striking characteristic
of
Facebook was
its
main focus
on empathy and social
interaction and on the
organization of concrete volunteer actions. Twitter, in contrast,
was prevalently used
to provide up-to-date information on the event.
These characteristics also come out
clearly as the most striking respective diﬀerences when comparing the two corpora
on the level
of lexical
content via diﬀerential
analysis.
In Table 4,
the ﬁfteen most
signiﬁcant
extracted terms
are listed.
As
one can see,
the terms
that
name the
characteristics of
Facebook compared to Twitter all
refer to asking for or thank
for help or motivating and organizing concrete supporting activities,
for instance
donations.
The characteristic terms that
are provided to tell
apart
Twitter from
Facebook,
on the other hand,
all
are related to the factual
situation in terms of
water levels and weather conditions.
6 Temporal
structures
6.1 Results from temporal
clustering for Facebook
6.1.1 Model
selection
For deciding on the optimal number of temporal clusters k,
we performed temporal
clustering with PAM for a range of
2 ≤ k ≤ 10 and then calculated CH index
for each case.
The results of this procedure can be seen in Figure 8(a).
A cluster
number of k = 3 is clearly marked as the optimal
solution for temporal
clustering
of our Facebook topics.
This number seems especially promising from the point of

given the number of event phases
according to the basic disaster management life cycle.
6.1.2 Temporal
phases in Facebook ﬂood corpus
The three diﬀerent clusters cover the time span of the core event like this: the ﬁrst
cluster corpus comprises the period from 1st June to 3rd June; the second goes from
4th June to 11th June; the third cluster covers the time from 12th June to 30th June.
In relation to the overall
document frequency,
the marked time segments roughly
correspond to the rise,
the peak and the fall of frequency (compare Figure 3).
Recall
how this course of
document
frequencies
had been brought
in close relation to
happenings on the actual level of the ﬂood event in Figure 3.
In Figures
9 and 10,
one can bring the segmentation done by our
clustering
algorithm in relation to the development of absolute and relative topic probabilities
over time.
In Figure 9,
it becomes obvious that the diﬀerent topics show diﬀerent
characteristic life cycles during the time of event.
For instance,
the dark blue factual
topic on water levels rises immediately at the start of the event and quite rapidly
falls down again at around the end of the ﬁrst time phase.
In contrast,
the green
topic,
concerned with the organization of volunteer’s help,
rises only a bit later and
has its most important period during the second phase marked by our clustering
algorithm.
Finally,
the yellow topics on donations in kind as well
as the red social
emotion topic also rise and peak during the second time segment but then live on
at a lower level during the third segment.
Even more revealing is Figure 10,
that shows the time clusters together with the
relative topic probabilities,
as it
makes explicit
that
diﬀerent
kinds of
topics are
dominating the diﬀerent time segments. While the factual topic is the most prevalent
topic in the ﬁrst
segment,
the topic about
organization of
volunteer’s actions is
the leading topic in the second segment.
The third segment is characterized mostly
by the topics concerned with social
emotions and donations.
On this basis,
one
could think of giving titles to the three clusters corresponding to the most dominant
topics
they,
respectively,
include,
and,
by this
procedure,

6.2 Results from temporal
clustering for Twitter
6.2.1 Model
selection
Just as before,
we started by using CH index for selecting the numerically optimal
number
of
temporal
clusters.
Figure 8(b)
shows
the results
for
PAM with 2 ≤
k ≤ 10.
Here a two-phase temporal
model
came out
as the numerically optimal
solution.
Unlike we had it in the case of Facebook,
though,
this solution may not
be considered optimal with respect to applicability too.
To have two distinct phases
only is not expected to be very informative and,
moreover,
is not in line with the
conceptual conditions in context of disaster management where three or more event
phases are assumed.
Therefore,
we decided to go for the second best solution from
the point of view of CH index which seems much more promising from the point
of
view of
applicability and took four clusters to temporally analyse our Twitter
corpus.
6.2.2 Temporal
phases in Twitter ﬂood corpus
The ﬁrst
cluster reaches from 30th May to 1st
June;
the second goes from 2nd
June to 12th June; the third cluster is temporally divided into two separate periods,
the ﬁrst
part
covering 13th June only and the second part
reaching from 19th
June to 30th June; the fourth cluster ﬁnally covers a time span from 14th June to
18th June.
In relation to the overall
document frequency (compare Figure 3),
the
ﬁrst and second marked temporal
clusters roughly correspond to the rise and the
peak of frequency again; the fourth cluster shows relatively constant low document
frequency.
The third cluster,
appearing as a narrow segment in the middle of the
ﬂood period as well
as a wider segment
around its end,
seems to correspond to
renewed rising,
peaking and falling of frequency.
Taking the
topical
point
of
view allows
for
more
insight
into the
temporal
structuring of
the event
and its characteristics communicative phases.
As before,
Figure 11 shows the development of topic probabilities over time.
In the ﬁrst time
segment,
all
topics appear to be on the rise,
and,
in the second one,
they do the
usual two peaks in quite a similar manner.
The yellow social topic is falling down a
bit more slowly than the factual
topics.
The middle blue topic on water and alarm
levels and the dark blue topic giving weather information in a technical
manner
appear to be the most constant ones during this period as well as during the rest of
the event.
In the fourth segment, all topics behave relatively stable at some low level.
Cluster number three in the third and ﬁfth time segment
shows some interesting
characteristics. Both times it is marked by a high rise of the purple topic that includes
subjective information and emotional comments in connection with the weather.
In
the last segment,
the other topics likewise show one renewed peaking,
though the
subjective weather topic proves the most
sensitive one,
peaking particularly high
once and going through a very unstable course of rising and falling thereafter.
Figure 12 can be used again to characterize the diﬀerent
clusters in terms of
topic prevalence within the respective time segments.
The ﬁrst
cluster in segment
one mainly is concerned with information on the current
state of
the event.

topics.
The interesting third cluster in the third and ﬁfth time segment,
ﬁnally,
is
clearly dominated by the subjective and emotional weather topic.
In order to better
interpret this cluster, we relate the relevant time segments to happenings on the level
of the actual event according to Figure 3.
Thereby,
it becomes clear,
that this cluster
reﬂects subjective alertness and relief in face of heavy thunderstorms and rains and
renewed smaller rising and falling of water levels.
After just having experienced a
huge ﬂood some days before,
people seem to be especially vulnerable and react
much stronger on an aﬀective level
than they actually did during the main event.
They even keep on observing and placing negative or positive comments regarding
the weather for quite a while after the critical
situation has passed.
In sum,
the
communicative phases of
the ﬂood event
following from our temporal
clustering
of Twitter topics might be called (1) information,
(2) help,
(3) alertness/relief,
(4)
relaxation,
(5) alertness/relief.
6.3 Results from diﬀerential
analysis of temporal
phases
In this
supplementary section,
we take a second look at
the characteristics
of
the clusters from an alternative perspective,
not
structuring content
according to
latent
topics but
zooming out
and just
looking at
the documents from a certain
period of
time all
at
once as a single time cluster corpus.
We will
make cluster
characteristics explicit in form of characteristic terms which got extracted via log-
likelihood diﬀerential
analysis,
taking the corpus
of
a particular
cluster
as
the
target corpus and the corpus comprising all
other clusters as the reference corpus,
respectively.
6.3.1 Characteristic phase terms of Facebook ﬂood corpus
In Table 5,
the ﬁfteen most
signiﬁcant
keywords for the three Facebook clusters
are shown in decreasing order.
For cluster one,
the terms are related to eﬀects of
the ﬂooding on social
life,
mainly traﬃc and schools or kindergartens and seem to
convey information on the current state.
In the second cluster,
the main focus is on
activities to ﬁght the ﬂood and the terms reﬂect engagement in the organization of
volunteer actions.
In cluster number three,
ﬁnally,
the keywords show relations to
two diﬀerent semantic domains.
First,
there appear words relating to donations or
reﬂecting on cooperation and showing emotional involvement.
Second,
there shows
up special vocabulary in connection with a particular event on June 15th and 17th
when three barges were blown up and sunk in order to close a leak in a dike near
Fischbeck.
This last semantic association should be seen as accidental
rather than
systematic, being caused by an individual sub-event rather than based on the general
development of the main event.
Put aside the accidental factors, the general characterization of the three Facebook
clusters received by diﬀerential analysis seems quite in line with the characterization
we have already set up on base of dominant topics in Section 6.1.2, just adding some
more details and special
aspects.
We interpret this result as a conﬁrmation of our

proposed cluster labels for the Facebook ﬂood corpus: (1) information,
(2) active
help,
(3) empathy and emotions.
But
more relevantly,
having available a list
of
keywords associated with every
temporal
cluster now provides us with a very simple and direct mean to monitor
the development of the event.
To test for the reliability of the respective association
between terms and clusters and for strength of the signals around phase boundaries,
we have aggregated the frequencies of
the thirty most
signiﬁcant
terms for each
cluster at every point in time and then plotted the development of these combined
frequencies over time in Figure 13.
In each case,
the combined frequencies of the
respective cluster terms peak right in the temporal cluster they are associated with.
Moreover,
looking at
the three proﬁles
of
rising and falling of
frequencies
all
together,
there seems to be derivable information on an oncoming phase boundary
ahead of time of the actual start of the respective phase.
6.3.2 Characteristic phase terms of Twitter ﬂood corpus
Table 6 oﬀers the ﬁfteen most signiﬁcant keywords for each of the four temporal
clusters we had automatically extracted from our Twitter ﬂood corpus.
According
to diﬀerential analysis,
the ﬁrst Twitter cluster includes information and warnings in
face of the upcoming ﬂooding.
The terms are referring to severe weather conditions
and rainfalls and make announcements on water and alarm levels. First ﬂoodings are
reported together with resulting traﬃc obstructions.
The second cluster still informs
about the current state of the event in terms of water level
and critical
eﬀects,
but
now vocabulary reﬂecting actions of professional and volunteers to ﬁght the ﬂooding
is included too.
In cluster three,
there appear two very diﬀerent situations that are
reported on.
On the one hand,
a state where water levels are constant or falling,
on the other hand,
and even more prominently,
a state where a severe situation

The fourth Twitter
cluster ﬁnally,
is divided into two semantic parts again.
First,
there seems to be a
relaxed state where water levels have fallen and remain constant.
Second,
we again
ﬁnd traces of this particular event where barges have been blown up and sunk to
stabilize the dike near Fischbeck.
Again, focusing on the general pattern that can be read oﬀ the clusters and leaving
aside the peculiarities like the sinking barges near Fischbeck,
the characterizations
of the Twitter clusters we just got in form of keywords are in line with the cluster
labels we had proposed on basis of
dominant
topics before in Section 6.2.2:
(1)
information,
(2)
help,
(3)
alertness/relief,
(4)
relaxation.
Generally,
it
has
to be
noted,
though,
that the semantic characterization of the clusters on basis of latent
topics seems to be more helpful and stringent for an interpretation of the results of
the automatic temporal clustering than a characterization on basis of the combined
frequencies of
cluster-related terms due to a big overlap of
general
ﬂood-related
vocabulary and a stronger inﬂuence of individual events in the latter case.
But
let
us
check again the potential
of
the combined frequencies
of
cluster
terms for an easy monitoring of
the development
of
the event.

Again,
each term bundle reaches its highest frequencies within that cluster it
is associated with,
and the rising and falling of the frequencies give signiﬁcant hints
towards an approaching phase boundary,
hence,
the start or end of a characteristic
temporal phase.
In context of event monitoring,
the use of aggregated frequencies of
characteristic cluster terms seems to be a good possibility that allows for an easier
and more eﬃcient implementation than the use of latent topics (compare Figures 9
and 11).
6.4 Comparison between temporal
structures in Facebook and Twitter
Comparing temporal
structures in both our social
media ﬂood corpora,
we,
ﬁrst
of all,
ﬁnd considerable overlap with respect to positions of phase boundaries and
general
phase characteristics.
Both corpora show an onset time span of four days,
starting on the 30th May for Twitter and 1st of June for Facebook,
where the focus
of contents is on informing and warning people and get organized in expectation
of the ﬂooding.
The acute status of the ﬂood event is enclosed inside a particular
cluster in both cases, starting on the 2nd June for Twitter and 4th June for Facebook
and extending to 12th June or 11th June,
respectively.
Besides information,
action
is the most prevalent theme in the second phase on both platforms.
The ﬁnal phase
on Facebook is spreading uniformly from 12th June towards our chosen endpoint
at 30th June and is dominated by social interaction,
empathy and positive emotions.

Twitter,
on the other
hand,

telling apart
a

to renew or persist.
As our generalized uniform temporal

media content,
we assume a three-fold division

(C) empathy and emotions,

extra
alertness/relief state related to a renewed rise of threat.
Beside great
commonalities,
there also appear
systematic diﬀerences
between
the two social
media platforms which can be interpreted in line with the general
characteristics of the platforms as previously described. The focus of Twitter content
is on up-to-date factual information on the event; so the frequency of tweets during
the information phase rises early and quickly. Facebook is prevalently used for social
interaction and organization of volunteer’s activities; accordingly,
it takes a little bit
longer for Facebook activities to get started but the level
of activity remains very
high during the whole second time segment.
Although both platforms put emphasis
on responsive actions and help,
Facebook is much more directly involved in the
organization of volunteer’s activities while Twitter is mostly taking an observing and
reporting point of view.
In the third main part of the event after the 12 June,
both
platforms show emotional
content.

a social level in form of empathy,
thankfulness and shared joy,
on Twitter they take
place on the factual level and emotional comments mostly relate to weather.
Finally,
the state of alertness that is brought in by Twitter but not by Facebook during the
last main part as an additional aspect,
reﬂects Twitter’s special attention to current
factual
information on weather conditions and water levels.
Since actually no new
great ﬂooding and damaging happened to take place,
Facebook users did not renew
their engagement in organizing responsive actions.
7 Discussion
7.1 Analysis of thematic structures for disaster management
In our investigation of thematic structures in German social media data relating to
the ﬂood in 2013,
we conducted a topic model
analysis using the LDA algorithm.
In face of the relatively unknown nature of social
media data,
our application of
LDA topic modelling included several
optimization steps as to set the parameters
of the models rather than referring to default values.
In result of our experiments,
we came to reveal
very reliable,
coherent
and meaningful
clusters of
content
by
direct application of the algorithm to social media.
This should be seen as disproval
of the common assumption (e.g.
Zhao et al.
2011) that direct application of topic
modelling to social media is not feasible.
A second,
more
general
common prejudice
in connection with social
media
analysis
in concrete user
scenarios
like disaster
management
is
that
structured
information extraction for social
media needs supervised methods with manually
prepared categories (e.g.
Palen et al.
2010; Starbird and Palen 2010; Vieweg et al.
2010; Starbird and Palen 2012; Imran et al.
2013; Reuter et al.
2013; Reuter and
Schr
¨
oter 2015).
This is based on the assumption that
results will
not
be directly
interpretable within the special
conceptual
framework established within the user
domain if categories are derived automatically within an unsupervised setting.
The
basic conceptual
schema we found in Section 2.3 in connection with a thematic
structuring of information in disaster management were the diﬀerent dimensions of
a crisis – the real event,
the actions of the involved organizations and the perception
of the crisis (BMI 2008).
Therefore,
in order to theoretically evaluate interpretability
of
our results within the end-user domain,
we should try and bring our topical
structures in relation to these pre-deﬁned three dimensions.
When reporting on our concrete results of topic model
analysis,
we had already
come to arrange the topics in both our corpora in some intuitive,
more general
order.
On the one hand,
there were the factual
and objective topics
concerned
with weather conditions,
water levels,
traﬃc obstruction and more general,
objective
aspects
of
the situation.
On the other
hand,
we had topics
related to concrete
actions and the organization of
help.
Finally,
there were emotional
topics,
either
talking about feelings in the context of social interaction (like empathy) or feelings
directed to the event (for instance,
weather conditions).
Notably,
there appears to be
a strong tendency for topics to belong either to one or the other dimension by being
prevalently concerned either with factual
information,
the organization of actions,
or with emotions.
Though,
there is not absolutely strict functional relation between
terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324918000025

Topics and topical
phases
255
topics and those more general
categories,
as one topic can show aspects of more
than one category to diﬀerent proportions (for instance, the subjective weather topic).
Comparing this intuitive more general
ordering of topical
content with the three-
dimensional ordering on the side of the disaster management conceptual framework,
we argue that
there is a very strong correspondence between the two conceptual
structures.
Just like the topics themselves have been created via soft clustering,
the
procedure for relating topics to crisis dimensions would be a soft categorization.
For ﬁnal testing of the interpretability and applicability of our topic model results,
we gathered informal
feedback from a group of
end-users from German disaster
management.
After being introduced to the general
idea of topics and a software
tool
making usable our models via a graphical
interface,
the end-users gained a
quick understanding of
the meaning of
the topics and their potential
use within
the context of their professional
work.
In sum,
the feedback of the end-users with
respect to our topic model results was very positive.
On the basis
of
our
successful
embedding of
topic categories
into theoretical
background of disaster management and taking into account the positive feedback
from end-users, there can be claimed good interpretability of our topic model results
in the user domain.
In face of
this,
the prejudice against
unsupervised methods
for
content
analysis
in concrete user
scenarios
like disaster
management
seems
not
justiﬁed.
Further
arguments
in favour
of
unsupervised approaches
for
crisis
informatics will be oﬀered in the next subsection.
Topic models can be used for a variety of purposes in the context given.
Well-
trained models for ﬂood-related Twitter and Facebook data are a powerful
tool
to
cope with the problem of information overload in context of disaster management
application and research as they give at hands a mean to automatically ﬁlter,
sort
and analyse huge amounts of social
media data.
For instance,
the inferred model
may provide a quick overview of
the content
of
a huge collection of
messages
and point out the main topics included there.
Moreover,
the model
could be used
to thematically order new incoming messages by providing topic labels and topic
probabilities to each of them. By being structured and ordered according to thematic
categories,
the information will get more comprehensible and suitable to eﬀectively
satisfy special information needs and particular interests of diﬀerent end-users from
disaster management.
Zooming in and out and changing your topical point of view
within a topic model lends great ﬂexibility to an end-user. In addition, the calculated
topic words can play the role of search and ﬁlter terms for retrieval
of more data
within a certain topic ﬁeld.
Such a topic-based approach to retrieval of social media
data in crisis management
can supplement
and reﬁne existing terminology-based
approaches (e.g.
Olteanu et al.
2014; Temnikova,
Castillo and Vieweg 2015).
As a supplementary focus of analysis,
thematic structures in the data from the
two social
media platforms
considered have been brought
under
a comparative
perspective. Results from topic modelling, sentiment analysis and diﬀerential analysis
revealed clear and systematic diﬀerences.
According to our study,
the main focus
of Facebook content is on empathy and emotions and on social
engagement and
Facebook generally takes the perspective of the aﬀected people.
Twitter,
in contrast,
is
mainly used for
exchange of
current
and concrete information on the event

and takes a more factual
point of view on the event.
This new insight concerning
systematic diﬀerences
in use of
German Facebook and Twitter
in context
of
a
crisis was ﬁrst made in our preparatory quantitative studies in Gr
¨
under and Schlaf
(2015) and put on a more elaborated methodical
basis in this paper.
Very recently,
it received general
support from a complementary study by Kaufhold and Reuter
(2016) using qualitative methods and interviews with Facebook group founders and
activists.
From the point of view of application,
these results can serve as an orientation
point for professional disaster managers who seek to successfully search for relevant
information in social media. At the same time, the outcome of our study can support
them to place their own information in the right context and in an appropriate style
as to gain people attention and trust.
7.2 Analysis of temporal
structures for disaster management
An additional
methodological
aspect we tested in connection with topic modelling
for social
media analysis is the temporal
dynamics of topic development
and the
suitability of topics as a basis for temporal clustering. On basis of topic distributions,
we successfully extracted coherent and meaningful
temporal
clusters with PAM in
both our
corpora without
further
supplementary steps
or
real
supervision.
This
speaks in favour of our new approach to temporal
clustering of social
media data
on basis of topics.
There was
a high correspondence between both corpora with respect
to the
number
of
clusters
as
well
as
the position of
important
phase boundaries.
The
variations in content of the respective phase between Facebook and Twitter can be
traced back to the systematic diﬀerences in the thematic proﬁle of
the platforms
as described in the previous subsection.
The same holds true for the additional
alertness/relief phase that occurred on the side of Twitter.
At this point,
though,
it
also should be recalled that we had pushed towards a more ﬁne-grained temporal
clustering in case of Twitter by choosing the second best number of clusters over
the one that had been chosen as the best by the automatic optimization algorithm
(compare Figure 8(b)).
This choice may,
furthermore,
have led to the eﬀect that the
interpretation of clusters in case of Twitter seemed not quite as easy and clear as in
case of Facebook,
especially for the last two clusters.
As before,
in order to prove interpretability of
our results from unsupervised
analysis within the user domain,
we will
look for correlation between the temporal
clusters we extracted and the concept of disaster management life cycle from Section
2.3,
either
described on a factual
level
(Baird,
2010)
and more or
less
related
to alarm levels
(LUBW and LfU 2015)
or
from a psychological
point
of
view
(Mahon 2011).
The three general phases we found when clustering on social media
topic distributions were information;
help;
empathy and emotions,
with an extra
alertness/relief-state for renewal
of
threat.
On the other side,
we have the most
basic disaster management life cycle with its soft categorization of temporal phases
into preparedness; response; recovery.
At the same side,
ﬁnally,
there are the short-
term parts of
the psychological
life cycle for a crisis or disaster including threat

phases
257
phase;
heroic phase;
honeymoon phase.
Comparing schemata on both sides,
we
again state that
there is a very strong correspondence between our structure and
categories and the structures and categories from within our application domain. The
communicative behaviour of seeking and oﬀering information during the ﬁrst phase
can directly be related to preparatory actions on the side of disaster management as
well
as to the sensation of threat.
The second communicative phase with its focus
on helpful
actions can be seen as the response phase in social
disguise and it goes
very well
with the predicted heroism on the psychological
level.
Finally,
the phase
characterized by high empathy and positive emotions relates to the ﬁrst phase of
recovery and very well
reﬂects the honeymoon feelings.
Our extra alertness/relief
phase can be interpreted as going back to a state of preparedness and feelings of
threat in face of new danger and living positive feelings of relief after the danger
passed.
Let
us further see whether we can even ﬁnd some rough correspondence with
respect
to the concrete timeline.
In Figure 1,
we had given the development
of
water level
and the corresponding alarm levels for the river of Elbe in the city of
Dresden.
Of course,
since the times of certain happenings or alarm levels reached
were slightly varying between diﬀerent locations in Germany and Austria our data
refer to,
we will
not aim at a precise match but rather expect to mirror the picture
just roughly.
Relating the alarm levels to disaster management phases,
we get the
following approximate dates: 1st to 3rd June preparatory phase; 4th to 10th June
response phase; from 14th onwards tendency recovery; higher renewed alert states
with control and watch around 13th and 27th June. Additionally, taking into account
weather warnings,
we get highest alarm levels around 2nd June and 19th/20th June.
Taking together
the alarm proﬁles
for
water
level
and weather
induce a phase
structure to the event that is very much corresponding to the structure we found on
basis of clustering on topical content of social media messages.
In overall,
we interpret these results as proving high correspondence between the
temporal
structures and categories we extracted on basis of topic distributions and
the ones assumed in disaster management and therefore claim high generality of our
schema and interpretability within the end-user domain. As before, positive feedback
from our group of end-users gave further conﬁrmation to this claim.
This means
unsupervised methods can successfully be applied in context of temporal
analysis
and clustering of social media data.
The approaches commonly used so far on basis
of
manual
labelling (e.g.
Parsons 2015)
or supervised methods (e.g.
Iyengar et al.
2011; Chowdhury et al.
2013; Yang et al.
2013) do not represent the only options.
Given the high dynamics of social media information,
permanent updating of the
information state is essential. We saw that the course of the event is directly mirrored
not only on the level of document frequencies but also on the level of diﬀerent topics
probabilities.
By tracking topics over time,
one can get a quick idea of the current
state of
an event,
the type of
information available or needed and the status of
the people at
a certain moment.
Likewise,
it
becomes
possible to observe and
analyse the overall
development of the situation and to possibly identify upcoming
trends or critical
situations in the social
dimension of the event.

during an emergency event,
is essential
if one wants to react timely and adequate
to information needs or emotional
demands of the public.
Temporal
clustering of
topical content allows categorizing typical stages of a certain type of event and get a
structured picture of its general generic life cycle on a social and communicative level.
Typical
stages can be correlated with typical
demands as well
as typical
potentials
and thereby can serve as a basis for a more systematic understanding of a current
situation. Moreover, understanding the life cycle of an event should enable improved
planning and organization of helpful actions.
By monitoring of characteristic phase
terms,
it might be possible to eﬀectively predict an oncoming phase transition and
therefore anticipate future demands.
The characteristic phase terms we extracted by
diﬀerential analysis strongly correlate with phase boundaries.
At this point,
further
research will be necessary in order to enable reliable application in end-user contexts.
8 Conclusion
Taking the ﬂood 2013 in Germany and Austria as our case study,
our study proved
high potential of social media content for German disaster management in all three
dimensions of a crisis.
Interestingly,
the two social
media platforms Facebook and
Twitter,
rather than just competing in the identical part of the media spectrum,
play
quite diﬀerent and complementary parts.
Moreover,
the temporal
development
of
social media content goes quite parallel with the varying interests end-users have at
diﬀerent temporal stages during the life cycle of a disaster.
With respect to the real event, social media is intensively used for sharing of up-to-
date information on diﬀerent factual aspects of the event (e.g.
weather,
water levels
and traﬃc obstruction) and for warnings.
In this way,
social
media can contribute
to the improvement of situational awareness and timeliness of early warnings in the
preparatory and response state. In the dimension of the activities related to the event,
social
media play a very important part in the organization of volunteer activities
and donations.
Here the potential
is to improve social
connectedness and concrete
support possibilities in the response and ﬁrst recovery stage.
From the point of view
of disaster management,
social
media provide perfect connection points to get into
immediate contact
with the volunteer’s movement
and bring it
from the current
state of independent private engagement into a state of organized participation.
As
for the perception of the crisis and its emotional
processing,
social
media provides
a good and frequently used possibility to directly show empathy,
provide emotional
support
or practice emotional
(self-)management.
In this way,
social
media are a
valuable resource for psychological
(self-)help especially during the recovery stage
of
a disaster.
Disaster
management
or
humanitarian organizations
can use the
platforms as ‘social sensors’
to get to know most directly about the emotional state
of the people and to better fulﬁl corresponding requirements.
The basis thematic categories and the temporal schemata we revealed in this study
give a quite general
picture of the structure of social
media communication during
a natural
disaster,
especially ﬂooding.
In overall,
our results should contribute to
further ﬁll the research gap with respect to properties of German social media crisis
communication and their potential
for disaster management
and,
moreover,
give

some input and impulse to interdisciplinary research, for instance in communication,
linguistics and media studies.
Taking the methodological
point of view,
our study proved the applicability of
unsupervised methods for structured information extraction in crisis informatics.
Especially,
we claim that
topic modelling techniques
are suitable for
analysing
social
media data in context
of
disaster
management
in the
thematic
as
well
as temporal
dimension.
With respect
to the thematic dimension,
we provided an
optimization workﬂow to adapt the LDA algorithm to the peculiarities of the new
data type. Regarding the temporal dimension, our investigation oﬀered a new way to
analyse topic evolution and temporally cluster highly dynamic data on basis of topic
distributions. We think that topic modelling techniques, as part of crisis management
software,
should be able to provide eﬃcient and ﬂexible computer-based access to
social media content to disaster managers.
9 Outlook
An implementation of topic modelling that was the core of our study has become part
of the general
text analytical
module of the integrated disaster management/social
media analysis software prototype that has been the outcome of the European project
Slandail
(Slandail
2014).
End-users have been involved in the development of the
system from design to testing.
Within the text analytical
module,
topic modelling
has got combined with other NLP functionality,
e.g.
geolocation or named entity
recognition,
in a very fruitful
way (see Gr
¨
under-Fahrer,
Schlaf,
Wustmann 2018).
The software module is currently under consideration by German authorities for
future use in German disaster management.
For further conﬁrmation and reﬁnement
of
our results and in order to grant
generalizability and future applicability of
our
models,
the methods
should be
applied and tested with respect to more events in future work.
Therefore,
we are
planning to apply and test our methods with respect to other ﬂood events or natural
disaster
of
a diﬀerent
kind as
soon as
appropriate German data are available.
Furthermore,
it
would certainly be interesting to extend this kind of
analysis to
diﬀerent
languages
and social
communities
as
to investigate commonalities
and
diﬀerences
in the
organization of
public,
collective
and individual
help,
social
behaviour,
sociolinguistics and media use.
In our current research,
we are also widening our focus as to include other types
of crisis events,
in particular,
we are interested in man-made crises where messages
on social media not only arise in reaction to the event but play a very active part in
causing it.
Here,
we are analysing the role of social media in the current nationalist,
anti-Islam,
far-right political movement in Germany (e.g.
Pegida).
In terms of further research in the ﬁeld of topic modelling and temporal clustering,
we want
to extend the identiﬁcation of
temporal
phases
in a more ﬁne-grained
resolution.
Wang,
Agichtein and Benzi
(2012),
for instance,
propose TM–LDA,
a
method to identify and predict typical changes of topics in social network feeds over
time.
For disaster management,
this may provide interesting insights to (1) separate
early adopters and late-comers among users,
(2) learn about the diﬀerent local

temporal proliferation of news and (3) allow for prediction of trends from live data
streams.
Finally,
much more
should be
said and done
regarding the
adaptation of
other NLP methods to the peculiarities of
social
media language and to special
characteristics of German.
In our study,
we consciously focused on optimization of
our core method only and treated the problem on a general
rather than language-
speciﬁc level.
Here,
many interesting questions are still open for future research and
we hope to contribute to answering some of them with our own future work.
